397	56.1	The devices are supposed to deploy with enough force to provide protection in milliseconds preventing dangerous impacts with other parts of a car	1
397	56.2	he bags at issue appear prone to deploy too violently creating metal shards and propelling them toward people in the car The problem has been linked to four US deaths and many injuries  including those of Stephanie Erdman who testified before a Senate panel on Thursday that she was blinded in one eye after her Honda air bag deployed	1
397	56.3	Air bags in humid places seem to be more at risk suggesting some interaction between chemicals used to deploy air bags and moisture	1
397	56.4	All owners deserve notice that they might have a defective air bag that should be replaced	1
397	55.1	y 34 million cars and trucks nationwide were declared defective Tuesday because of deadly air bags made by autoparts giant Takata	1
397	55.2	he expanded recall doubled the number of vehicles believed to have the air bags which can blast out sharp metal shrapnel when deployed a flaw that has been linked to six deaths and more than 100 injuries	1
397	55.3	millions who drive some of the most popular models from BMW Ford Honda Toyota and other carmakers could remain behind the wheel with a defect that lawmakers have deemed a public safety threat	1
397	55.4	eral officials said years of humid weather along with other factors could cause the propellant in driver and passengerside airbag inflaters to burn hotter than it should leading to shardblasting ruptures that Takata blamed on overaggressive combustion	1
397	55.5	investigation by Takata automakers and independent researchers has yet to point to a definitive cause behind the ruptures leading safety advocates to worry that replacement parts could have the same fatal flaw	1
397	55.6	its defective parts have been found in dozens of car and truck models made since 2000	1
397	55.7	the root cause of these deadly deployments is still unknown	1
397	55.8	Foxx called it a major step forward for public safety adding We will not stop our work until every air bag is replaced	1
397	55.9	Orlando lawyer Richard Newsome represents seven clients who say they were injured by Takata air bags	1
397	55.10	One Florida man Corey Burdick said he was blinded in one eye last year after the air bag in his 2001 Honda Civic deployed sending a metal projectile into his face	1
397	55.11	We still dont know how this is happening Newsome said Are the replacement air bags going to have the same problem	1
397	54.1	303 drivers and frontseat passengers died in accidents in which airbags did not inflate in two models that the automaker recalled last month	1
397	54.2	GM announced last month that it was recalling 16million vehicles to repair the defective part which the automaker said had played a role in 12 deaths	1
397	54.3	Previously GM said there were 13 deaths	1
397	54.4	For its part GM said that the Friedman analysis did not determine why the airbags did not deploy in the fatal accidents	1
397	53.1	h Takata still doesnt know why its defective air bags killed six drivers the carparts giant is continuing to use a chemical that experts have blamed for the deadly defect the company said Tuesday during a congressional hearing into the biggest auto recall in history	1
397	53.2	Nearly 34 million cars and trucks or about 1 in 7 on US roads have been recalled because Takata air bags can blast shrapnel when deployed and have led to more than 100 injuries	1
397	53.3	Even after months of testing Takata says it has no firm answer for what went wrong	1
397	53.4	it would still take two weeks for automakers to say which cars are affected and experts say it could take years for all cars to be repaired	1
397	53.5	Many of the cars now being fixed Rosekind added may need to be repaired again because Takata one of the worlds biggest airbag makers is installing temporary fixes in new cars and replacement units while the root cause of the problem remains unknown	1
397	53.6	Weve got a young lady sitting over your shoulder bearing the scars of a mistake that was made and were still not getting the answers said Rep Markwayne Mullin ROkla pointing to an audience member injured by a defective air bag	1
397	53.7	Were doing a recall and replacing parts with parts that are still faulty Theres no excuse for that	1
397	53.8	Takata blamed most of the ruptures including those that killed US drivers on older air bags with faulty batwingshaped wafers which hold the propellant that helps the air bag inflate on command	1
397	53.9	he company said it would stop making the batwing inflaters and replace all older parts But Takata has not stopped using ammonium nitrate even though Kennedy said the compound was certainly a factor in some accidents	1
397	53.10	Aggravated by years of heat and humidity the inexpensive propellant can explode a flaw that former Takata engineers have told lawmakers should have prevented its use in passenger cars	1
397	53.11	Rosekind said a full plan for recall fixes may not be ready for the public until the fall leaving tens of millions of defective cars on the road	1

397	51.3	About 29 million vehicles made by various automakers have been recalled in the US to replace Takata airbag inflators that can spray drivers and passengers with shards of metalWhen a vehicle is involved in a collision sensors ignite a solid wafer of chemical propellant inside the metal canister of the airbag inflator A chemical reaction creates a gas that inflates the bag within milliseconds popping it from the steering wheel or dashboardBut if the propellant burns faster than intended it produces more gas than the vents into the airbag can handle The metal canister can break into fragments that spray the driver or passengers	1
397	51.4	Prolonged exposure to hot humid weather is believed to contribute to the Takata malfunctions although some have occurred in vehicles used elsewhere	1
397	50.1	Honda already has been hit hard by recalls with close to 10 million vehicles under recall because of defective air bags that can spray drivers and passengers with shrapnel when the devices deploy At least five people have been killed by the bags four of them in the United States	1
397	49.1	ransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said Friday that the worlds largest airbag maker Takata will be fined 14000 a day until it complies with federal demands for more information on air bags that have killed six people and maimed dozens more	1
397	49.2	Those air bags can explode with such force that they have grievously injured people and in a halfdozen cases killed them Foxx said	1
397	49.3	The metal inflation canisters on some Takata air bags have been shattered by the propellent they contain spraying drivers and passengers with shards of metal	1
397	49.4	Weve pushed hard to get millions of defective Takata air bags off our roads said Foxx	1
397	49.5	ost recent death attributed to a Takata air bag that of Carlos Solis 35 near Houston last month came in a used car that was under recall when he bought it NHTSA said	1
397	49.6	Takata has moved cautiously when pressed to identify the cause of the deadly airbag deployments or acknowledge its fault	1
397	49.7	Ten auto manufacturers  Toyota Honda Mazda Mitsubishi General Motors Subaru Ford Chrysler BMW and Nissan  have issued airbag recalls since the problem emerged more than six years ago	1
397	49.8	NHTSA believes that the inflator propellant used by Takata ammonium nitrate burns faster than intended after exposure to prolonged moisture in the air A fast burn can cause an explosion of the metal canister that is supposed to contain the explosion	1
397	48.1	al regulators said Tuesday that fewer cars than first thought will be recalled for faulty air bags	1
397	48.2	call of cars equipped with Takata air bags remains the biggest recall in US history	1
397	48.3	They said data collected from Takata and automakers has been shared with the Department of Justice which is considering civil or criminal action against Takata which allegedly knew about problems with the bags without notifying federal officials	1
397	48.4	At least eight deaths and numerous injuries have been tied to faulty air bags made by Takata which inflate with so much force that they spray a driver or passengers with metal shards	1

397	45.3	At the hearing members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce are expected to confront Hiroshi Shimizu a Takata senior vice president with the suspicion that his company has replaced airbag inflators in more than 8 million vehicles with devices no better than the ones being recalled	1
397	45.4	akata has not disclosed whether it has made any changes to the design specifications or manufacturing processes for the replacement inflators says a memo prepared for the hearing by the committees staff	1
397	45.5	In discussions with staff most vehicle manufacturers indicated that they were replacing the inflators with like parts indicating that it was the same inflator with the same propellant presumably manufactured the same way but of a newer vintage	1
397	45.6	Our members are hoping to gain a better understanding at Wednesdays hearing of what is different and what improvements if any have been made in the manufacturing process	1

397	44.2	Since last year 10automakers have recalled 78million vehicles with Takata air bags most of them in humid regions of the country where the defect has been most evident	1
397	44.3	A growing number of these inflators have ruptured projecting metal fragments into vehicle occupants thereby creating an unreasonable risk of death and injury At least five people have died  four of them in the United States  and scores have been injured when metal from the inflator cannister has sprayed them as the airbag has deployed	1
397	44.4	Takata has admitted to production problems at its Washington state plant and theorized that the airbag malfunctions were caused by persistent exposure to high humidity	1
397	44.5	In his Wednesday letter to Takata however Borris said recent cases demonstrate that the problem is not limited to humid regions He cited instances this year when the California driver of a Honda and the North Carolina driver of a Ford were cut and burned by shrapnel from defective Takata air bags	1
397	44.6	NHTSA is issuing this recall request letter to notify you that the agency has tentatively concluded that a defect related to motor vehicle safety exists on a national basis	1

414	80.1	President Obamas surprising move toward normalizing relations with Cuba amounts to a big bet that the nation  and particularly the crucial swing state of Florida  has turned a political corner from the Cold War era	1
414	80.2	Obamas decision aligns with a growing sentiment that current Cuba policy has become counterproductive	1
414	80.3	than a decade ago polls began showing a tilt in public sentiment toward normalizing ties with the island 90 miles from the tip of Key West Fla	1

815	156.1	The closeddoor nature of the trial has been condemned by journalism organizations The Washington Post and the State Department It certainly adds to concerns and it fits unfortunately into a pattern of a complete lack of transparency and lack of due process that weve seen since Jason was detained said Jeff Rathke deputy spokesman for the State Department	1

815	155.5	Until Jason is free his treatment by Iran can only be seen as an abomination worthy of the worlds condemnation	1
815	155.6	As of today my brother Jason has been held in Irans Evin prison for nearly eight months This is twice as long as any other western journalist Throughout his ordeal Jason has been subjected to intense interrogation isolation and has been denied timely medical treatment The Iranian government has never provided evidence of any wrongdoing on his part and they have systematically ignored their own legal process to extend his detention deprive Jason of his right to legal counsel and deny virtually all his protections under the Iranian constitution As you can imagine Jasons imprisonment has been tremendously difficult on him For nearly five months Jason was held in solitary confinement frequently interrogated for 710 hours per day and then subjected to weeklong periods of isolation Within the first two months of his detention Jason lost nearly 50 pounds He suffered though months of debilitating back pain and serious infections exacerbated by delays in treatment I am happy to report that in the recent months Jason has been treated by appropriate physicians and has been moved from solitary into a shared cell But while we are told that his physical condition has improved we know that these past 8 months have taken a great toll on his psychological condition Any person subjected to these conditions would be psychologically scarred but in Jasons case there is the added burden of knowing that without even the pretense of evidence the country which he worked so hard to demystify to the world continues to deprive him of his rights and ignores their legal process to prevent him from presenting a defense1
815	155.7	While Jasons wife Yeganeh was released on bail after nearly two months in Evin she continues to suffer For months she was forbidden to consult an attorney Her press credentials were revoked and she lives in constant fear of punishment for any misstep in her daily life	1

829	169.3	As we move into the next decade that will give way to exploiting the real potential of unmanned systems Thats when a lot of the changes to doctrine and strategy will begin to take effect	1
829	169.4	ore unmanned systems the Pentagon operates the more bandwidth they require and the more money the Defense Department has to spend on commercial satellite contracts to carry those transmissions	1
829	169.5	t takes a smart machine to recognize and respond to changing conditions Part of the solution lies in building dronesand equipping them in adaptable ways	1
829	168.1	In what will probably be considered a step forward for autonomous military technology the Pentagon said in a statementMonday that it had successfully demonstrated one of the worlds largest microdrone swarms over China Lake	1
829	167.1	Force is grappling with how to manage a potential glut of drones and may eventually scale back the number of combat missions flown with unmanned aircraft by more than 25 percent the services top commander said Wednesda	1
829	167.2	plans pushed by thenDefense Secretary Robert M Gates at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars the Air Force was supposed to buy enough drones and train enough crews so that it could fly 65 combat air patrols roundtheclock by 2013	1
829	167.3	I dont know where were going to go but building bigger more expensive more cosmic drones probably isnt the answer Welsh said Theres nothing cheap about them	1
829	167.4	Welsh told reporters that the Air Force needs to spend more on other methods to conduct reconnaissance and gather intelligence from the air	1
829	167.5	e declined to be specific but other Air Force officials have advocated more money for satellites manned spy planes and advanced stealth drones as well as morepowerful electronic sensors for surveillance	1
829	167.6	coming years for example the Air Force plans to buy more than 1700 F35 Lightning II fighter jets will replace many of its aging refueling tankers and is designing a new longrange stealth bombe	1
829	167.7	ll of those airplanes will cost exponentially more than most types of drones We dont exist to fight a counterinsurgency Welsh said referring to the types of wars fought in Iraq and Afghanistan We can help in that but air forces  major air forces  exist to fight fullspectrum conflict against a wellarmed welltrained determined foe	1
829	165.1	ir Force units that run the services fleet of drone aircraft are under significant stress with long hours and a potential brain drain coming that will prompt a variety of changes Air Force Secretary Deborah James said Thursday	1
829	165.2	Our plan is designed to immediately relieve some of this strain while still meeting the combatant commander requirements and then we of course recognize well have more work to do for the somewhat longer term to address the people side of this very important but nonetheless highdemand weapons system James sai	1
829	165.3	The Air Force also has another related problem on the horizon she said appearing alongside Chief of Staff Gen	1
829	165.4	Many of the services experienced drone pilots are nearing the end of their activeduty contracts at the same time	1
829	165.5	f the service cant retain enough of them that would effectively amount to a brain drain in a force filling a vital mission over Iraq Syria and other conflict zones Several options are on the table to address the issues James and Welsh said	1
829	165.6	The service also may boost pay for drone operators the secretary added	1
829	165.7	Previously service policy did not allow Air Force officials to offer retention bonuses to drone pilots who are only qualified to fly unmanned aircraft but the service is working to change that she said	1
829	165.8	As our experienced operators reach the end of their initial activeduty service commitment we will increase the monthly incentive pay from 650 a month to 1500 for those drone pilots while we also explore more permanent incentive plans which will be a little bit more down the road she sai	1
829	165.9	The service also is considering recruiting pilots from other services he said	1
829	164.1	They say increased training for new and existing pilots along with steps to improve pilot recruitment and retention is crucial to maintaining the effectiveness of an overstressed force and would help the Air Force meet future demand for remotely piloted flight	1
829	164.2	is the centerpiece of an effort to make the pace of Air Force drone operations more sustainable and to help heal the stresses caused by a decade of frenetic expansion	1
829	164.3	he demand for unmanned aircrafts surveillance and combat powers is higher than ever	1
829	164.4	In 2001 the Air Force was only capable of keeping two drones flying combat missions at a time Behind every drone in the air conducting a combat air patrol there are hundreds of personnel required to maintain active and reserve aircraft and amass intelligence and even special teams deployed overseas dedicated to takeoff and landing of aircraft	1
829	164.5	By 2010 during President Obamas surge of troops to Afghanistan the programs flight capacity had reached 39 It peaked at 65 in 2014	1
829	164.6	Today the Air Force needs to produce 300 new drone pilots a year Because of recruitment and training constraints it is only producing 180The Air Force also loses 240 drone pilots each year as airmen return to other duties or they leave the service altogether	1
829	164.7	he 500 pilots and 500 sensor operators at Creech nestled among bare hillsides an hours drive from Las Vegas have pushed themselves hard in recent years to keep pace with the demands of overseas operation	1
829	164.8	Earlier this year the Air Force announced plans to address gaps in drone pilots including larger retention bonuses and greater use of reservists National Guard personnel and contractors	1

847	235.6	In 1998 a study published in the prestigious medical journal the Lancet suggested that the measles mumps and rubella vaccine could cause autism The research by Andrew Wakefield was later discredited and the study was retracted by the journal in 2010 But the paper set off a movement among people who continue to believe that there could be a link between the vaccine and autism It has been fanned by the support of some celebrities Vaccination is also opposed by some people on religious grounds and some states allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children based on personal beliefs California epicenter of the current outbreak is one of them	1
847	235.7	Doctors are free to tinker with the schedule a bit he said But that becomes a problem when some parents decide to delay vaccinations by months and even years he said In that case children are going too long without critically needed protections against very serious illnesses he said	1

847	231.1	s diseases that we normally think of as rare in the United States are making a comeba	1
847	231.2	Although its a complex problem health officials say one key culprit is that more and more people are choosing not to get their kids vaccinated against these disease	1
847	231.3	For instance in California parents are increasingly seeking personal or religious exemptionsfrom vaccination requirements for their kids to attend schools Substandard vaccination rates create an opening for outbreaks which often start when an unvaccinated person catches the disease while traveling abroad and spreads the illness to friends and family upon returning	1
847	231.4	any of the diseases we vaccinate against are so rare here now that the publics awareness of vaccination might have decreased	1
847	231.5	But the one reason that has most alarmed publichealth experts lately has been the rise of the antivaccine movement Groups and activists such as celebrity Jenny McCarthy have repeatedly claimed that vaccines cause autism This vaccineautism concern may be causing a drop in childhood vaccination ratesin many communities includingin affluent welleducated ones	1
847	231.6	Antivaccine activists have also raised concerns about vaccines made with the mercurybased preservative known as thimerosal which they worry could cause brain damage in developing kids	1
847	231.7	Vaccines do carry a risk of side effects but they are usually minor	1
847	230.1	This has raised obvious concerns both because of the overall antivaccination movement in this country	1
847	230.2	Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy among othershave been given large platforms from which to express their views about the dangers of vaccinations even though the gas that seemingly fueled the antivaccination movement for so long	1
847	230.3	A recent study found that these people are clustered together which means that measles a highlycontagious disease can more easily spread to additionalchildren	1
847	230.4	Themajority of people who get measles have not been vaccinated In California for example half of the people with measles in the current outbreak have not been vaccinated and vaccination status is still not known for many of the others	1
847	230.5	he study ultimately found that while endemic measles was still eliminated international importation remained a serious risk As long as people are traveling to and fromother countries and as long as some of these people may be unvaccinated and they may come into contact with other unvaccinated people the risk remains of measles cases in the United States	1
847	230.6	The vaccination status of 34 of these peopleis known the health department said and all but six of those people had not been vaccinated	1
847	229.1	Authorities have blamed the spread of a disease that was eliminated in 2000 largely on people who for personal or religious reasons are choosing not to have their children vaccinated or are delaying their immunizations	1
847	229.2	welve of the unvaccinated patients were infants who could not be vaccinated because they were too young the measles vaccine is not recommended for children under a year of age Among the other 37 28 76 were intentionally unvaccinated because of personal beliefs and one was on an alternative plan for vaccination they wrote	1
847	228.1	The outbreak has generated sometimes fierce criticism of people who for personal reasons or because they mistrust the vaccine choose not to have their children immunized and prompted at least two school systems in California to ban unvaccinated students from school	1
847	228.2	Measles which is caused by a virus is highly contagious The respiratory illness is airborne spread from person to person by coughing and sneezing It is so infectious that an unvaccinated person can contract it by inhaling the virus hours after a person with the disease has left a room	1
847	227.1	But measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to science People with measles can spread the infection for four days before the onset of the rash and four days after That means people are contagious before they know they have measles	1
847	227.2	Vaccines arent completely effective but if youve had both measles vaccines your chances of becoming infected after being exposed to the virus are less than 2 percent	1
847	227.3	But all states other than Mississippi and West Virginia allow parents not to vaccinate their children because of the familys religious beliefs Nineteen states also allow parents that option if the vaccinations are against their personal beliefs	1
847	226.1	According to theLos Angeles Timesmore than 13000 California kindergarten students have waivers due to their parents personal beliefs with more than 2700of those based on religious beliefs1
847	226.2	ever significant numbers of Americans think vaccines are harmful to the health of children despite the absence of supporting evidence and are egged on by a few medical professionals as well as some libertarian	1
847	226.3	As we have learned in the past month parents who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their own family at risk but they also endanger other families who choose to vaccinate	1
847	225.1	But today the number of unvaccinated children has begun to become a problem Schuchat said Some people are choosing not to have their children immunized for personal reasons and others are unaware of or unable to get vaccinations before they arrive in the US	1
847	225.2	In a separate commentary Thursday in the Annals of Internal Medicine epidemiologist Julia Shaklee Sammons warned that as more parents decline to vaccinate their children measles incidence is increasinga fact that alarms me both as a hospital epidemiologist and as a parent of a vulnerable infant too young to receive the measles vaccine	1
847	225.3	The vaccine is about 97 percent effective said CDC official Gregory S Wallace so about three in 100 people who are vaccinated and exposed to the infection will contract it	1
847	225.4	Twentyfive of the people infected were not immunized19 of them because of philosophical objectionsand 18 more had no documentation of vaccinations Three were too young for routine vaccination and three others were not vaccinated for unknown reasons Eleven had received two or more doses of vaccine that did not protect them	1
847	224.1	Health officials say the outbreak is a direct result of the increasing number of people  particularly in California  who have chosen to remain unvaccinated partly because of the erroneous belief that vaccinations can cause autism	1
847	224.2	When measles patients cough or sneeze droplets spray into the air and the droplets remain active and contagious for up to two hours	1
847	224.3	Its unclear how many people have been exposed to the man who was diagnosed in Pinal County after he came in contact with the same family that had been to Disneylan	1

852	240.1	orass of conflicting information about ecigarettes and tobacco use grew deeper Monday when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new study showing that adolescents who vape say they are much more likely to smoke conventional cigarettes	1
852	240.2	With tobacco and ecig companies marketing heavily to young people and 80 percent of cigarette smokers starting the habit by age 18 the CDC considers intervening with this age group critic1
852	242.1	Whats most surprising is how incredibly rapid the use of products other than cigarettes has increased Frieden said in an interview addingthat some ecigarette smokers would undoubtedly go on to use traditional cigarettes	1
852	242.2	Antismoking advocates argue that the rise in the popularityof ecigarettes stems in part from aggressive largely unregulated marketing campaigns that Frieden said are straight out of the playbook of cigarette ads that targeted young people in earlier generations	1
852	242.3	But he was quick to add the explosion of ecigarette use among kids means these products are being taken up in record numbers with totally unknown longterm consequences that could potentially undermine all the progress weve made	1
852	242.4	The failure of the FDA to move more quickly means we have an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed he said	1
852	242.5	Instead they are using this as another opportunity to demonize ecigarettes	1
852	242.6	The initial proposals stopped short of halting online sales of ecigarettes restricting television advertising or banning the use of candy and fruit flavorings that critics say are intended to appeal to young smokers	1
852	241.1	Matthew Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids called the FDAs action an important step but said that it is inexcusable that the agency had taken so long to ac	1
852	241.2	Regulators at this point are not seeking to halt online sales of ecigarettes curb television advertising or ban the use of flavorings such as watermelon grape soda and pia colada  all tactics that critics say are aimed at attracting young smokers and that have been banned for traditional cigarettes	1
852	241.3	But they will have two years to submit applications to the FDA to approve their products which can remain on the market in the meantime	1
852	241.4	A lot of these companies they are supporting several employees investing any profits back into their buisness  They cant afford this and its going to lead to a whole lot of consolidation and increased prices for consumers	1
852	241.5	They cant move forward at the same pace that they have been moving and do their job protecting public health Myers said We cant waste another five years this cannot take that long There is a moral and public health imperative for them to treat this with the urgency it deserves	1
852	241.6	On the other hand if ecigarettes do hold the potential to help some people quit smoking the agency doesnt want to stymie innovation and crush an industry thats quickly evolving Its a tricky balance Warner said	1
852	241.7	That fueled concerns among some public health officials that the devices could lead users toward traditional smoking	1
852	258.1	But the lead author David T Levy of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University spoke more directly about vaping in a university press release We believe that the discussion to date has been slanted against ecigarettes Levy says in a press release about the journal piece Were concerned the FDA which has asserted its right to regulate ecigarettes will focus solely on the possibility that ecigarettes and other vapor nicotine products might act as a gateway to cigarette use Levy says This is unfortunate he continues because these products appear to be used mostly by people who already are or who are likely to become cigarette smokers	1
852	257.1	But if a nonsmoker starts vaping and gets hooked on nicotine especially if it leads to tobacco smoking thats a problem	1
852	257.2	Another study found that teenagers who smoke and vape tend to smoke more conventional cigarettes than those who smoke but dont use ecigs	1
852	256.1	Such regulation sounds likea good idea but new research suggests it may backfire A forthcoming paperin theJournal of Health Economics finds that bans on teen access to ecigarettes mayincrease teen smoking rates	1
852	256.2	he bottom line Not only could poorly conceived ecigarette regulation undermine public health	1
852	256.3	Wellintentioned public health measures do not always protect public health	1
852	256.4	Regulation of new technologies is sometimes justified but it can also do more harm than good	1
852	256.5	Premature or poorly constructed regulation of ecigarettes may compromise smokingreduction efforts and as our research suggests advance the interests of tobacco companies	1
852	255.1	The FDAs initial proposals stopped short of halting online ecigarette sales restricting television advertising or banning candy and fruit flavorings  chocolate cotton candy passion fruit pia colada and hundreds of others  that critics say appeal to young users	1
852	255.2	A year later the FDA has yet to finalize any new regulations involving ecigarette	1
852	255.3	But ecigarettes do not face the same federal restrictions on television and radio advertising that apply to traditional cigarettes These are the same images the same themes and the same role models that the cigarette industry used 50 years ago said Matthew Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids	1
852	254.1	Regulators at this point are not seeking to halt online sales of ecigarettes curb television advertising or ban the use of flavorings such as watermelon grape soda and pia colada  all tactics that critics say are aimed at attracting young smokers and that have been banned for traditional cigarettes	1
852	251.1	But in early May it delayed for three months the enforcement of some regulations that were to be imposed for the first time on ecigarettes and cigars	1
852	250.1	Many teens who start with ecigarettes may be condemned to struggling with a lifelong addiction to nicotine and conventional cigarettes	1
852	250.2	Although the Food and Drug Administration has long said it intends to expand its regulatory authority over tobacco products to include ecigarettes the agency has not done so	1
852	250.3	ecigarette companies have remained free to sell their products online and spend huge sums mimicking the advertising practices that big tobacco companies once used	1
852	246.1	However the proposal stopped short of seeking restrictions on online sales of ecigarettes or television advertising	1
852	246.2	And 18 months later the FDA still has not finalized any of those new regulations	1
852	245.1	he debate reignited last week after the academic journal Tobacco Controlpublished a study claiming that ecigarettes serve as a oneway bridge among young people to smoking combustible cigarettes	1
852	245.2	The study found that those who had vaped in 2014 were more than four times as likely to have reported smoking tobacco products in the following year	1
852	245.3	the National Institute on Drug Abuse already proclaims on its website that young people who vape are more likely to try tobacco products	1
852	245.4	r is that vaping isnt a healthy habit	1
852	245.5	Some brands also contain formaldehyde which increases the risk of cancer and a few flavorings added to ecig vapor contain diacetyl which has long been associated with a lung disease called popcorn lung Just last week researchers at Johns Hopkins also found high levels of toxic metals in ecigarette vapo	1
852	245.6	But even the most ardent supporters of ecigarettes should admit that the surge in teen vaping is probably not a good thing whether or not it leads to increased tobacco use	1
852	244.1	It is delaying for several years a key regulation affecting cigars and ecigarettes including flavored vaping products that studies show are especially enticing to youth	1
852	244.2	Not only is FDA delaying the timetable for ecigarettes he noted but also the one for cigars cigarillos and hookah  currently sold in convenient stores in kidfriendly flavors likegrape and tropical punch flavors	1
852	244.3	it could cause smokers to smoke more deeply or in greater amounts to compensate warned some researchers	1
852	244.4	Others in the past have expressed concerns that the withdrawal it could imbalance smokers with mental illnesses  who make up a huge proportion of the people still smoking in the United States	1
852	244.5	t could create a black market for higher nicotine cigarettes Depending on how the plan is implemented	1
852	244.6	he said because gradually lowering nicotine could lead to problems like causing smokers to smoke more	1
852	239.1	But almost everyone agreed that the details of how the agency eventually regulates the rapidly evolving 2billionayear ecigarette industry will shape it dramatically and could have profound effects on public healt	1
852	239.2	A lot of these companies they are supporting several employees investing any profits back into their business	1

854	276.3	People aged 65 now live about six years longer and retire even earlier than they did in 1940 when the system first paid benefits That means families like Clintons Trumps and mine will be getting hundreds of thousands of dollars more in lifetime benefits than they would have when the system was first created while many future elderly will still be left in poverty	1

883	456.2	The batteries aboard Solar Impulse 2 overheated on the first day of its trip from Japan to Hawaii and there was no way to cool down the system the team said The company says there was no weakness with the technology but the team didnt anticipate temperature fluctuations associated with rapid altitude changes in a tropical climate	1

911	548.2	but which the agency itself considers very highly toxic to bees	1
911	548.3	At a time when honeybees and other pollinators are dying in greater numbers than ever before EPAs decision to remove restrictions on yet another beekilling pesticide is nothing short of reckless	1
911	548.4	Some of the losses have been associated with events such as massive wildfires in the west the wet winter in the Midwest and hurricanes in the Southeast	1
911	548.5	ut the bee losses documented over the past decade are often blamed in no small part on the increased use of fungicides herbicides and certain pesticides Sulfoxaflor was initially approved by the EPA in 2013 but a collection of beekeepers and other opponents sued the agency over its use saying studies made it clear that it was highly toxic to honeybees	1
911	548.6	The agency also has repeatedly granted emergency waivers to states to allow the use of sulfoxaflor on certain crops because of a lack of effective alternatives for farmers	1
911	547.1	ennich points to the three months of California wildfires with bees affected by smoke and by the lack of plants on which to forage	1
911	547.2	She also cited the wet winter in the Midwest and the springs slow planting schedule	1
911	547.3	But drought fires hurricanes and the Midwests bomb cyclone are just the start of bee woes	1
911	547.4	The honeybee crisis of the past decade is often blamed on increased use of fungicides herbicides such as Monsantos Roundup and pesticides called neonicotinoids	1
911	547.5	In addition to colony collapse disorder in recent years bees have suffered from viruses carried by varroa mites as well as problems with queen vigor weakened immune systems and poor nutrition	1
911	547.6	Hackenberg is convinced that pesticide herbicide and fungicide use is the culprit  and there is a lot more fungicide sprayed in a really wet spring  while Rennich said there may be other contributing factors such as monocropping the growing of a single crop on the same plot year after year which reduces forage for bees and the movement of hiredpollinator bees risking the spread of disease1
911	547.7	said that while extreme weather has worsened honeybees plight the biggest threat is varroa mite	1
911	547.8	It has been hard to develop a chemical compound that will kill the mites without killing the bees	1
911	547.9	eople can get their mite population down to zero and then they stop monitoring This requires constant monitoring	1
911	547.10	That number was bumped up to 34 million in April 2018 to deal with the years large number of natural disasters	1
911	546.1	We know there are multiple things that are hurting the bees	1
911	546.2	He also introduces different nutrients since poor nutrition has been linked to the collapse of bee colonies	1
911	546.3	Evans was an early proponent of mapping and studying the genome of honeybees and also has been working on sequencing the genome of the Varroa mite in order to develop novel control methods for this pest which is harmful to honeybees	1
911	545.1	While disease and parasites have likely played a major role in the decline of the honeybee human influence  including habitat destruction and pesticide use  are also thought to have been major contributors	1
911	545.2	This information could prove very useful in understanding how climate change will affect populations of honey bees said Gene Robinson director of the Carl R Woese Institute for Genomic Biology and the Illinois Bee Research Facility at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign in an email to The Post	1
911	544.1	argescale studies published Thursday suggest that common pesticides may harm bee colonie	1
911	544.2	In some cases the pesticides contribute to the loss of not only worker bees but also queen	1
911	544.3	The studies in the journal Science have been eagerly anticipated because ofconcerns about the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators but the results were not as clearcut as experts had hoped	1
911	544.4	Both studies showed negative but different effects on bees and demonstrated that bees are picking up neonicotinoids from surprising sources	1
911	544.5	n Britain many of the bees fell prey to the dreaded Varroa destructor mite  a hairy fanged parasite that many bee experts blame for the majority of losses that occur in commercial honeybee operations	1
911	544.6	In Hungary a fungal infestation devastated the bees in the study	1
911	544.7	That bees in Britain and Hungary but not Germany were adversely affected by neonicotinoid exposure suggests that the pesticides may exacerbate deadlier pressures bees face such as parasites	1
911	544.8	In another complication when the researchers in Europe sampled the nests of bumble bees and solitary bees for pesticide residues they found contamination with one type of neonicotinoid not used in the study This was surprising because there is a moratorium on the use of the pesticides to treat seeds of flowering plants in the European Union This supports previously proposed hypotheses that neonicotinoids which are water soluble might persist in the soil and that the bees were picking up chemicals applied before the ban	1
911	544.9	In the Canadian study scientists found that bees were exposed to 26 different pesticides Neonicotinoids were present far below dangerous levels but the exposure continued for months Surprisingly the bulk of contaminated pollen didnt come from crops treated with the pesticide but from wildflowers nearby That adds to the evidence that neonicotinoids might move through the soil and get picked up by other plants	1
911	544.10	Finally neonicotinoids when mixed with a certain fungicide were more toxic than either alone	1
911	544.11	he pesticides are chemically similar to nicotine which evolved in plants as a natural defense against insect predators	1
911	544.12	Neonicotinoids are commonly used to treat seeds or soil before planting They move through the plant providing allover defense throughout development	1
911	544.13	he new studies suggesting that neonicotinoids seem to persist in the soil may help explain how bees which do not forage on windpollinated corn could still be exposed near fields of treated corn seeds In terms of how neonicotinoids effect bees in the field many questions remain	1
911	544.14	Wildflower refuges could also address an even greater threat to bees  habitat loss	1
911	544.15	Many bee experts emphasize the importance of considering how changes to all landscapes could help or harm the pollinators we depend on	1
911	543.1	Environmental and other publicinterest groups often cite pesticides as a leadingculprit	1
911	543.2	ctivists argue that these pesticidesnot only kill honeybees but may be behind the different more mysteriousset of symptoms known as colony collapse disorder CCD	1

911	543.6	he European Union decided it wasnt going to take any chances so it banned neonicotinoids for two years saying not only that the pesticides can kill beesbut that they may carry other risks we arent aware of yet	1
911	543.7	n short there are a lot of potential ingredients that could be driving honeybee deaths	1
911	542.1	Over the past decade billions of bees have been lost to colony collapse disorder an umbrella term for factors thought to be killing honeybees in droves and threatening the nations food supply	1

911	540.5	Habitat destruction and degradation is one important source	1
911	540.6	Developing the land and cutting down on the natural plant diversity in an area can be a big problem	1
911	540.7	Intensive agriculture which focuses on only a few crops at a time can be a contributor to this issue	1

911	540.9	effects of pesticides on pollinating insects	1
911	540.10	the Environmental Protection Agency released the first in a series of preliminary risk assessments of insecticides thought to be harmful to bees	1
911	540.11	However the assessment does report that research has found a variety of lethal and nonlethal but still negative consequences of pesticide exposure in insect pollinators mainly bees	1
911	540.12	Other factors thought to be affecting pollinators include disease and the influence of invasive species which can compete with native species for resources	1
911	540.13	And climate change is becoming a growing concern as wel	1
911	540.14	Many species have already been affected by the changing climate said Jeremy Kerr	1
911	540.15	imate change can cause some species to emerge at different times of the year than they used to for instance or reproduce at different time	1
911	540.16	can we control our pesticide use so were just a little more careful than we are now	1
911	539.1	Though scientists cited progress in battles against an Asian mite that has killed many an American bee they had words of caution	1
911	539.2	What were seeing with this bee problem is just a loud signal that theres some bad things happening with our agroecosystems	1
911	539.3	But since beekeepers split surviving hives to repopulate stressing bees out	1
911	539.4	he winter loss numbers are more hopeful especially combined with the fact that we have not seen much sign of Colony Collapse Disorder CCD	1
911	538.1	The colony losses of the honeybee  linked to pesticide use parasitic mites and other factors 	1
911	538.2	We should make sure that we steer clear of pesticides that can harm bees and buy only plants that havent been treated with systemic neonicotinoids	1
911	537.1	hanks to what scientists believe is a combination of disease parasites pesticides and other environmental stressors honeybee colonies have experienced significant losses over the past decade or so	1
911	537.2	Pesticides poor nutrition and most importantly parasites	1
911	537.3	The survey found that Nosema a diseasecausing fungus and the Varroa mite a parasite capable of carrying a variety of harmful viruses both remain major problems among honeybee colonies	1
911	537.4	including the effects of pesticides or poor nutrition	1
911	537.5	At the end of the day scientists generally believe that no single factor is causing the demise of honeybees in the United States  and recent efforts to help the insects recover reflect this view	1
911	537.6	Last year for instance the White House released its first National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators a document that stressed the importance of increased research on the effects of pesticides	1
922	564.1	The effect appeared intense if CO2 reached 1200 parts per million  three times the current level which is already much higher than the preindustrial level of carbon dioxide	1
922	564.2	If CO2 reached 1300 parts per million the new report states the global atmospheric temperature would rise 8 degrees Celsius above whatever warming had already been produced from greenhouse gases Its a dramatic effect Schneider told The Washington Post	1
922	564.3	Whats certain is that a spike of 8 degrees C in addition to warming already baked in the cake from greenhouse gas emissions would presumably be catastrophic not only for human civilization but for countless species and ecosystems jolted by the rapid climate change	1
922	564.4	e and his colleagues modeled the formation of such clouds and after two years of computer calculations concluded that the steady rise in atmospheric CO2 could trigger a sudden spike in temperature associated with disappearing stratocumulus cloud	1
922	563.1	 But concentrations began to rise with the early growth of industry and continually climbed throughout the 20th century as documented by the famous Keeling curve based on observations taken at Mauna Loa dating back to the late 1950	1
922	563.2	ncentrations have crossed 400 parts per million on a temporary basis	1
922	563.3	 What the new study suggests is that those days are over  carbon dioxide will never fall below 400 ppm this year nor the next nor the next The reason is that the strong20152016El Nio event has pushed concentrations upward more than usual for a given year  El Nios tend	1
922	563.4	In the longer term a reduction in CO2concentration would require substantial andsustained cuts in anthropogenic emissionsto near zero they write	1
922	562.1	his story has been updated Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have spiked more in the period from February 2015 to February 2016 than in any other comparable period dating back to 1959 according to a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationsEarth System Research Laboratory	1
922	562.2	He also said thatin addition to the stark rise in carbon dioxide levels over the past year researchers have now observed four straight years of increases of more than 2 parts per million in the atmosphere	1
922	562.3	Thats unprecedented Indeed the average annual increase during 2015 of 305parts per million of carbon dioxideat Mauna Loa was also the highest in the record according to NOAA  exceeding the previous record of293 parts per million in 1998 which was also a strong El Nino year	1
922	562.4	The emissions are at a record high therefore the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 is also at a record hig	1
922	562.5	Of late thegrowth ratefor carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere has been around 22 parts per million per year	1
922	561.1	We first reported 400 ppm when all of our Arctic sites reached that value in the spring of 2012 said Pieter Tans lead scientist of NOAAs Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network In 2013 the record at NOAAs Mauna Loa Observatory first crossed the 400 ppm threshold Reaching 400 parts per million as a global average is a significant milestone Why doesaconcentration of 400 ppmmatter Its the level that climate scientists have identified as the beginning of the danger zone Princeton University Prof	1
922	561.2	In 2014 the UN warned of exponential CO2 growth Global carbon dioxide concentration ishigher than ithas been in more than 800000 years	1
922	561.3	The rate of that excavation and emission has been particularly staggering in recent years Humans burning fossil fuels have caused global carbon dioxide concentrations to rise more than 120 parts per million since preindustrial times saidTans Half of that rise has occurred since 1980	1
922	561.4	NOAA data show that the average growth rate of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere from 2012 to 2014 was 225 ppm per year the highest ever recorded over three consecutive years1
922	560.1	Our latest dubious carbon milestone Last year for the first time in recorded history the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide  the primary greenhouse gas that humans are emitting mainly by burning fossil fuels  hit 400 parts per million	1
922	560.2	That may not seem like much and 400 ppm doesnt represent a tipping point for our climate but its still nearly 50 percent higher than it was before industrial times began	1
922	560.3	The United Nations has long said that the world must keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic effects and to do that well likely need to keepcarbondioxide levels below 450 ppm this threshold isnt exact	1
922	560.4	Given the greenhousegas trajectory were on the UNsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changerecently said the worldwould need to cut its carbondioxideequivalent emissions by 40 to 70 percent by midcentury and zero out these emissions by the end of the century For comparisons sake if we dont do anything more to cutcarbondioxide emissions we may reach 450 ppm by 2030	1
922	559.1	For the first time in human history the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached 400 parts per million ppm The arrival at this threshold represents a powerful symbol of the growing human influence on the Earths climate	1
922	559.2	 Manmade emissions of carbon dioxide have increased the atmospheric concentration of CO2 from around 270 to 280 ppm in the late 1700s to todays record high level  a 43 percent increase	1
922	559.3	The evidence is conclusive that the strong growth of global CO2 emissions from the burning of coal oil and natural gas is driving the acceleration	1
922	559.4	Theres no guarantee that wed experience the same levels of warming in the future if CO2 levels stay that high but it doesnt look good writes Time magazines Bryan Walsh Nor will CO2 levels stop at 400 ppmbarring a virtually impossible immediate turn away from fossil fuels CO2 emissions will keep growing globally and CO2 concentrations will keep rising	1
922	558.1	Humans have pushed temperatures higher by burning fossil fuels and clearing forests the report says	1
922	558.2	By the mid21st century the magnitudes of the projected changes are substantially affected by the choice of emissions scenario the IPCC report says In other words how hot the Earth gets will depend on how much carbondioxide we put into the atmosphere	1

924	608.2	What is particularly noteworthy and disturbing about this case is that the evidence that has been made public so strongly points in the direction of a defect in the design of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and a failure by Boeing to adequately instruct and warn its airline customers and their pilots about the changes it made to the flight control system Curt Miner an attorney representing the plaintiff said in an email	1
924	608.3	A week after the crash Boeing warned international airlines that they could experience erroneous warnings from flightcontrol software on its planes related to socalled Angle of Attack AOA sensors which measure which direction the planes nose and make automatic adjustments to prevent the plane from stalling	1

924	596.3	he plane ascended and descended and then ascended again all the while flying at speeds well in excess of normal takeoff procedure	1
924	596.4	There were enough similarities to the crash of the Lion Air jet in Indonesia in October which also involved a Boeing 737 Max 8 that authorities around the world grounded the plane	1
924	596.5	A preliminary report about the causes of the Lion Air crash pointed to erroneous data from a sensor causing the aircrafts new automated stabilizer system to push the jets nose down	1
924	596.6	The pilots struggled to pull the plane up and it crashed into the sea The ministers comments Sunday suggested that a similar series of events may have caused the Ethiopian Airlines crash	1
924	595.1	sia  Rescuers pulled mangled body parts out of the Java Sea on Monday as officials here scrambled to uncover what went wrong on a nearly brandnew Boeing jet operated by Lion Air that crashed likely killing all 189 onboard	1
924	595.2	No clear explanation has emerged about what had caused the crash which occurred shortly after takeoff Skies were clear The Boeing 737 Max8 had been in service for two months and had flown just 800 hours The aircrafts pilot had asked to return to Jakartas airport shortly after takeoff and his request was cleared by air traffic controllers The plane then lost contact with controllers and plunged into the sea from 3000 feet	1
924	595.3	Officials said they have received no confirmation that anyone survived My prediction is that no one has survived because none of the victims have been foundintact said Bambang Suryo Aji the national searchandrescue agencys director of operations	1
924	595.4	Lion Air Flight610 lost contact with air traffic officials and fell about 13 minutes after takeoff officials said People on a nearby tugboat watched the plane descendThe air traffic websites FlightAware and Flightradar24 showed the plane climbing erratically barely reaching above 5000 feet before quickly dropping and disappearing from radar	1
924	595.5	n a news conference Lion Air Groupschief executive Edward Sirait said the plane a new model from Boeing had a technical issue on a previous flight that was resolvedaccording to procedure He did not give details Let the authorities investigate what happened to it he added refusing to speculate on the causeBut I made sure that this plane was released to fly by our engineers	1
924	595.6	The Boeing Company is deeply saddened by the loss of Flight JT 610 We express our concern for those on board and extend heartfelt sympathies to their families and loved ones the company said in a statement	1
924	594.1	Later in the day Trump agreed with his aides that the Federal Aviation Administration as the industry regulator should formally announce the decision to ground the 737 Max planes according to two White House officials	1
924	594.2	Were going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and the planes associated with that line Trump announced catching some industry officials by surprise	1
924	594.3	As governments in China Australia the European Union and elsewhere were moving to ground the 737 Max plane on Monday and Tuesday Trump and his administration were in a holding pattern	1
924	594.4	On Tuesday as a growing number of countries were grounding the planes	1
924	594.5	On Tuesday night officials said Trump was given satellite data that indicated the same 737 Max automation system believed to be responsible for a crash in Indonesia last year that killed more than 180 people may have played a role in Sundays accident	1
924	594.6	Boeing which as late as Tuesday said publicly it saw no reason to ground the planes announced soon after Trump made his move that it had recommended the grounding We are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution Muilenburg said in a statement We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again	1
924	594.7	They are working very very hard right now And hopefully they will very quickly come up with the answer But until they do the planes are grounded	1
924	593.1	In its most detailed briefing yet Boeing executives took a conciliatory tone about the loss of life from two deadly crashes involving the 737 Max	1
924	593.2	Safety concerns over the 737 Max emerged around the world after March 10 when a Boeing Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff killing 157 It came just months after another Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia under similar circumstances killing 189 The FAA concluded based on satellite data and evidence from the wreckage that the two accidents had enough in common that global fleets of the Max 8 should be grounded	1
924	593.3	The statement echoed one from chief executive Dennis Muilenburg in the days after the Lion Air Max 8 crash in Indonesia in October	1
924	593.4	Pilots were concerned that they did not have enough information about how to override MCAS	1
924	593.5	The second test came two days after a second Max 8 jet crashed this time in Ethiopia	1
924	593.6	The possibility that MCAS in combination with faulty data fed in through external sensors could cause pilots to lose control at a critical moment has shaken the confidence of global regulators	1
924	592.1	thiopia  A new piece of evidence found by investigators on the ground here suggests the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed Sunday may have had a problem with a new flightcontrol system also suspected in the crash of a Lion Air flight in October	1
924	592.2	It is the second piece of information suggesting similarities between the two crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets	1
924	592.3	Cox formerly the top safety official for the Air Line Pilots Association said he was privately briefed on the evidence Thursday by people familiar with the investigation All we can say definitely is that the trim was in a position similar to the position found on the Lion Air airplane and it would cause the nose to go down he said	1
924	592.4	Daniel K Elwell acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration cited newly refined satellite tracking data and evidence recovered from the wreckage site as factors in his decision to ground the jets Wednesda	1
924	592.5	That data also showed similarities to the Lion Air flight Cox said he believes the jackscrew is the new evidence Elwell was citing	1
924	592.6	the plane crashed in a farm field about 40 miles from Addis Ababa killing all 157 passengers and crew members	1
924	592.7	In a preliminary investigation the crash of a Lion Air Max 8 plane into the Java Sea on Oct 29 was attributed to a faulty sensor causing an automated system to push the nose of the plane down	1
924	592.8	The possibility that the same scenario occurred in Ethiopia has prompted precautionary groundings of the plane all over the world	1
924	592.9	In all more than 300 people have died in the two crashes involving the Max 8 jet Preliminary flight data showed the Ethiopian Airlines plane in trouble almost immediately and struggling to gain altitude in the high thin air above the Addis Ababa airpor	1
924	592.10	In the case of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia faulty information from the angleofattack sensor convinced the automated system that the plane was going to stall and pushed its nose down while the pilots wrestled to pull the aircraft up	1
924	592.11	The result was an erratic flight path in which the plane descended and ascended repeatedly before plunging into the Java Sea killing all 189 passengers and crew aboard	1
924	592.12	The data from the recorders in Ethiopia could help determine whether the potential links between the two crashes are real and related to this automated feature on the craft  hundreds of which were flown around the world until China decided to ground them Monday and other countries followed suit	1
924	591.1	Airlines and regulators in Ethiopia China and other countries meanwhile said they were temporarily grounding Boeings newest version of the 737 the Max 8 after the plane was involved in its second fatal crash in less than five months	1
924	591.2	It also outlined previous actions the FAA had taken related to the crash of a Lion Air flight Oct 29 That plane also was a Max 8	1
924	591.3	The Ethiopian government declared a national day of mourning Monday as the recovery efforts continued Ethiopian Airlines said the planes flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered The hope is that the instruments will offer critical details about what happened in the minutes before the Nairobibound flight crashed At this stage we cannot rule out anything Tewolde GebreMariam chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines told reporters at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa the BBC reported	1
924	591.4	The crash drew immediate comparisons to the October crash of Lion Air Flight 610 All 189 passengers and crew aboard were killed when that jet crashed into the Java Sea Like the Ethiopian flight the Lion Air plane went down shortly after takeoff Lion Air is a privately run Indonesian carrier	1
924	591.5	External reports are drawing similarities between this accident and the Lion Air Flight 610 accident on October 29 2018	1
924	591.6	Chinas Civil Aviation Administration said in a statement early Monday that it had asked domestic airlines to temporarily ground all Max 8 jets before 6 pm It was the first time China has taken the lead in ordering a model grounded	1
924	591.7	Some countries and carriers moved to ground their Max 8 jets Monday Ethiopian Airlines said its fleet of the planes would be grounded as an extra safety precaution	1
924	591.8	Indonesias director general of civil aviation Polana B Pramesti said that the move was to ensure flight safety and that the planes would be inspected	1
924	591.9	In Vietnam meanwhile the Civil Aviation Authority said it would not license the use of the Max plane in the country pending the results of investigations and remedial measures While there are no Max 8 aircraft in use in Vietnam budget airline VietJet Air ordered 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in February including 20 of the Max 8 version	1
924	591.10	The national airlines of Mexico and Argentina announced Monday night that they had suspended the operation of their Max 8 planes Reuters reported	1
924	591.11	Singapore Morocco and Mongolia also suspended operation of Max 8 planes news agencies reported	1
924	591.12	It was the Oct 29 Lion Air crash that first raised concerns about the Max 8 According to the investigation into that crash pilots wrestled with the plane because a faulty sensor and automatic feature sent its nose pointing down while the pilots struggled to lift the plane up	1
924	591.13	hey requested permission to return to the airport shortly before plunging into the Java Sea	1
924	591.14	The pilot asked to return to Addis Ababa because he was experiencing difficulties	1
924	591.15	The Chinese Civil Aviation Administration in issuing its order to ground the jets cited similarities between the two crashes The CCAA said that all planes of that model would be grounded until further notice under Chinese policies allowing zero tolerance for safety hazards and risks	1

924	588.2	Already China  the companys most important foreign market  has grounded the 737 Max 8	1
924	588.3	But the crash which killed all 157 people on board puts the spotlight on Boeing which already faced scrutiny for the October crash of a 737 Max 8 in Indonesia and concerns that a software update to the 737 could make it hard for pilots to override a malfunctioning autopilot system when it steers the plane into a nosedive	1
924	588.4	While investigators descended on the crash site trying to determine what happened China Indonesia Brazil Singapore and Ethiopia grounded the planes Australia  a major longdistance travel destination  barred them from its airspace and Britain announced a similar ban on Tuesday	1
924	588.5	In October an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta Indonesia killing all 189 passengers and crew members Investigators blamed a faulty sensor and automatic feature for pointing its nose down while pilots struggled to lift the plane up	1
924	588.6	Pilots of the Lion Air 737 battled the computerized control system in an effort to arrest the planes dive but each time the system reasserted itself and the plane hit the water at 450 miles an hour according to Indonesias initial investigation report	1
924	588.7	Criticism against Boeing stirred when the company disclosed after the Lion Air disaster that a new autopilot program known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS could disable a feature that pilots would use to take control of a plane The updated software was meant to make the plane safer by accounting for minor design changes to its engines But pilots said a Boeing decision not to include the new system in pilot training left them in the dark about how to respond in an emergency	1

924	587.3	Pilot groups in the US were incensed that Boeing had built the system into its new jets without detailing it in training courses raising concerns that pilots might not know how to take control at a crucial moment	1
924	587.4	Those criticisms reached a fever pitch earlier this month when another Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed in Ethiopia under similar circumstances	1
924	587.5	On March 13 the FAA grounded all 737 MAX jets in the US Agency officials said that airplane tracking data and new evidence from the wreckage of the Ethiopia crash showed similarities to the crash in Indonesia leading the agency to ground both the 737 Max 8 and the Max 9 another aircraft in the series	1
924	587.6	Air Canada announced last week it would remove all 24 MAX aircraft from its flight schedules through at least July 1	1
924	586.1	Today aviation experts say that the angleofattack sensor on Boeing jets will get fresh scrutiny after two Boeing 737 Max airplanes crashed in Ethiopia last week and in Indonesia in October Accident investigators have raised concerns about the role of the sensor  a device used on virtually every commercial flight  in the October crash of Lion Air Flight 610	1

924	574.2	The recently acquired aircraft was the same Boeing 737 Max8 model that was involved in a crash in Indonesia in October The preliminary investigation into the October crash focused on a malfunctioning sensor and computer system that pushed down the planes nose Data from the Ethiopian Airlines crash appears to show a similar erratic flight path with the plane first ascending then descending then ascending sharply before it fell from the sky	1
924	574.3	After the October crash of Lion Air Flight610 in Indonesia the Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency notice that an erroneous sensor input could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane leading to possible impact with terrain	1
924	574.4	In that crash a malfunctioning sensor convinced the airplanes software that the flight was stalling and corrected by pointing the nose down	1
924	574.5	However on this flight a minute and a half after its takeoff the plane inexplicably began to descend  for nearly a minute  before climbing again During that time the planes speed kept increasing to what is far above normal for that phase of a takeoff The plane underwent a sharp pull up  600 feet in just 10 seconds  and was flying at 380 nautical miles per hour when about 270 would be closer to normal Three minutes later it crashed	1

924	571.5	Reputational crisis In its order grounding the planes Wednesday the FAA said it had received information from the Ethiopian Airlines wreckage concerning the aircrafts configuration just after takeoff that taken together with newly refined data from satellitebased tracking of the aircrafts flight path indicates some similarities between what happened with that flight and the Lion Air flight in Indonesia	1

924	570.2	Using satellite tracking data from a private firm US and Canadian officials identified parallels between the flight that crashed outside Addis Ababa and the Lion Air flight in Indonesia leading to the FAAs decision Wednesday to ground both the 737 Max 8 and the Max 9 another aircraft in the series	1

924	568.2	A top Chinese regulator said his agency made its decision because the FAA and Boeing had not provided China with satisfactory answers about the airplanes software and safety issues after the first 737 Max crash  of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia that killed all 189 passengers and crew	1
924	568.3	But within hours European officials made a different determination prompted in part by new satellite information suggesting similarities between the crash on Sunday and the Lion Air flight that went down October	1
924	567.1	Late Wednesday morning Canadas transportation minister announced that new satellite tracking data showed enough similarities between the October incident and the March10 crash to ground the aircraft following numerous other countries that had already made the decision	1

924	567.5	Finally at 230 pm Wednesday word came from President Trump that the United States would also bar the planes from flying	1
924	567.6	Aviation experts said the satellite data showed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 had ascended and descended multiple times after takeoff echoing the behavior of the plane in the Oct29 Lion Air flight that crashed into the Java Sea after sensor and automation malfunctions according to the preliminary investigation	1
924	567.7	Some experts and analysts say they are confident that the decision to ground the Boeing 737 Max was made by experts at the FAA based on the new evidence which included a device found in the wreckage that indicated the jet was configured to dive	1
924	567.8	They wont be back on the runways until we are absolutely 100percent satisfied that they are safe	1
924	566.1	may be weeks or months until we know why Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed minutes after takeoff Sunday killing all 157 passengers and crew on board	1
924	566.2	But the crash is drawing comparisons to another air disaster the Oct 29 wreck of Lion Air Flight 610 which went down off the coast of Indonesia killing all 189 people on board	1

924	566.4	Thus far there is no indication that bad weather was involved Read the preliminary report on the Lion Air Flight 610 crash in Indonesia Both flights struggled to gain altitude When Lion Air Flight 610 left Jakarta it was supposed to reach a cruising altitude of 27000 feet according to the preliminary report But the aircraft struggled to gain altitude limiting the crews room to gain control before the plane plummeted into the ocean at a reported 450 mph	1
924	566.5	preliminary data collected by Flightradar24 suggests that the aircraft struggled to climb at a steady speed In both cases pilots alerted air traffic control that there was something wrong and asked to return to the airport Neither made it back Both flights ascended and descended several times before nosediving What is most striking about the Lion Air planes 12minute journey is that the plane pitched downward more than two dozen times before its final plunge	1
924	566.6	the aircraft also appeared to ascend and descend while accelerating according to preliminary data from Flightradar24	1
924	566.7	The study found that the Lion Air aircrafts flight maintenance log showed several problems with the plane each day between Oct 26 and Oct 29 including errors involving air speed and altitude information displays The preliminary report also found that some of the aircrafts equipment was checked before its final flight but that the aircrafts angle of attack sensor was not	1
924	566.8	s the aircraft made its initial ascent the sensor insisted that the nose of the plane was too high for the planes airspeed creating the risk of a stall and an automatic feature kicked in sending the nose downward as the pilots struggled to force it back up	1
924	566.9	With Ethiopian crash a second new Boeing 737 Max 8 jet goes down Ethiopian Airlines flight bound for Nairobi crashes all 157 on board killed	1

924	565.2	The company is grappling with the fallout of an Oct 29 disaster in which a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Indonesian budget airline Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta killing all 189 people on board	1
924	565.3	When Boeing repositioned the engines on the Max and made them more powerful it introduced a system called MCAS Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System that was intended to make the airplane behave identical to its predecessor the 737 Next Generation Given that intention Boeing told the airlines about MCAS but pilots say it wasnt included in their training	1
924	565.4	The computer cant reconcile the difference or permit the copilot to fly normally from the right seat when there is a problem with the pilots control display	1

947	645.2	It is an infrared telescope with a 65meterwide segmented mirror and it has to be kept cold to gather light emitted in the early universe when stars were just starting to form galaxies	1
947	644.1	The Webb which includes major contributions from the Canadian and European space agencies has long been seen as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope	1
947	644.2	The Webb is quite different from the Hubble starting with the fact that its much bigger The Hubble has a 24meter mirror but the Webb has 18 hexagonal mirrors that collectively are 65 meters  more than 21 feet  in diameter It can collect seven times as much starlight	1
947	644.3	The new telescope can observe the universe in infrared wavelengths of light that are inaccessible to the Hubble In deep space shaded from the sun the Webb is designed to operate under extremely cold conditions	1
947	644.4	The Hubble has looked at the Trappist system and already has determined that the planets are probably rocky rather than gaseous like Jupiter or Saturn But the Webb has sophistication the Hubble lacks The Webb can detect the clear signatures of atmospheres containing water ozone oxygen methane and other molecules That could provide compelling evidence of a habitable planet	1
947	644.5	If it works the James Webb Space Telescope will collect the oldest light in the universe emitted soon after the big bang when the first stars lit up and the first galaxies began to form It will study black holes lurking at the center of galaxies It will scrutinize the light from planets around distant stars and look for atmospheres youd expect to see on worlds rioting with life	1
947	643.1	As Hubble nears the end of its life its much more capable successor the James Webb Space Telescope	1
947	643.2	Hubble which is the size of a school bus supplies data for more than onefifth of all scholarly astronomy papers Webb which will be the size of a tennis court will advance knowledge about this stupendous improbability How did material complexity then singlecell life then animals and consciousness emerge from chaos	1
947	643.3	Webb will not shed light on two interesting questions How many universes are there Is everything the result of a meaningless cosmic sneeze or of an intentional First Cause	1
947	642.1	Astronomers are hoping that the Webb will be able to collect light that is very far away from us and is moving still farther away	1
947	642.2	But as the sources of light become fainter and farther away you need a big telescope like the James Webb	1
947	642.3	Named for a former NASA director the 21footdiameter Webb telescope will be 100 times as powerful as the Hubble Space Telescope which was launched in 1990	1
947	642.4	Webbs mirrors are covered in a thin layer of gold that absorbs blue light but reflects yellow and red visible light and its cameras will detect infrared light and a small part of the visible spectrum	1
947	642.5	As objects move away from us the wavelength of their light shifts from visible light to infrared light Thats why the Webbs infrared cameras will be able to see things that are both far away and moving away from us	1
947	642.6	The cameras will also probe the atmospheres of planets that revolve around nearby stars known as exoplanets for the chemical signatures of life water oxygen and maybe even pollution from alien civilizations	1
947	642.7	The Webb will be both bigger and located in a darker part of space than Hubble enabling it to capture images from the faintest galaxies Four infrared cameras will capture light that is moving away from us very quickly and that has shifted from the visible to the infrared spectrum described as redshifted The advantage of using infrared light is that it is not blocked by clouds of gas and dust that may lie between the telescope and the light	1
947	642.8	Back in the 1990s NASA sent shuttle astronauts to repair Hubbles mirror during a dangerous operation that required five days of spacewalks But thats not an option for the Webb It will be parked too far away	1
947	642.9	Still the Webb is NASAs most expensive science mission	1
947	642.10	Seager and other scientists can point the Hubble at exoplanets but they dont get much time to use it because the entire telescope heats up and cools down as it passes from day to night	1
947	642.11	The Webb telescope represents a big step forward according to Seager because it wont be bothered by light or radiation from the sun and the Earth and therefore will be able to see moredistant objects	1
947	642.12	A fivelayer sun shield and distance from the Earth will protect the telescope	1
947	641.1	With the Hubble Space Telescope the soontolaunch James Webb Space Telescope and groundbased observatories astronomers can also analyze the light that passes through the atmospheres of the planets to figure out what molecules those atmospheres contain Butwe wont be able to directly image the solar system with current technology Gillon said	1

950	710.3	Prescription opioids are killing Americans at more than five times the rate that heroin is according to the most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	1
950	710.4	But the very real heroin epidemic is framed by an even more dramatic increase since the beginning of the century in overdoses from pharmaceutical drugs known as opioids	1
950	710.5	Theyre also sold illicitly on the street or crushed and laced into heroin There have been numerous efforts by law enforcement agencies to crack down on pill mills that dispense massive amounts of the pharmaceuticals as well as regulations aimed at preventing users from doctor shopping to find someone who will write a prescription	1

953	761.4	They would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these soontobeoperational air bases	1

953	757.1	hina has the right to deploy necessary defense facilities as appropriate on its own territory The HQ9s on the Spratlys would be a significant improvement to the island chains defenses	1
953	756.1	The presence of the USS William P Lawrence an Arleigh Burkeclass guidedmissile destroyer prompted the Chinese military to scramble threefighter jets that monitored the destroyer along with three Chinese ships until the American vesselleft the area	1
953	756.2	According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry the US destroyerentered the area without Chinas permission The American naval vessel threatened Chinas sovereignty security and interests and it harmed the safety of the people and facilities in the island damaging regional stability Lu Kang a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said in a regularly scheduled news conference	1
953	755.1	China is now faced with a dilemma It can signal its displeasure at the ruling by extending that program and militarizing the islands it controls risking confrontation and even conflict with emboldened Asian neighbors and the United States	1
953	755.2	The US Navy has already conducted several freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea sending warships within 12 nautical miles of islands reefs and rocks controlled by China and other claimants	1

953	754.3	 The Chinese could have deployed other systems that were less highprofile than the HQ9 whichis just short of the deployment of landbased antiship cruise missiles something Ashdown believes would be an extremely aggressivemove on Chinas behal	1
953	753.1	The US and India are deepening military ties	1
953	752.1	China also deployed attack submarines to the Indian Ocean for the first time in 2014 ostensibly to support counterpiracy operations but more realistically to gain familiarity with the region and to demonstrate an emerging capability according to the Pentagons annual report on China military operations released last year	1

953	750.2	hina says its construction program in the South China Sea is mainly for civilian use adding that it is only building limited and necessary defensive facilities on what it considers to be its sovereign territory	1
953	750.3	It is certainly possible to claim a civilian purpose and China will Poling wrote	1
953	750.4	But just like you dont need a 3000meter runway to land civilian planes you dont need a highfrequency radar assuming that is what this is to give early warning of commercial traffic Radar is inherently dualuse but just like its other dualuse infrastructure in the Spratlys the real value is military More limited radar like China has at every other feature in the Spratlys is more than sufficient to monitor and ensure the safety of civilian traffic near the features China points to lighthouses it has constructed on two islands as well as meteorological stations and shelter and rescue facilities to highlight the civilian nature of its construction program	1
953	750.5	The Chinese side is entitled to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests	1
953	750.6	China conducts construction on relevant islands and reefs mainly for civilian purposes of providing better public services and goods for the international community Chinas deployment of limited defense facilities on its own territory is its exercise of selfdefense right to which a sovereign state is entitled under international law	1
953	750.7	t has nothing to do with militarization	1
953	749.1	It may be tougher though to convince Chinas neighbors or the United States that newly furnished islands and atolls are about anything other than sovereignty claims The main purpose is strategic  the idea that these are for civilian use is a pretext nobody believes it Storey said	1
953	748.1	 China said Tuesday that it plans to extend its global military reach to safeguard its economic interests while defending its territorial claims at sea against provocative actions by neighbors and meddling by the United States	1
953	748.2	It asserts a confidence backed by growing capability on land and increasingly at sea he said While it calls for balancing Chinas territorial rights with stability there should be little doubt on the part of its neighbors that China is building a maritime force to assert the former	1

953	748.7	Yang said SinoUS relations are generally good and noted that both militaries have signed agreements to govern air and maritime encounters and prevent crises But the policy paper expressed concern about the United States rebalancing strategy which has led China to enhance its military presence and strengthen military alliances in the AsiaPacific region and worry about more assertive military and security policies in Japan	1
953	748.8	On Tuesday state media reported that China had held a groundbreaking ceremony for the building of two lighthouses on the disputed Spratly Islands a move that Hua said was meant to fulfill the nations international obligations but that is unlikely to ease concerns about Beijings expanding influence	1
953	747.1	The Philippines says similar warnings have been delivered to its military aircraft in the past three months suggesting that China is trying to exclude foreign military planes from the are1
953	747.2	Although China glosses over the military purpose of those artificial islands they are likely primarily intended to change the power balance in the South China Sea visavis the US Navy which for now is the dominant force in the area said Yanmei Xie senior China analyst at the International Crisis Group	1
953	747.3	China could use the completed installations to scramble fighter jets to intercept tail and attempt to evict incoming military aircraft Xie noted	1
953	747.4	Although China has acknowledged that the islands will have military uses Hong insisted that the main purpose of the construction work was to provide service for search and rescue at sea fishing security disaster prevention and relief and meteorological monitoring among other things	1
953	746.1	hina has also stated its intent to further construct facilities including for the purpose of military defense	1
953	746.2	He said that would allow the Peoples Liberation Army air force to have overlapping air control over the South China Sea and not just from one airfield but from three	1
953	746.3	Along with radars and surfacetoair missiles this will give China the capability to enforce an air defense identification zone and hold the waters of the South China Sea at risk should it choose to do so McCain continued	1
953	745.1	China in turn accuses the United States of militarizing the region as part of President Obamas strategic rebalance to Asia It has also pointed to a 2011 deal to station Marines in Darwin Australia and a recent announcement allowing US troops access to five bases in the Philippines	1
953	745.2	Reinforcing a military alliance is a sign of Cold War thinking and it runs against the trend of this era  peace development cooperation and winwin the Ministry of National Defense told China Daily in response to the latest news	1
953	745.3	China says those deployments are only for defensive purposes on its sovereign territory	1

953	744.2	This week the US Navy said it had dispatched an aircraft carrier and several other ships to the South China Sea on what was described as a routine patrol	1

953	743.2	nd China in turn increased its surveillance of the waters badgering Philippine vessels in places where they had previously gone unbothered	1
953	743.3	The Philippines inhabits nine of the 53 such rocks or islands that it considers its own citing a UN maritime treaty The Vietnamese have claimed 22 though without eliciting quite the same scorn from Filipinos as China	1
953	742.1	The buildup is all part of Chinas claim to sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea  claims that are easier to make over waters contiguous to sovereign pieces of land	1

954	815.3	He broke a 20year stalemate with Eritrea Abiys first overture was to his former mentorscumnemesis the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front TPLF	1
954	815.4	biys ability to break a 20year stalemate between Ethiopia and Eritrea did lend credence to the idea that the source of conflict in the Horn of Africa had been the inability of leaders to show goodwill a positive attitude and trust  rather than the view that attributes conflict to incompatible values and interests	1

964	874.2	Paregol who had fallen sick weeks earlier died Nov 18	1
964	874.3	The next day UMd leaders acknowledged that adenovirus was present on campus It appears that at just about every turn leaders withheld information instead of being open and honest with the student body Hogan wrote in the letter There should never be a question as to whether the campus community will receive timely and accurate information especially when it is an urgent matter of public health and safety	1
964	874.4	The universitys response to the viral outbreak  and persistent problems with mold in residence halls  has drawn fresh attention since The Washington Post reported in May that university officials waited 18 days to alert the campus to the presence of adenovirus on campus even as students were falling ill The virus sickened more than 40 students the university said with 15 treated at hospitals	1

964	868.4	Paregols death occurred just months after the campus mourned another student Jordan McNair a 19yearold football player who collapsed of heatstroke during a team workout If he had been immersed in cold water and treated right away he might have survived experts have said Instead more than an hour passed before paramedics were called and by the time the teenager arrived at a hospital his temperature was 106 degrees That death alone should have been enough for the university to realize and never forget that delayed actions can be deadly	1
