911	546	911.2	We know there are multiple things that are hurting the bees
911	546	911.3	Evans was an early proponent of mapping and studying the genome of honeybees and also has been working on sequencing the genome of the Varroa mite in order to develop novel control methods for this pest which is harmful to honeybees
911	544	911.4	The studies in the journal Science have been eagerly anticipated because ofconcerns about the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators but the results were not as clearcut as experts had hoped
911	544	911.5	n another complication when the researchers in Europe sampled the nests of bumble bees and solitary bees for pesticide residues they found contamination with one type of neonicotinoid not used in the study This was surprising because there is a moratorium on the use of the pesticides to treat seeds of flowering plants in the European Union This supports previously proposed hypotheses that neonicotinoids which are water soluble might persist in the soil and that the bees were picking up chemicals applied before the ban
911	544	911.6	n the Canadian study scientists found that bees were exposed to 26 different pesticides Neonicotinoids were present far below dangerous levels but the exposure continued for months Surprisingly the bulk of contaminated pollen didnt come from crops treated with the pesticide but from wildflowers nearby That adds to the evidence that neonicotinoids might move through the soil and get picked up by other plants
911	544	911.7	The new studies suggesting that neonicotinoids seem to persist in the soil may help explain how bees which do not forage on windpollinated corn could still be exposed near fields of treated corn seeds In terms of how neonicotinoids effect bees in the field many questions remain
911	543	911.8	And still moreresearch has foundthat neonicotinoidscould induceat least some of the symptoms of CCD although these findingshave proved to be controversial
911	543	911.9	n short there are a lot of potential ingredients that could be driving honeybee deaths
911	540	911.10	can we control our pesticide use so were just a little more careful than we are now
911	539	911.11	But since beekeepers split surviving hives to repopulate stressing bees out
911	539	911.12	he winter loss numbers are more hopeful especially combined with the fact that we have not seen much sign of Colony Collapse Disorder CCD
911	538	911.13	We should make sure that we steer clear of pesticides that can harm bees and buy only plants that havent been treated with systemic neonicotinoids
911	537	911.14	At the end of the day scientists generally believe that no single factor is causing the demise of honeybees in the United States  and recent efforts to help the insects recover reflect this view
911	537	911.15	ast year for instance the White House released its first National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators a document that stressed the importance of increased research on the effects of pesticides
922	564	922.1	f CO2 reached 1300 parts per million the new report states the global atmospheric temperature would rise 8 degrees Celsius above whatever warming had already been produced from greenhouse gases Its a dramatic effect Schneider told The Washington Pos
922	563	922.2	What the new study suggests is that those days are over  carbon dioxide will never fall below 400 ppm this year nor the next nor the next The reason is that the strong20152016El Nio event has pushed concentrations upward more than usual for a given year  El Nios ten
922	563	922.3	ut concentrations began to rise with the early growth of industry and continually climbed throughout the 20th century as documented by the famous Keeling curve based on observations taken at Mauna Loa dating back to the late 1950
922	562	922.4	Thats unprecedented Indeed the average annual increase during 2015 of 305parts per million of carbon dioxideat Mauna Loa was also the highest in the record according to NOAA  exceeding the previous record of293 parts per million in 1998 which was also a strong El Nino year
922	562	922.5	is story has been updated Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have spiked more in the period from February 2015 to February 2016 than in any other comparable period dating back to 1959 according to a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationsEarth System Research Laboratory
922	560	922.6	hat may not seem like much and 400 ppm doesnt represent a tipping point for our climate but its still nearly 50 percent higher than it was before industrial times began
922	560	922.7	Given the greenhousegas trajectory were on the UNsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changerecently said the worldwould need to cut its carbondioxideequivalent emissions by 40 to 70 percent by midcentury and zero out these emissions by the end of the century For comparisons sake if we dont do anything more to cutcarbondioxide emissions we may reach 450 ppm by 2030
922	557	922.8	The prevailing headline is that the panel is more certain than ever that most of the warming observed in recent decades is humancaused Its level of certainty has increased from at least 90 percent in 2007 to at least 95 percent in the new report
922	556	922.9	Sea level ranged between five and 40 meters 16 to 131 feet higher than today
922	556	922.10	One final point Humanity is all but certain to zoom past 400 parts per million
922	555	922.11	When trees in the Northern Hemisphere bloom in the spring and summer they absorb some of that carbon When the leaves wilt in the winter carbon returns to the air and readings spike
922	554	922.12	Estimates from the 1700s show atmospheric carbon dioxide at about 270 parts per million  about 40 percent lower than today
922	553	922.13	If the oceans and the biosphere cannot absorb as much carbon the effect on the atmosphere could be much worse said Oksana Tarasova a scientist and chief of the WMOs Global Atmospheric Watch program which collects data from 125 monitoring stations worldwide
922	553	922.14	he symbolically important threshold of 400 parts per million  described by scientists as the level at which more dramatic climactic impacts become likely  will probably be crossed in the next two years the report said Its the level that climate scientists have identified as the beginning of the danger zone said Michael Oppenheimer a Princeton University professor of geosciences who was not involved in the WMO report
922	550	922.15	However none ofthe scenarios  low or high emissions  take into account things that are not wellunderstood such as the effect of melting permafrost which in itself has the ability to inject large amounts of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere

924	598	924.8	At the news conference Wednesday Utomo said the plane on both the doomed flight and the previous flight from Bali to Jakarta had experienced a stick shaker  a warning that showed that the plane was going to stall he said The committee report said differing data between the sensors appeared rectified by cleaning an electrical plug the night before the crash and a test on the ground found the problem had been solved But it was not the report concludes because when the plane took off shortly after 6 am the following morning the two flightspeed sensors did not agree on the aircrafts speed

924	594	924.10	Boeing which as late as Tuesday said publicly it saw no reason to ground the planes
924	593	924.11	Pilots were concerned that they did not have enough information about how to override MCAS

924	583	924.19	The new flightcontrol systems automatically put the nose down to keep the plane from stalling Mary Schiavo an airline lawyer and former inspector general of the US Transportation Department said in an email But the pilots dont know this and are not trained on this So the pilots keep putting the nose up and the plane keeps putting the nose down
924	583	924.20	This was clearly a sign that the safety culture at Boeing was missing on a cylinder or two he said
