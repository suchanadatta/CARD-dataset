The United States has lots of statues for military heroes, but the nation is about to get its first national monument honoring four-legged soldiers. The U.S. Working Dogs Team National Monument will be shown for the first time in California in January, and it will honor every dog that has served in combat since World War II. The monument was the idea of John Burnam, a retired military dog handler who has written books about dogs he served with in the military. The bronze monument features four breeds of dogs, all used in war: Doberman, German shepherd, Labrador retriever and Belgian Malinois (pronounced mal-in-wa). The dogs surround a handler who stands nine feet tall and weighs 1,500 pounds. The dogs are each about five feet tall. A floral version of the monument will be a float in the Tournament of Roses Parade. The bronze statue will be displayed in California before going to its permanent home in Texas.	116	"[{""start"": 257, ""end"": 326, ""text"": ""it will honor every dog that has served in combat since World War II."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 257, ""end"": 326, ""text"": ""it will honor every dog that has served in combat since World War II."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	127	2023-03-20T09:19:05.267803Z	2023-03-20T09:19:05.267890Z	963.438
A dog named Dux, part of a law enforcement K-9 unit in Virginia, is recovering after being shot by a man who fled authorities following a traffic stop. Dux underwent surgery and is recovering, according to an online social media post from the Spotsylvania Sheriff's Office. Officials said Dux was “resting comfortably” after surgery. The man who authorities say shot the dog — Joseph Conway — was apprehended, they said, although they did not immediately release details as to where he was caught. Authorities said the incident started about 9:10 p.m. Sunday in Fredericksburg, when police stopped a vehicle for a traffic infraction. The driver was wanted on several felony warrants and was taken into custody without incident. But Conway, who was a passenger in the vehicle, got out. He then got into a “physical altercation” with one of the sheriff’s deputies before he fled on foot, authorities said. As he was being pursued by deputies and a K-9, authorities said, Conway “pulled a pistol from his clothing” and “fired several rounds” at the deputies and the dog. He struck the dog at least once, officials said. The dog was taken to a veterinary hospital. Sheriff’s deputies fired at Conway. None of the deputies were injured. It was not known whether Conway was struck in the gunfire exchange. Conway faces arrest warrants on several charges, including attempted capital murder of law enforcement and possession of a firearm by a felon.	115	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 150, ""text"": ""named Dux, part of a law enforcement K-9 unit in Virginia, is recovering after being shot by a man who fled authorities following a traffic stop"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 334, ""end"": 392, ""text"": ""The man who authorities say shot the dog — Joseph Conway —"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 904, ""end"": 1116, ""text"": ""As he was being pursued by deputies and a K-9, authorities said, Conway “pulled a pistol from his clothing” and “fired several rounds” at the deputies and the dog.

On May 4 2013, Marine Raider Cpl. David Sonka and his “multi-purpose canine,” a Belgian Malinois named Flex, were killed in Farah province, Afghanistan. Sonka was a few months into his second enlistment when an Afghan soldier turned his weapon on Sonka and his dog in an insider attack. Another Marine was also killed — Staff Sgt. Eric Christian. This coming Monday the Marine Corps will honor Sonka when Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) posthumously dedicates its multi-purpose canine kennel in his name aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, N.C., according to a Friday news release. The Sept. 7 ceremony will also feature the unveiling of a full-size bronze statue of a multi-purpose canine, according to Marine spokesman Capt. Barry Morris. In attendance will be Sonka’s family as well as the commanding general of Marine Special Operations Command, Maj. Gen. Joseph Osterman. Sonka, a native of Aurora, Colo., started in the Marines as military policeman where he spent his first enlistment stationed at Marine Corps base 29 Palms, Calif., as a dog handler. During his initial tenure in the service he deployed once to Afghanistan, according to a biography provided by the Marine Corps. In 2012, Sonka tried out for Marine special operations where he successfully completed the Marine Special Operations Training Course and two phases of the Multi-Purpose Canine Course. He then deployed shortly after to Farah Province as a Multi-Purpose Canine Handler attached to 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion. To Marine Sgt. Marc Galvis, a Marine who attended military police school with Sonka at Fort Leonard Wood. Mo., the future special operation Marine and multi-purpose canine handler always stood out to him as an overachiever. “He was always talking about being a K-9 handler,” Galvis said. “We had to write an essay about why we wanted to be one and Sonka’s just blew the instructors away.” Becoming a dog handler in the Marine Corps is extremely competitive Galvis explained, and where many struggled, Sonka excelled. Sonka was 23 when he was killed, and following his death his hometown named one their police department’s working dogs after Flex.  Sonka is the recipient of the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement medal, the Good Conduct Medal and a Combat Action Ribbon. While many military units operate with working dogs, the Marine Special Operations multi-purpose canines are unique in the sense that they are able to perform a number of different tasks as opposed to just having one defined role such as bomb sniffing. A multi-purpose canine attached to a Marine Special Operations Team can not only detect buried explosives but is also capable of tracking and pursuing the enemy as well as providing additional protection to the team the dog is assigned to. According to recent report published by the Marine Corps, the multi-purpose canines are transitioning to a more maritime role following the draw down in Afghanistan, with their handlers training with them on fast roping from helicopters and swimming. Flex isn’t the first multipurpose canine to die while operating with Marine special operation units. Multi-purpose canine Tosca along with his handler Sgt. Christopher Wrinkle died on July 31, 2011, when their barracks caught fire in Afghanistan.	114	"[{""start"": 3, ""end"": 285, ""text"": ""y 4 2013, Marine Raider Cpl.

Authorities in Spotsylvania County, Va., said Monday they are looking for a man who shot at sheriff deputies and a K-9. The dog, named Dux, was wounded. The incident started about 9:10 p.m. Sunday in Fredericksburg when police said they stopped a vehicle for a minor traffic infraction. The driver was wanted on several felony warrants and was taken into custody without incident. But the passenger in the vehicle — later identified as Joseph Conway, 34, of King George County — got out and got involved in a “physical altercation” with one of the deputies. Conway then fled on foot. As he was being pursued by sheriff deputies and a K-9, authorities said Conway “pulled a pistol from his clothing” and “fired several rounds” at the deputies and the dog. He struck the dog at least once, officials said. The dog was taken to an area veterinary hospital. Sheriff deputies fired at Conway. None of the deputies were injured. It was not known if Conway was struck in the gunfire exchange. Conway is believed armed and dangerous. Conway faces arrest warrants for several charges, including attempted capital murder of law enforcement and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Anyone with information is asked to call 911.	106	"[{""start"": 584, ""end"": 852, ""text"": ""As he was being pursued by sheriff deputies and a K-9, authorities said Conway “pulled a pistol from his clothing” and “fired several rounds” at the deputies and the dog.

In the annals of prisoner-of-war videos, this seems to be a first. A slightly befuddled-looking Belgian Malinois appears on a tight leash, surrounded by heavily armed, bearded men boasting of their battlefield loot. Wearing a black protective vest, the dog wags its tail at certain points and appears more confused than terrified as its captors showcase specialized rifles and a global positioning device with a blinking light that they say came attached to the canine. “Allah gave victory to the mujahideen!” one of the fighters exclaims. “Down with them, down with their spies!” A link to the video was posted this week on the Twitter account of a user who often disseminates Taliban propaganda. A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the dog was captured after a long firefight between coalition forces and Taliban fighters in the Alin Nigar district of Afghanistan’s Laghman province in late December. “The mujahideen valorously put tough resistance against the troops for hours,” he said in a phone interview Thursday. The dog, he said, carries the rank of colonel and was outfitted with sophisticated electronic devices. “The dog was of high significance to the Americans,” he said. Lt. Col. Will Griffin, a spokesman for the international military coalition in Afghanistan, confirmed Thursday in an e-mail that the force lost a military working dog during an operation in December. He did not provide further details. Officials at the Pentagon said they could recall no prior instance of a military working dog being taken captive. The canine was attached to a British special forces unit that was engaged in a fatal firefight on Dec. 23, according to a military official who confirmed the nationality of the dog on the condition of anonymity because the British Defense Ministry has chosen not to do so. Also featured in the video are two M-4 assault rifles with scopes that are commonly used by special operations forces in Afghanistan. The video caught the attention of analysts at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks and studies insurgent propaganda. The group’s founder, Rita Katz, said she could not recall anything like it. “I don’t remember seeing a dog used as a hostage,” she said after checking her database. The only time canines were featured in insurgent propaganda, Katz said, was in Iraq when insurgents once proposed using them as unsuspecting suicide bombers. U.S. Special Operations troops often use the Belgian Malinois, a breed favored for its light weight, agility and endurance. They are trained to parachute and rappel with their handlers. Some are trained to sniff out explosives; others learn how to find narcotics. In Afghanistan, canines are often used to search compounds that might be rigged with explosives before humans move in. The use of dogs in combat missions has been one of the grievances Afghan President Hamid Karzai has raised with his foreign benefactors. Many Muslims hold a dim view of canines and worry that being around the animals makes them impure — thus unfit to pray. Few Afghans keep them as pets, although many groom the animals for dogfighting, a popular gambling sport that was banned by the Taliban but has become popular again. Military working dogs have been killed in bombings and shootings in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Maybe the dog was released to attack or search off-leash and the dog never returned,” said Kevin Dredden, a former Air Force dog handler and Afghanistan veteran who works as a program manager at AMK9, a firm that trains dogs to work with law enforcement and military units. “Maybe it was unsafe for them to go back and find him.” One thing is certain, Dredden said. “I know for sure the handler is devastated,” he said, noting the tight bonds that handlers and military dogs forge. Dogs are given ranks that make them senior to their handlers, a practice designed to ensure that the humans treat the animals with deference. They have a rank patch on their body armor. When President Obama visited Fort Campbell, Ky., to thank the elite troops who found and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, the name of only one of the special operators was disclosed: Cairo, the team’s Belgian Malinois. Sayed Salahuddin in Kabul contributed to this report.	105	"[{""start"": 1134, ""end"": 1393, ""text"": ""The dog was of high significance to the Americans,” he said. Lt. Col.

Cairo has company. The Navy Seal-trained Belgian Malinois — part of the team that cornered and killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 — was perhaps the most famous frontline K-9 until Wednesday, when a 23-year-old Maryland man became the latest charged with hoisting himself over the White House fence. The suspect was brought down with the help of Hurricane and Jordan, two of the dogs in the Secret Service patrol of the presidental mansion. The dogs were treated by a veterinarian for minor bruising suffered in the tussle with the alleged jumper, identified as Dominic Adesanya. They will be back in service soon. “Both K-9s were cleared for duty by the veterinarian,” Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan wrote in an e-mail on Thursday. Few details have emerged of Hurricane and Jordan. But it’s clear they are — so to speak — a special breed. Secret Service dogs must pass rigorous training in specialites such as subduing assailants and detecting explosives. Like many security agencies and militaries, the Secret Service uses Belgian Malanois, a breed similar to German shepherds but smaller and more compact. An adult male weighs more than 60 pounds and can run in bursts twice as fast as the swiftest human. Its short hair makes it ideal for work in heat. The Secret Service, which began its K-9 program in 1975, puts the canine candidates through 20 weeks of training. After they are cleared for duty, they remain with their handler around the clock and undergoes at least eight hours a week of refresher training. “They become part of the family,” said a Secret Service Web site. Most Secret Service dogs work until they are about 10 years old. “When a canine is ready to retire,” the Secret Service site said, “it is retired to the handler.” Use of dogs in warfare and protection goes back to antiquity. Over the centuries, they have been used as messengers, bomb sniffers, trackers and scouts. The World War I exploits of “Sergeant Stubby,” described as a Boston bull terrier, include claims that he saved his regiment by sniffing out incoming mustard gas and helped capture a German soldier by latching onto his trousers. The “sergeant” became a mascot for Georgetown University. Navy Seal dogs may be baddest of the bunch. They are outfitted with Kevlar vests and learn how to strap on for parachute jumps with their handlers. And fallen K-9s merit full honors. Homeland Security bestowed an official commemoration for Maxo, a 3-year-old Malinois who fell to its death in 2013 from the sixth floor of a parking area in New Orleans while doing advance sweeps for a visit by Vice President Joe Biden.  	104	"[{""start"": 436, ""end"": 574, ""text"": ""The dogs were treated by a veterinarian for minor bruising suffered in the tussle with the alleged jumper, identified as Dominic Adesanya."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2372, ""end"": 2608, ""text"": ""Homeland Security bestowed an official commemoration for Maxo, a 3-year-old Malinois who fell to its death in 2013 from the sixth floor of a parking area in New Orleans while doing advance sweeps for a visit by Vice President Joe Biden."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	115	2023-03-18T21:28:25.010563Z	2023-03-18T21:28:25.010646Z	1209.682
1) Sergeant Rex (Atria, $26) is Marine Mike Dowling’s account of his 2004 deployment with his military working dog, a German shepherd named Rex. Tasked with seeking out improvised explosive devices and hidden ammunition as part of a unit in Iraq’s Triangle of Death, Mike and Rex form a tight partnership. Briskly written with Damien Lewis, Dowling’s account has many suspenseful moments as well as interesting facts about how dogs are selected, trained, paired with a human and even ranked as service members. Dowling explains that “military working dogs are given a rank one higher than that of their handler.” If the handler receives a promotion, so, too, does his dog. While the jargon-heavy dialogue and tight pacing suggest that “Sergeant Rex” is meant to be a dog book for manly men, it’s also a moving portrait of a relationship between battle buddies that transcends gender and species. 2) Dogs jumping from airplanes, dogs sacrificing their lives to save their handlers, dogs patrolling dense tropical jungles — such heroics may seem the stuff of animation fantasy, but Lisa Rogak’s The Dogs of War (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin’s; paperback, $14.99) documents the real-life valor of canine warriors. Rogak is to be commended for the book’s encyclopedic scope and rich historical detail. Did you know that during World War II, Hollywood stars such as Mary Pickford donated their pets to Dogs for Defense — later the K-9 Corps — for use as sentries and to guard the coasts against spy infiltration? Particularly engrossing are the thumbnail portraits of war dogs such as Bodo, an explosive-detection German shepherd partnered with Spec. Joaquin Mello in Iraq. During a routine route-clearing mission, Mello recalls, his dog started ignoring his lead, and “all of a sudden Bodo jerked sharply behind me, and him jerking the leash jerked my head up. I heard a whiz and a loud ping like metal hitting rock. . . . Someone just shot at me. If Bodo hadn’t pulled me back, it would have hit me right in the head. . . . I started thinking about it: ‘Wow, my dog just saved my life.’ ” 3) “The wind sulked around Hampton Lane Cemetery like a child lamenting the loss of a favorite toy.” So begins the purplish prologue to Gareth Crocker’s Finding Jack (St. Martin’s Griffin; paperback, $14.99), an enjoyable, if flawed, novel. At the book’s beginning in 1972, 29-year-old journalist Fletcher Carson stops to visit the graves of his wife and young daughter, who were killed in a plane crash. He has enlisted in the Army and is headed to Vietnam, quite possibly on a grief-propelled suicide mission. There, he finds an abandoned scout dog, a Labrador he names Jack, whom his unit adopts as its unofficial mascot. Part pal, part doggie Rambo, Jack works his way so deep into Carson’s heart that when the cease-fire comes and the unit gets word that military dogs are to be left behind, Carson takes off with Jack on a journey out of Vietnam, across Laos and into Thailand, where he plans to smuggle the dog home. Gory infections, privation and an incredible rescue (both military and paranormal) ensue. Short on plausibility but long on butch sentimentality, “Finding Jack” elicits sighs of both frustration and fantasy fulfillment. Burana is the author of “I Love a Man in Uniform.”	102	"[{""start"": 899, ""end"": 1019, ""text"": ""Dogs jumping from airplanes, dogs sacrificing their lives to save their handlers, dogs patrolling dense tropical jungles"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 899, ""end"": 1019, ""text"": ""Dogs jumping from airplanes, dogs sacrificing their lives to save their handlers, dogs patrolling dense tropical jungles"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	113	2023-03-18T21:06:55.938547Z	2023-03-18T21:06:55.938633Z	203.379
A police dog in Washington state died this week after ingesting meth while working with authorities who were serving a narcotics search warrant, according to reports. The dog, named Barney, ingested the drug “through contact with his nose,” Tacoma Police Department public information officer Loretta Cool wrote in an e-mail to The Post on Friday. Barney was taken away from the scene and later rushed to a veterinary hospital. The dog’s behavior had changed and his temperature spiked, Cool wrote. Here’s what happened, according to the News Tribune: Narcotics dogs are trained to alert their handlers to drugs by placing their nose on them. In this case, Barney accidentally inhaled residue from the substance. He suffered seizures, and his body temperature soared to 109 degrees. Barney — who had worked with the department for five years — died Wednesday night, according to the Facebook post from the department, which noted that the dog was “highly respected throughout the law enforcement community.” “Barney will be remembered as a dedicated member of our department who, without a doubt, made Tacoma safer by virtue of his work and his service,” Chief Donald Ramsdell said in the post. “Barney died in the line of duty and will be honored as such.” A department memorial service is being planned, said Cool, who called Barney “a wonderful dog” who was “always full of energy and ready.” “He’s a phenomenal dog,” his handler, Officer Henry Betts, told KING 5 News. “Really just incredible.” According to the News Tribune, the search that the 11-year-old Labrador mix was involved in resulted in three arrests. “After working with the Tacoma Police Department over the past few days, it was clear how much the Officers loved and respected Barney,” Kobi Johnson, a senior clinician with the veterinary hospital that cared for the dog, said in the Facebook post. “We join them in mourning the loss of their comrade and offer condolences.” Read More: With fake service dogs on the rise, Canada proposes doggie ‘driving license’ A missing Ohio police dog who survived one of the coldest winters in history has been found California police dog becomes a police detective	101	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 238, ""text"": ""A police dog in Washington state died this week after ingesting meth while working with authorities who were serving a narcotics search warrant, according to reports.

‘The canine’s nose is a masterful creation,” Rebecca Frankel writes in this exceptionally interesting and surprisingly moving book; “all earthly schnozes are not created equal, anatomically speaking. While the average dog has roughly 220 million scent receptors in his nasal cavity, the average human has around 5 million.” Reading that, I flushed with pride on behalf of my rescue pooch, Clifford, whom I take on business trips several times a day but whose business consists more of sniffing (his name really should be Snifford) than of pooping. Then, a few pages later, came this zinger: “Where some breeds, like dachshunds, have 125 million scent receptors, and German shepherds have 225 million receptors, the bloodhound has on average 300 million.” Alas, poor Clifford: He is a dachshund, and based on those numbers he’ll never qualify as an MWD, or military working dog. Truth to tell, this is for the best, as Clifford is far too goofy to be a fierce combatant. No doubt, though, he would love to meet any and all of the splendid dogs — German shepherds, bloodhounds, Belgian Malinois, labradors — who parade proudly through these pages, though any of them could have him for lunch if they so desired. But in fact military dogs are trained not to be fierce but to be intelligent, to use their incredibly sensitive ears and eyes to identify danger in its many forms and to give their human colleagues the chance to quell it. Frankel is an editor at Foreign Policy and is responsible for two of that eminent journal’s most popular items: a weekly column called “Rebecca’s War Dog of the Week” and a photo essay called “War Dog,” which has been viewed online more than 16 million times. This book is a logical extension of those interests, but as she says in her opening chapter, “I thought I would be writing a book about dogs who live their lives in the service of the military . . . [but] I was surprised when I realized I was actually writing a book about people,” in particular the handlers, men and women, who train military working dogs and then accompany them into battle or wherever else they may be called to serve. On the evidence Frankel provides, it’s hard not to conclude that handlers are special people. They are soldiers through and through — “Despite the many likely hazards waiting for them in a war-zone, most of these handlers are excited to get downrange. . . . If they’ve been to Iraq, they’re looking forward to a tour in Afghanistan” — but they are “their own breed.” The form of service known as K-9 “is a lifelong state of mind . . . the mark of which lives on long past the dogs, long after the wars are over.” Frankel writes: “Any handler who has brought a dog with him or her to war will say it made all the difference in the world. They will say that the dog by their side provided them with something more than just a living, breathing piece of home — it acted as a talisman, insulating them from whatever horrors unfolded, bringing them peace in turbulence, offering companionship in times of loneliness. It made the path through war bearable, the unendurable somehow endurable, and many will say they came through the other side more stable.” Anticipating objections, Frankel writes at the outset: “I avoid the question of whether or not it is ethical to involve animals in fighting our wars. There are legitimate cases to be made on both sides, but we do employ animals in war and we rely on them heavily.” Read almost any history of the Civil War or World War I and you will be impressed, or more likely depressed, by the number of mules and horses that were killed serving in those conflicts, a number that probably runs into the millions. Horses and mules were used as beasts of burden, whereas dogs are used for their intelligence (the breeds most commonly enlisted are among the very smartest) and their gifts of detection. Inasmuch as countless dogs are abused by their owners, euthanized in shelters or otherwise mistreated, one can only be struck by the kindness with which the MWDs are treated and the love they inspire. For me it’s a no-brainer: If military dogs serve us, by the same token we serve them. Indeed, it is worth noting that in their earliest known appearances in battle, “it was not their inborn supersenses or their natural intelligence that was put to task, but rather something more primitive, fierce, and undisciplined,” and doubtless “these early war dogs took more lives than they saved.” That began to change in World War I, when “all tallied — including messenger dogs, mercy dogs, Red and Blue Cross dogs — upward of 75,000 dogs were on the ground in official war-related roles.” Then, in World War II, the American military “settled on five breeds: German shepherds, Belgian sheep dogs, Doberman pinschers, farm collies, and giant schnauzers” as having the temperament and skills needed in war dogs. The best of them became scout dogs, Frankel says, which had “nearly instantaneous” effectiveness because of their ability to detect enemy troops at a distance of about 1,000 yards. In Vietnam, then in Iraq and Afghanistan, the employment of dogs reached new levels of sophistication. They were primarily scout dogs in Vietnam, where their success was so great that the demand exceeded the supply of available dogs. Then, in our last two wars, they became expert at detecting the improvised explosive devices that terrorists use as lethally effective weapons against troops (and innocent civilians as well) on the ground. They are trained at the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona under a program known as Inter-Service Skills K-9. Frankel spent several arduous days there, observing the dogs and their handlers, and participating in some of the exercises herself, an experience that left her with a heightened appreciation for the skills and dedication of all concerned. Though her book is principally about MWDs, she reminds us that dogs serve us in other places and in other ways: working for the Department of Homeland Security, which now has “over 900 canine teams working in 120 airports nationwide”; as therapy dogs, especially for victims of post-traumatic stress disorders, soldiers and civilians alike; and as guide dogs, a role that of course they have performed for many generations for the blind and other disabled persons. In all these roles, they are as susceptible to injury and emotional stress as the people they aid. “It would be counterintuitive, even foolhardy, to assume that dogs can experience war but are somehow immune to its hardships, that they do not shoulder its burdens,” Frankel writes. “Dogs experience the same heat, the same chaos, the same injuries, the same violence, and the same trauma. . . . Military working dogs, like soldiers, return from war changed.” Now, with the war in Afghanistan winding down (or whatever exactly is happening there), Frankel is concerned about the future of the MWD program, as well she should be. The “urgent need for dogs is already depleting and will likely continue to lessen over time,” and “the military working dog program is already downsizing its combat-ready dogs accordingly.” Yet “when the call for the dogs comes again — as it inevitably will — years and energy [will be] spent rebuilding and reinventing.” It would be nice to think that this fine book will cause the military to keep the MWD program active, if necessarily smaller, and to continue research into the ways in which dogs can help us, but history — the history of the American military especially — leaves little reason to believe that will happen.

At the beginning of “War Dogs ,” Rebecca Frankel presents us with an uncomfortable truth: “There is something less complicated (and ironically more human) about relating to war through the story of a dog.” By the end of her heart-warming and heart-wrenching book, you’ll know what she means — if you don’t already. As almost any dog owner will tell you, canines are remarkable animals. What makes them especially valuable on the battlefield is their sophisticated sense of smell, which, according to Frankel, is a thousand times sharper than that of humans. This superpower, along with their loyalty, desire for rewards and, well, doggedness, has prompted the modern U.S. armed forces to use dogs to find bombs and improvised explosive devices. Frankel spends a lot of time introducing us to the dogs doing this dangerous work and their handlers. Her narrative takes us from stateside training kennels to war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as through time. Frankel says it’s unclear how long dogs have been used in wartime. The United States, she says, “has been woefully behind” in employing military dogs, with no official authorization until the creation of the Dogs for Defense program in 1942 during World War II. More than 20,000 pets were given to the military by their owners. Dogs proved crucial during the Vietnam War, too, with scout dogs saving an estimated 2,000 lives within the first year of their arrival. Shockingly, of the 5,000 dogs who served there from 1964 to 1975, only 204 ever left. Frankel, a senior editor at Foreign Policy, began writing about war dogs in 2010 for one of the publication’s blogs. In researching the book, she has stepped further into this world: donning a bite suit that doesn’t fully insulate her from the pain inflicted by a Dutch shepherd named Rambo, participating in the same brutal eight-mile “ruck march” as dogs and handlers in training, and accepting failure as a handler looking for a hypothetical bomb when she gets entangled in a leash. Frankel unequivocally expresses her belief in the necessity of war dogs but steers clear of the ethical questions of involving animals in “our wars.” She explores the debates over whether dogs actually love us and whether it’s appropriate for their handlers to get attached to them. Readers will surely find themselves attached to the four- and two-legged characters they meet. And, no, not all the dogs or people make it home alive. It’s enough to make you want to grab a box of tissues — and the nearest dog. Man’s best friend, indeed. Becky Krystal is a member of The Washington Post’s Food and Going Out Guide staffs.

Robert Crais has long been one of the finest American crime writers, but he has won new praise and new fans with a surprising new character: a fearless 85-pound German shepherd. Maggie is a K-9 dog with the Los Angeles Police Department’s bomb squad and has bonded deeply with K-9 Officer Scott James. Both are combat veterans of Afghanistan, and each would kill — or die — for the other. They were introduced in Crais’s 2013 novel “Suspect ,” and together they help make his new novel, “The Promise,” one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year. Scott and Maggie are only part of the story, of course. As with most of Crais’s novels — “The Promise” is his 20th — his star is wisecracking private eye Elvis Cole. As the book begins, Cole is hired to find Amy Breslyn, whose son was killed by a terrorist’s bomb in Nigeria. Half-mad with grief, Amy has reached out to Los Angeles gangsters who say they will put her in contact with terrorists who can answer questions about her son’s death. Because she’s an expert on explosives, she can promise the terrorists weapons they urgently want in exchange for their information. Cole’s search for Amy leads him to a cache of explosives. That brings Scott James and Maggie into the story, because of Maggie’s bomb-sniffing skills. The trouble-prone Cole is soon at odds with both the LAPD and the Department of Homeland Security. When a senior official of DHS shows Cole his photo ID, the detective quips, “Nice picture. Makes you look tough.” Scott and Maggie are soon threatened by a killer whose golden rule is “Never leave a witness.” Scott and Maggie, alas, were witnesses who saw him leave a murder scene. The man’s effort to poison Maggie leads to one of the book’s most moving moments, when Scott says, in rage and disbelief, “He tried to kill my dog.” As far as Scott is concerned, this is enough to justify revenge. “The Promise” is filled with suspense, surprises and ably drawn characters, but its most fascinating moments involve Maggie. We learn that she was wounded in Afghanistan, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and dreams of her first handler, a Marine who was killed there, after which she came home and partnered with Scott. Maggie has been conditioned to protect a human partner, and the novel shows how law enforcement makes excellent use of her loyalty and skill. There is, for example, her remarkable sense of smell: “With more than two hundred million scent receptors in her long shepherd’s nose, and almost a fourth of her brain devoted to her sense of smell, Maggie could recognize scents so faint they were measured in parts per trillion.” Moreover, the dog can hear “the whine of a jet at thirty thousand feet, termites chewing through wood, the crystal in Scott’s watch hum, and thousands of sounds as invisible to Scott as the scents he could not smell.” She is thus poised for action when she senses danger to Scott: “The fur on her back and shoulders bristled like wire, and her nails raked the asphalt like claws. A danger she couldn’t see or hear or smell was coming, but a fire passed down from a hundred thousand past generations prepared her. Maggie knew what she needed to know. “Hunt. “Attack. “Pull the threat down with her fangs, and destroy it. “Maggie didn’t need to know anything else. “Nothing else mattered.” Maggie is both a superhero and a wonderful character. The Mystery Writers of America last year honored Crais with its Grand Master Award, putting him in the company of such greats as James Lee Burke, Sue Grafton, Stephen King and Elmore Leonard. “The Promise” shows once again why he belongs there.

They come from different lands — one from Pennsylvania, the other from the Netherlands. They don’t speak the same language, but since they were paired more than two years ago, Laurel police officer Jesse Conyngham and his German shepherd partner, Gaston, have been inseparable as they work to nip crime in the bud. This month, Conyngham was named Laurel’s officer of the year, in recognition of his hard work, high number of arrests and role as a department use-of-force trainer, as well as his community activities, such as fundraising for the Maryland Special Olympics. “He’s a well-rounded and very capable officer,” said Laurel Police Chief Rich McLaughlin. “He and his dog have been responsible for a number of arrests. They work very well together and have been a very successful team. We’re fortunate to have them both.” Conyngham thinks Gaston should be recognized for his work as well, and has nominated him for the Hero Dog Award given out by the American Humane Association. Now in its third year, the Hero Dog Award was created to honor courageous canines, AHA spokeswoman Jody Frisch said. “It’s to really show the vital bonds between humans and dogs, and that’s really what the American Humane Association is all about,” Frisch said. Conyngham, a five-year veteran of the department, had 90 arrests last year, nearly half of them drug arrests made with Gaston. During one incident in 2011, Gaston helped police seize 17 pounds of marijuana. “It was on a call for the vice unit for Anne Arundel County,” Conyngham said. “He alerted on a package that was being mailed [from a package-shipping business], and so they wrote a search warrant to seize the narcotics.” Gaston is trained to uncover drugs and in a number of other areas that Conyngham said fall under the category of “patrol work.” “He does location tracking, human-scent tracking, either for criminals or for missing persons. If somebody walks across a field, he can track where they walked. He does article searches, building clearing, area searches,” Conyngham said. Gaston is one of 15 dogs nominated for the Hero Dog Award in the law enforcement/arson dog category. The winner is determined by online voting at herodogawards.org until July 30. The owner or handler of the winning dog in each of eight categories will receive $1,500 for their favorite charity; the owner or handler of the one voted Hero Dog 2013 will receive an additional $5,000. If Gaston wins, the money will go to Vested Interest in K9s, a Boston-based nonprofit group that raises money to purchase bullet- and stab-proof vests for law enforcement dogs. The Laurel Police Department was recently awarded vests for its five dogs by the organization, and Conyngham hopes to be able to give back. Police dogs put their lives on the line as much as, if not more than, human officers, he said, and they deserve protection as well. Unlike human partners, K-9 partners live with their handlers when they’re not on duty. This creates a special bond between the two, Conyngham said. “It’s not like anything you’ve seen,” he said. “Most of the K-9 handlers become inseparable from their dogs.” Gaston works hard but likes to clown around when he’s off-duty. “Even working dogs need some time to just be a regular dog,” Conyngham said. “He’s more like a pet dog when he’s off-duty. He’s like a puppy. He’s very playful. He likes to hang out and play with my other dogs.”	97	"[{""start"": 2741, ""end"": 2872, ""text"": ""Police dogs put their lives on the line as much as, if not more than, human officers, he said, and they deserve protection as well."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2741, ""end"": 2872, ""text"": ""Police dogs put their lives on the line as much as, if not more than, human officers, he said, and they deserve protection as well."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	108	2023-03-18T20:46:50.223639Z	2023-03-18T20:46:50.223784Z	546.9
He often said they would die together. That if one went, the other would go soon after, that he would not make it without Mike. They had been to war and back twice. They were a team in Iraq and a team in the long war at home, facing a daunting return to civilian life. Both the man and the dog came back damaged, diagnosed with post-traumatic stress, and they were healing together. But Sgt. Matthew Bessler’s worst nightmare came true when Mike, his wartime partner-turned service dog, was shot and killed on Oct. 10th in Powell, Wyo., by a bicyclist who said the dog was attacking him. “That dog was the other half of me,” Bessler, 43, said in a long, often tearful, telephone interview on Sunday. The Army Ranger’s relationship with the dog was first chronicled in the Washington Post in July. [A soldier and his combat dog both returned from the Iraq War with PTSD — and found support in each other] As word of the dog’s death spread in Powell, Bessler’s friends leapt into action, starting with a fundraising campaign to help him pay for a burial with military honors. Jess Campbell, who owns The Gym in Powell started a gofundme campaign to raise money for all the costs associated with a war hero’s burial. Campbell, who met Bessler and Mike when Bessler started taking a 5 a.m. weight-training class, set what she thought was a lofty goal: $10,000, expecting a few thousand dollars to come in, she said. As of Sunday night, the campaign had raised almost $13,000. While the donations were pouring in, Campbell also heard from veteran and combat dog advocacy groups that have committed to covering all the costs associated with the burial and funeral and to providing Bessler with a new service dog. A private donor has even volunteered to  pay to erect a memorial to “Major Mike” in a local park. “What was amazing was all of the organizations and all of the people who came out,” Campbell said. “I can’t wait to sit down and show Matt that people all over the country support him and Mike.” Many unanswered questions surround the details of the shooting by the man, who had a revolver holstered to his bicycle. (The gun holster is visible in a photograph with the sheriff’s report on the incident). The man told officers from the Park County Sheriff’s Office that he feared for his life when the dog tried to attack him on a quiet country road near Bessler’s house in Powell, a rural farming community of about 6,000 people in northern Wyoming. Bessler was away for the night with his girlfriend and left the dog in the care of his roommate, Jody Church, a letter carrier in town. Church had watched Mike for Bessler before, although it was rare that Bessler and Mike were separated. The day Mike died, Church went on an errand for a few hours and left Mike and Bessler’s other dog in a fenced-in yard, he said, and had no idea how Mike could have gotten out to the road. Bessler said Mike never went out onto the road, beyond the fence around his 2.5-acre property. The dog was shot in the back, according to authorities, and did not die instantly, limping from where he was shot to the garage behind Bessler’s house, where a neighbor soon found him dead. The 59-year-old bicyclist left the scene after shooting Mike, but told authorities he didn’t believe he had killed the dog. [A 75-year-old veteran saved children from a knife attack during a chess club meeting] The bicyclist’s identity was being withheld “due to the possibility of repercussions,” Lance Mathess, the public affairs officer for the Park County Sheriff, said in an e-mail. The man had no injuries, authorities said. There were no direct witnesses to the shooting and the sheriff’s office concluded that the man was not guilty of any wrongdoing. Bessler adopted Mike after their last deployment in 2010, and the Belgian Malinois then became a service dog, helping Bessler with his symptoms of PTSD and brain injury. Mike was retired from the military because he stopped doing his job, sniffing out explosives or chasing enemy combatants, a key sign of what is known as Canine PTSD. He had also crushed most of his teeth chewing rocks when he returned from the war, a sign of his anxiety, and Bessler said he was planning on getting him fitted for dentures soon. When he retired, the Army promoted Mike, who helped Bessler earn two Bronze stars for their work in Iraq, to the rank of major. He was credited with detecting thousands of pounds of deadly explosives and survived a near drowning in a river in Basra province. Retired war dogs are not entitled to funerals or burials with military honors, Army officials said, but Bessler’s friends and supporters say they hope to use Mike’s death to push the military to change that policy. Campbell said the first priority is to help Bessler heal. “The shooting is controversial,”  Campbell said. “And everybody is going to have an opinion, but no matter what you believe about that moment, we are past that and now Matt needs this and he deserves all of this.” While Bessler is stricken, sleepless and said the last week has been a “complete blur,” he said all the support is helping him face what happened. Over the weekend media outlets and Web sites across the country picked up news of the dog’s death, while Bessler took a trip to the mountains to find some peace, he said. He was out of cell range until Sunday afternoon, but as soon as his phone received a signal, he said, his phone was “blowing up” with messages and texts. He had several voice messages from people offering to buy him a new service dog. Mike, who was 10 when he died,  helped Bessler with anxiety and other symptoms of PTSD and brain injury. The veteran served 20 years in the military, more than half of his career in special operations and served six tours in Iraq. But it is far too painful, Bessler said, to think about another dog  now. “You can’t replace him,” he said. “He was a part of me. It’s like trying to say you can replace a member of your family.” Want more inspiring news and ideas to improve your life? Sign up for the Saturday Inspired Life newsletter.

Briar Woods High School, a half-hour drive from the CIA’s headquarters in Northern Virginia, might have provided an ideal training ground for the agency’s bomb-sniffing dogs. Its labyrinthine hallways and voluminous classrooms are home to something that can wreak havoc for the canines: polished floors, which cause dogs to slip and lose their focus as they hunt for explosives. That was one reason the school, which educates nearly 1,700 students in Ashburn, played host to a CIA dog team for a training exercise while students were on spring break last week, according to the Loudoun County school system. But the choice to go to a public school for the quiet exercise has led to an only-in-Washington embarrassment for the elite spy agency, which left explosive material behind in the engine compartment of a school bus that then shuttled special-needs children for two days this week. A mechanic discovered and removed the explosive putty — which county Supervisor Koran Saines (D-Sterling) said was the demolition explosive C-4 — during a routine bus maintenance check Wednesday. Until then, no one noticed that it was missing. That the CIA was using live explosives and lost track of them in a place where children and teachers spend their days has raised concerns among parents about the use of a school facility for such kinds of law enforcement training. It also illuminates the fact that local authorities and school systems feel obliged to prepare for scenarios that once seemed unthinkable, such as gunmen firing at schoolchildren and bombs hidden on buses. Loudoun County schools spokesman Wayde Byard described the material as “putty-like,” and the CIA said the material “is very stable and insensitive to physical shocks,” descriptions that are consistent with plastic explosives, which require special detonators to set off. Saines, who was briefed on the mishap Wednesday by county personnel, said county officials confirmed that it was C-4. Dean Boyd, a CIA spokesman, said that the training team left behind “explosive material used as a training device for K-9s. This material is commonly used by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to train K-9s in explosives detection.” The agency “has taken immediate steps to strengthen inventory and control procedures in its K-9 program to prevent such incidents from happening again,” Boyd said, noting that the CIA has done a full inventory of explosive material used in the training program. “CIA is a part of the Northern Virginia community and we will do whatever it takes to prevent this from happening again.” The CIA opened a center to train bomb-sniffing dogs for police departments and other agencies in the Washington region in December 2010, after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives curtailed its program. Since then, the intelligence agency has trained dogs for the Fairfax County Police Department, the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, the Loudoun County Fire Marshal’s Office, the FBI and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, according to the CIA and Loudoun officials. The sheriff’s office has been working with the CIA K-9 unit since 2012. In addition to providing initial training courses, the CIA has organized recurring training for dogs, including the session at Briar Woods High. The county’s schools make their facilities available to law enforcement agencies for training; Byard said all law enforcement training in school facilities has been suspended pending a review of protocols. Kraig Troxell, a spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office, said the office sent two dogs and their handlers to join the CIA team at the training. It was at least the second time this year that the CIA has done a dog-training exercise at Briar Woods High. Troxell said it is essential for dogs to train in scenarios they will encounter on the job. He said four county schools have been searched for explosives during the past year. “Real-world training exercises enable law enforcement agencies across the country to prepare and test their personnel on how they respond to critical incidents such as terrorism, active-shooter incidents and other emergencies,” Troxell said. “In conducting training at these schools, we’re taking the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the school so that when the call does come in to respond for operational reasons, whether it’s to a bomb threat or an active shooter, we can be as effective as possible in mitigating any possible threat to our kids and teachers.” Since school attacks in Columbine, Colo., in Newtown, Conn., and at Virginia Tech, law enforcement and school security officers have worked together to drill for all sorts of potentially catastrophic events. Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said it is a common practice for police departments to use school facilities to train for active-shooter situations. “They normally will use them during the summer months when the children are out of school,” Stephens said. “This training does not involve the use of live ammunition or explosives. . . . It is to ensure that the training takes place in a safe environment.” Experts and former CIA officials said it seemed highly unusual for the CIA to use live explosives in a school for a training exercise, and community members said it was stunning to learn that explosives would ever be present at a school. School board member Debbie Rose (Algonkian) said she was “surprised” when she heard that the CIA accidentally left the explosives on a school bus and added that she did not know that the agency was using school grounds for training. “We know, too, that preparation and training does save lives,” Rose said. “It’s an unfortunate reality of the world today that we have.” The Loudoun County Fire Marshal’s Office typically trains its bomb-sniffing dog in a school facility at least once a month using real explosives, Deputy Fire Marshal Jerry Swain said. His department has strict inventory protocols, such as weighing materials to ensure that no explosives are left behind at the schools, warehouses and county-owned facilities they use. “One of the things that we try to do with all canines is expose them to as many different environments and surfaces as we can, so then when the real call comes in, they will already be familiar with that particular environment,” Swain said. “The animals being familiar with the environment they’re going to work in makes them less apprehensive . . . they’ll be more focused.” It is unclear what, if any, sanction a CIA employee would face for leaving the explosives behind, and a Loudoun fire department spokeswoman said officials determined that there was no crime involved. But having explosive materials on a school bus or on school grounds normally would lead to serious consequences for a student or a teacher, even if it was an accident, advocates for reforming school discipline policies said. “If this had been a young person, they probably would have been arrested and most certainly would have been suspended from school — and they would have had their education disrupted substantially,” said Thena Robinson-Mock, a lawyer for the Advancement Project, a national organization that advocates for an end to harsh school discipline policies. Robinson-Mock pointed to incidents in which students have been arrested even though no crime was committed and no one was in danger, such as when Texas teen Ahmed Mohamed brought a homemade clock to his high school. Other students have been suspended, expelled or arrested for chewing a pastry into the shape of a gun, having a toy gun on a bus and having a knife in a gym bag that was used for equipment maintenance. “We’re holding young people, particularly children of color, to a very different standard,” said Robinson-Mock. Jen Underwood, the mother of two elementary school students in Loudoun, praised school officials’ efforts to communicate with families about the incident. The school system informed all parents of its 77,000 students about the mishap via email Wednesday night. “I appreciated that they were pretty forthcoming as opposed to trying to hide it,” she said. Underwood said it makes sense for law enforcement agencies to train inside schools. “They need to know how to respond in a school situation,” she said. “There’s a lot of stuff that happens inside schools, and I’d rather they know how to respond than not.” But she said she wanted to know more about how the CIA managed to overlook the explosive material it left behind. “I’m surprised that if they use those school buses for training, which makes sense, and they use explosive material, which also makes sense, that they don’t have some kind of inventory,” Underwood said. “Like, ‘I brought this much with me, I’m taking this much home with me.’ ”	94	"[{""start"": 175, ""end"": 378, ""text"": ""ts labyrinthine hallways and voluminous classrooms are home to something that can wreak havoc for the canines: polished floors, which cause dogs to slip and lose their focus as they hunt for explosives."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	105	2023-03-18T20:19:08.331502Z	2023-03-18T20:19:08.331594Z	11004.031
Officer Mike Parcells has been through this before. Earlier this week, a man suspected in a 2014 shooting and a K-9 police dog were both killed in California when a standoff between the suspect and law enforcement ended in gunfire, authorities said. The dog was handled by Parcells, a 23-year veteran of the department; it was the second dog that the officer had “lost in the line of duty,” the Long Beach Police Department wrote on Facebook. After the death, other officers mourned 4-year-old Credo, who had been working with the department for two years and was involved in more than 30 apprehensions, according to the post. Parcells also worked with Ranger, a Belgian Malinois that was shot during a 2005 SWAT call, according to the post on social media. Credo, another Belgian Malinois, died after officers were called to assist in the pursuit of the suspect  Tuesday. KNBC, a local NBC affiliate, reported: Long Beach police officers stood in formation for a farewell to Credo outside the veterinarian’s office Tuesday afternoon. Parcells appeared inconsolable, breaking down in tears as Credo was loaded into the K-9 cruiser. “Please keep Ofc. Parcells and his family in your thoughts as they deal with this tragic loss,” the department wrote on Facebook. The shooting happened Tuesday after members of a U.S. Marshals fugitive task force saw a man who was suspected in connection with a 2014 shooting, according to a news release. The man fled into an apartment, and officers from Long Beach responded to help. The man eventually left the apartment but would not respond to officers’ commands, police said. He started to “aggressively charge” at authorities, who responded with rubber bullets. “The suspect continued his aggressive charge toward officers while canine Credo continued to try and stop the suspect from advancing towards officers,” the release says. Police say the man pulled out a knife while he was struggling with Credo, and he kept coming toward the officers. That’s when an officer fired, the release sayss. Both the dog and the man were hit, according to the release. The man, whose name was not immediately released, was taken to a local hospital, where he died from his wounds.

KATHMANDU, Nepal — For members of Fairfax County’s disaster-response team — both two-legged and four-legged — the grim challenges of searching for trapped survivors of Nepal’s massive earthquake this week have been familiar and fulfilling. For the humans, most of them firefighters with years of disaster experience, the operation has brought reminders of missions after major quakes in Haiti and Turkey as part of the U.S. government’s Disaster Assistance Response Team. Among the similarities they describe are the swaths of flattened, poorly built houses; the intricate and painfully slow task of listening for faint sounds and extricating trapped survivors; and the instant bonds formed among strangers working frantically to save lives. “Working with people who have a common purpose to save life is a great equalizer,” said Mike Davis, 45. “You don’t have the politics of a war or conflict. You are working on a humanitarian rescue, so you have a common language.” At their tent camp inside a former U.S. Embassy compound here Friday, Davis and another Fairfax team member, Kit Hessel, 47, described an indelible memory from the Haiti quake in 2010: a 24-hour operation to rescue a woman trapped in a university stairwell, which ultimately required cutting off her foot to save her life. “We had people hanging upside down to get to her,” Davis recounted. “She had to have her leg amputated later, but she lived, and later she got in touch with us to thank us.” Hessel, a fire battalion chief in Fairfax, described another difficult rescue after a quake in Turkey when a young boy came to tell them that another child was trapped under a collapsed building. That rescue took 16 hours, he said, and while the team worked, local women brought them trays of figs, apples and other refreshments. Professionally, Hessel said the work brought other satisfactions, such as using the crane-operating and welding skills he learned as a youth, and the specialized knowledge he acquired later about cement composition, air pockets and the tendency of rain to mask human scent. “I learned a lot from my dad, who owned a rigging and millwright company,” Hessel said. The team travels with heavy rigging equipment to lift concrete slabs and steel beams off trapped people but uses locally provided cranes and machinery. “We try to be as self-sufficient as possible so we won’t be a burden,” he added. “We bring our own tools, water, food, showers, tents — everything but fuel.” The team also flew to Nepal with six highly trained sniffer dogs: three Labrador retrievers, a German shepherd and two Belgian Malinois. They have been specially taught to react to the scents of live people but to ignore other odors, including food, animals and human cadavers. Despite the urgent and dangerous nature of their work, the dogs are encouraged to regard it as a form of play and are unaware that they are being sent to explore crannies too small and high-risk for humans. Their reward is the praise and affection of their handlers, whom they live with full-time. During a visit Friday to the canine team’s tent, each dog relaxed on a cot with his or her handler, enjoying belly rubs, rope pulls and other pastimes while waiting to be called for duty. The bonds between each dog and human were immediately evident. On one cot, Ron Sanders, 54, patted Pryse, 6, an energetic tan Labrador, who had shown off her agility and intelligence the previous day while exploring the ruins of a collapsed guesthouse after the Fairfax team helped Nepali police rescue a trapped teenage boy. “This is her first deployment,” said Sanders, who worked with older dogs in Haiti as well as during Hurricane Katrina and other crises. “She loves what she does — they all do.” Sanders said the dogs must learn to act independently because they cannot always see or hear commands from deep inside a collapsed site. On an adjacent cot, Chris Holmes, 39, rested with Cazo, 9, a black shepherd who was awarded a medal of valor last year from the D.C. government while searching a collapsed house and alerting Holmes that there was someone, unconscious but alive, trapped inside. Before that, they served twice together in Haiti. Across the tent, Elizabeth Chaney and her 6-year-old Malinois, Ventoux, were furiously wrestling over a pull toy. She described him as a fast, athletic dog who had been waiting for four years after finishing his training before finally being called up for his first international deployment last week. “Ventoux has been wanting this for a long time, and I’m so proud of him,” Chaney said. “We’re all proud of them. They have to spend 18 hours in a crate to get here, but like all the assets on our team, they are always ready to go.” Read more: Rescuers pull ‘miracle’ survivor from quake in Nepal’s capital In Nepal’s capital, plumes from pyres and pleas from quake survivors A ‘boom,’ a prayer and then terror as avalanche roared down Everest Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world	92	"[{""start"": 2748, ""end"": 2954, ""text"": ""Despite the urgent and dangerous nature of their work, the dogs are encouraged to regard it as a form of play and are unaware that they are being sent to explore crannies too small and high-risk for humans."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3874, ""end"": 4133, ""text"": ""On an adjacent cot, Chris Holmes, 39, rested with Cazo, 9, a black shepherd who was awarded a medal of valor last year from the D.C. government while searching a collapsed house and alerting Holmes that there was someone, unconscious but alive, trapped inside"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3297, ""end"": 3559, ""text"": ""On one cot, Ron Sanders, 54, patted Pryse, 6, an energetic tan Labrador, who had shown off her agility and intelligence the previous day while exploring the ruins of a collapsed guesthouse after the Fairfax team helped Nepali police rescue a trapped teenage boy."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3297, ""end"": 3558, ""text"": ""On one cot, Ron Sanders, 54, patted Pryse, 6, an energetic tan Labrador, who had shown off her agility and intelligence the previous day while exploring the ruins of a collapsed guesthouse after the Fairfax team helped Nepali police rescue a trapped teenage boy"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 3874, ""end"": 4133, ""text"": ""On an adjacent cot, Chris Holmes, 39, rested with Cazo, 9, a black shepherd who was awarded a medal of valor last year from the D.C. government while searching a collapsed house and alerting Holmes that there was someone, unconscious but alive, trapped inside"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	103	2023-03-18T16:52:04.359806Z	2023-03-18T16:52:04.359983Z	299.956
There were a few famous dogs, mascots like Rin Tin Tin and the less famous but nonetheless highly celebrated Stubby, who joined soldiers of the 102nd Infantry on the front lines in France during World War I. But it wasn’t until the last decade or so that the stories of canine warriors and the history of the U.S. war dog program was pieced together. Soldier dogs have emerged as the subjects of several books and articles, and most recently the Hollywood movie “Max,” released last Friday. Max is a fictional war dog, a Belgian Malinois, who served in the Afghanistan war with the Marines. When his handler is killed in action, the family of the fallen soldier then takes in the dog. The military has started to favor the Belgian Malinois breed, which has more durable hips and higher energy than German Shepherds, in selecting potential working military dogs. [MORE: A soldier and his combat dog both returned from Iraq with PTSD — and found support in each other] But back to Stubby, a stocky dog with a short tail, whose breed has been debated since he became famous. He came from Hartford, Conn. and was smuggled by a soldier onto a ship bound for France. Stubby started out as a mascot, the main role dogs played in the Great War, providing companionship and boosting morale for U.S. troops. Stubby went from mascot to war hero somewhat instinctually. He warned a group of sleeping soldiers of an impending gas attack, giving them enough time to put on their masks. He once acted as a sentry for the soldiers he was with, standing guard and biting a German infiltrator, detaining him long enough for soldiers to capture him. And he was wounded by shrapnel, but continued on with the 102nd, surviving several battles, according to Michael G. Lemish, a war dog historian and author. Known by then as “Sergeant Stubby,” the dog met three U.S. presidents — Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge — and after the war he toured the country, marching in parades and making appearances, according to Lemish, who spent years piecing together the disparate story of war dogs for his first book “War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism.” Other than mascots, the U.S. did not send dogs to World War I in an official capacity, unlike other countries, including Britain, France and Germany, which used thousands of dogs in World War I. The majority of the dogs were destroyed after the war but those countries continued to build up their canine resources. When the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl Harbor, U.S. military officials quickly realized they wanted to use dogs as their enemies did, but they had access to only about 50 sled dogs in Alaska. Patriotic civilian groups began organizing a campaign to have Americans donate their dogs for the war effort and ultimately 18,000 were accepted. The dog owners were told there was no guarantee their pets would return, but none of those dogs were euthanized after their service, according Lemish. The majority of them worked with the Coast Guard watching America’s shores, but several hundred served in Europe as sentry or search and rescue dogs. [MORE: Finding hope in a trash can: How a North Korean boy kept himself from starving and made it to America] When the war was over, they were either returned to their owners or adopted by their handlers. Keeping the dogs alive after their service in that war was a stark contrast to the fate of the 4,000 scout dogs sent to Vietnam. These canines were used to flush out the enemy by moving through the jungle and picking up the scent of North Vietnamese fighters. They could do this in part because of the difference between the way the opposing forces smelled: Americans ate a wheat-based diet, and Vietnamese ate a rice-based diet, said Lemish, who is working with filmmakers to raise money for a movie about a dog handler and his canine partner during the Vietnam War.                                                                                                                In America’s hasty exit from Vietnam, all but a few hundred of the scout dogs were euthanized or simply left behind, presumably to starve to death or be killed by North Vietnamese soldiers. There was no law stopping the military from killing dogs when they were done with them. But in 2000, President Bill Clinton signed “Robby’s Law,” named for a dog that was euthanized even after his handler notified his superiors that he desperately wanted to adopt Robby, according to Lemish and other historical accounts. The new law banned the military from putting dogs down after their service, and made it possible for civilians to adopt former war dogs. The dog’s handler, former handlers and law enforcement agencies were given priority to adopt the dogs. By the time the law passed, however, Robby was too sick to be adopted. Military officials said he was euthanized for humanitarian reasons. At least 650 dogs were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, according to military officials working with the U.S. war dog program based at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. The number does not include Special Forces dogs, which are not based there; information about those dogs is classified. Statistics on dogs killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan are also limited. According to Doug Miller, Department of Defense military working dog program manager, 44 of the 650 dogs that served in both conflicts died between 2005 and 2012. Each war was well underway by 2005, but the number of deaths in the previous years is not available, Miller said. With the two wars over, the number of military working dogs has decreased. The official count now is 1, 734 dogs stationed at all Department of Defense installations, in the U.S. and other countries. Meanwhile, adoptions of dogs who have served in the military — or candidates who did not make the cut during training — are on the rise, Miller said. The current waiting list to adopt a military dog is 1,200, up from 200 six years ago, he said. The adoptions themselves are free but transportation is not covered and neither are veterinary benefits, even for veterans who adopt the dogs, although advocates for war dogs are lobbying for a new law that would provide that coverage. There is at least one organization dedicated exclusively to caring for Special Operations dogs and preparing them for adoption. However, the Warrior Dog Foundation’s website currently says, “We have multiple dogs onsite who were combat heroes. They are un-adoptable because of combat stress related injuries.” Upon hearing how long the waiting list is to adopt from the military dog program, Lemish said he felt lucky to have adopted Lucy, a German shepherd, five years ago, from the war dog program at Lackland. Lucy was in training to be a military working dog, and she feverishly and successfully could locate the fake explosives planted to train the dogs to sniff out bombs. The only problem was that when Lucy found the simulated explosives, she was overjoyed that she had discovered new toys to play with. Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Stubby as a Pit Bull, but his breed is under debate.      Want more inspiration?

Two Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services K-9 dogs died from heat exhaustion last week when a vehicle’s air conditioner failed at the Baltimore City Detention Center. A bloodhound, Kojack, and Dingo, a Dutch Shepherd, were taking part in operations Tuesday to transfer prisoners from the facility ordered closed by Gov. Larry Hogan. “The dogs were in a car where the air-conditioning system malfunctioned,” said department spokesman Gerard Shields, adding that one dog died at the scene; the other died the next day. Both died from heat exhaustion, he said. The agency confirmed the deaths when The Baltimore Sun asked about the dogs. The department is investigating whether any policy or procedures were violated, Shields said. He did not know long the dogs had been in the car or how long the dogs had worked for the agency. “The handlers are very distraught,” Shields said. “These dogs provide an incredible service to the department in making our facilities safer. They are part of our department family.” Shields said the deaths didn’t happen Thursday — the day Stephen T. Moyer, the state corrections secretary, led a tour with reporters of the now-closed facility. Hogan ordered the Men’s Detention Center closed last month, and corrections officials moved the final detainees out last week. Kojack and Dingo were not the first dogs to die on duty this year. In April, a service dog died after a state vehicle caught fire on Interstate 68 in Allegany County en route to a Cumberland complex, the Associated Press reported. The dog had recently completed training for contraband detection and patrol.	89	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 540, ""text"": ""Two Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services K-9 dogs died from heat exhaustion last week when a vehicle’s air conditioner failed at the Baltimore City Detention Center.

Daniel Peabody loved his dogs. At least, that’s the way it looked to students whenever Peabody, a hulking and heavily tattooed school cop, strode into northern Georgia classrooms with a K-9 at his side. The lieutenant loved his animal partners so much that when one dog retired, Peabody promptly adopted him. But Peabody wasn’t the dog savior he portrayed himself to be, authorities say. Instead, the veteran K-9 officer now stands accused of leaving one police dog in a roasting car to die and executing another. On Tuesday, investigators announced that the remains of a third dog — unearthed in Peabody’s back yard — indicated the animal also had been shot, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The alleged case of animal cruelty is all the more bizarre because of the special protections police departments bestow on the expensive and highly trained animals. In Georgia, for instance, it is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to intentionally kill a K9 — a penalty stiffened just last year after a police dog was killed in the line of duty. Few in Cherokee County could have imagined that the biggest threat to a beloved police dog was the man holding its leash. The strange story dates to at least 2012, but only came to light last month. On June 10, Peabody and his pawed partner, Inca, a four-year-old Belgian Malinois, came home from work about 4:15 p.m. Peabody, a 16-year police veteran who had worked with K-9s for five years, rushed inside to deal with another dog, Cherokee County Marshal’s Office Maj. Jamie Gianfala told the Marietta Daily Journal. Nearly three hours later, Peabody suddenly remembered he had left Inca in his squad car. When Peabody went outside to check on the dog, she was dead, Gianfala said. Gianfala also said Peabody’s 2001 Ford Crown Victoria was not equipped for police dogs. “There’s no kennel, there’s no alarms,” he added. “It’s basically just a Crown Vic police car.” The temperature that afternoon was in the 90s, “and that was outside, so I’m sure the temperature in that police car was much higher,” added Chief Marshal Ron Hunton. Hunton told the Daily Journal that Peabody was visibly distraught over the dog’s death, hyperventilating so badly that he had to be taken to a hospital and passed out at one point. “He is very, very upset about the death of his dog,” Hunton said. A few days later, Peabody abruptly resigned, according to the Journal-Constitution. When authorities investigated Inca’s death, however, they quickly stumbled upon other suspicious incidents involving the K-9 officer and his partners. When they asked Peabody about Dale, a yellow lab he adopted in 2012 after five years of working alongside the animal, Peabody initially said the retired dog died in a freak accident. “Peabody initially claimed Dale’s death was accidental due to Dale choking on a toy,” the marshal’s office said in a statement, according to the Journal-Constitution. “However, the investigation yielded evidence that Dale was in fact shot and killed by Peabody at his Paulding County home.” On June 20, investigators executing a search warrant on Peabody’s former home in Paulding County unearthed the remains of a dog they suspected was Dale. Peabody was charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and making a false statement to investigators. His wife, Tyler Verlander, meanwhile, was cited for operating a dog boarding and training business without a Cherokee County occupation tax certificate, according to the Journal-Constitution. She was also charged with operating a boarding and training business inside a residential district and too close to a residential property. The charges are unrelated to the K-9 deaths. On Tuesday, investigators announced yet another twist in the curious case. A forensic veterinarian had determined that the dog remains did not, in fact, belong to Dale. Instead, they belonged to a Belgian Malinois — possibly Inca’s grandmother. The discovery brought to three the number of dogs Peabody is suspected of killing, although authorities say the development won’t affect charges facing the former school cop. Dale’s body remains unaccounted for.	88	"[{""start"": 388, ""end"": 513, ""text"": ""nstead, the veteran K-9 officer now stands accused of leaving one police dog in a roasting car to die and executing another."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 514, ""end"": 871, ""text"": ""On Tuesday, investigators announced that the remains of a third dog — unearthed in Peabody’s back yard — indicated the animal also had been shot, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

A black Labrador dog that works in a K-9 law enforcement unit has gone missing in the Woodbridge area of Virginia. Police in Prince William County said on their Facebook page that Milo was last seen about 7:45 p.m. Sunday in the 14100 block of Rahill Court. The dog ran away from his handler, police said, as the official was “returning home from work.” It was not known which federal agency Milo works for, officials said. Milo is described as a friendly dog and is “trained to work in and around people.” He is not aggressive, police said, and is rather shy. Milo may avoid contact at first, police said. He weighs about 50 pounds and has a small patch of white hair on his chest. He had on a choke collar with his service badge and a vaccination tag on it. He was also wearing a black nylon-strap harness that buckles across the top of his back, according to police.

Prince George’s County police put names and faces to a weekend of tragedies and heroics on Monday, identifying a man who killed a fellow dinner guest, another who was killed in a car crash, and a third subdued in dramatic fashion by a county police dog. Police say 18-year-old Jarhea Carter was behind a fatal stabbing of a dinner guest twice his age on Saturday night in the District Heights area. Carter was charged with second degree murder and manslaughter Sunday in the death of District resident Lamont Xaviar Fleet. His arrest was announced on Monday. Carter lives on the 3200 block of Prince Ranier Place where Fleet, 36, was found in a parking lot suffering from fatal stab wounds. County police said they were also investigating the death of a 26-year-old Accokeek man who initiated a series of collisions Sunday afternoon on Indian Head Highway in Fort Washington. Derico Cordora Lynch of the 900 block of Chatsworth Drive was behind the wheel of a Dodge Magnum, police say, when for some unknown reason he struck the side of a Mercedes Benz, crossed the median and struck a motorcycle and a pickup truck. The driver and a passenger of the truck were treated and released. Neither alcohol nor speed appeared to be factors, police said. The armed man who was tackled by a police dog with television cameras rolling was also identified as 31-year-old Othman Conteh of Adelphi. Police say Conteh was under the influence of the hallucinogenic drug PCP on Sunday when his erratic behavior led to a nine-hour stand-off with police. He destroyed several windows inside a home and then jumped from one about 11 feet off the ground in an apparent attempt to escape the barricade. A county police officer shot at Conteh and missed when he brandished a handgun. Conteh then ran about 100 yards through a residential area before a Prince George’s police dog nicknamed “Rambo” caught up with the suspect. “Rambo” latched on to Conteh’s shooting arm, forcing him to discharge the weapon, police said. In a statement, county police said Conteh suffered only minor injuries: “The gunman was taken to a local hospital for minor injuries to his arm sustained during the K9 seizure, and injuries to his hands sustained while destroying windows in his home.” Meanwhile, the domestic violence unit of the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Office announced the arrest of a Forestville woman, saying she attempted to murder a man Saturday with a butcher knife. Charnell Francis Grant used the knife to slash a man in the lower abdomen and then stashed the knife at a neighbor’s residence before deputies arrived, the department said. County fire investigators on Monday also named a suspect in a case of arson from Friday. Bowie resident Elijah Kareem Shahid, 40, used a flammable liquid to set multiple fires in his home 16300 block of Pewter Lane, authorities said.	86	"[{""start"": 1247, ""end"": 1385, ""text"": ""The armed man who was tackled by a police dog with television cameras rolling was also identified as 31-year-old Othman Conteh of Adelphi."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1762, ""end"": 1996, ""text"": ""onteh then ran about 100 yards through a residential area before a Prince George’s police dog nicknamed “Rambo” caught up with the suspect. “Rambo” latched on to Conteh’s shooting arm, forcing him to discharge the weapon, police said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1762, ""end"": 1996, ""text"": ""Conteh then ran about 100 yards through a residential area before a Prince George’s police dog nicknamed “Rambo” caught up with the suspect. “Rambo” latched on to Conteh’s shooting arm, forcing him to discharge the weapon, police said"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1247, ""end"": 1384, ""text"": ""he armed man who was tackled by a police dog with television cameras rolling was also identified as 31-year-old Othman Conteh of Adelphi"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	97	2023-03-18T15:23:44.485619Z	2023-03-18T15:23:44.485713Z	359.908
Children left in hot cars have made for tragic headlines this summer. Animals are also vulnerable when left with no way out — especially police dogs, who spend their days riding around with human partners. Example: A North Carolina deputy sheriff left a police dog in his patrol car overnight in August, and it died. Duplin County Sheriff Blake Wallace told WFMY News that it was a terrible accident. Deputy Kevin Williams was nearing the end of his shift when he got a call about his sick child, who needed to be picked up. The distracted deputy fed 5-year-old Kela, a Belgian Shepherd trained to track down narcotics, but forgot to take the dog out of his patrol car, Fox News reported. It was found dead the next morning. The sheriff said prosecutors decided not to bring charges because the death was an accident. After working with Kela for four years, Williams considered the dog his partner. He was devastated by the death, the sheriff said. Williams has been reassigned since the incident to serve as a courthouse bailiff. But some think he should be punished. “I just think it’s crazy, because they get on everyone else for leaving their animals in the car and dying, and they want to throw them in jail, but they can’t do nothing about their own officer that kills one of their K9s,” Michael Foss told ABC. Unfortunately, the tragic North Carolina incident isn’t the only case of a police dog dying from heat stroke after being left in a hot car. There were at least two other deaths in recent months, one in Wyoming and another in Arizona. A Mills, Wyo., police officer was charged with animal cruelty in August after leaving his partner, a black lab trained to sniff narcotics, locked in a hot car for more than six hours in July. According to the Star-Tribune, Officer Zachary Miller allegedly left the dog in the car in the cooler early morning hours with the windows rolled up and no air conditioning turned on, though the car was running. Meanwhile, the officer was inside the police station, where dogs are allowed, training another officer. By the time he returned to the car midday, the dog was dead. The dog, Nyx, lived with Miller’s family and had been with the department for seven years, the Billings Gazette reported. Miller pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was suspended with pay for a week by the department. Mills Police Chief Bryon Preciado told the Tribune that Nyx was the department’s only police dog, and that alarms that alert the dog’s human handlers when temperatures become unsafe would be installed in K9 patrol cars before they get another dog. Arizona police officer Jesse Dorantes left his dog in a police SUV for seven hours in April. He said he forgot the dog was in the car when he left in his personal vehicle to care for his sick child, KTAR reported. When he finally remembered and called his boss to check on the dog, the animal was dead. Prosecutors decided not to bring animal cruelty charges after reviewing a 2007 case involving a cop and a K9 in which the officer was acquitted. The Humane Society warns animals should never be left in a parked car — not even for a minute.	85	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 204, ""text"": ""n left in hot cars have made for tragic headlines this summer.

A police dog died after being dispatched to patrol the grounds of the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin on Wednesday, the Green Bay Press Gazette reported. Wix, a 3-year-old male Belgian Malinois, had been working with the Brown County Sheriff’s Office since April of last year. The cause of death is still being investigated, but a likely culprit is an air conditioning unit that malfunctioned while Wix was waiting in a patrol car. The lower motor that pushes the air supply is the component that failed, according to the sheriff’s office, which held a press conference on Thursday afternoon about the incident. The sheriff’s office said Wix’s partner, Deputy Austin Lemberger, checked on Wix in the morning, but when he later came back at around 12:30 p.m. CT, Wix was non-responsive in the back of the vehicle. That’s when the officer discovered the vehicle’s air conditioning unit wasn’t working properly and that the K-9 heat alarm had also failed, the sheriff’s office said, noting the alarm presented a second mechanical failure that is currently being investigated. It is unclear how hot Lemberger’s patrol car got. “Wix was a valuable member of this agency and community and will be sadly missed by all,” read a news release from the Sheriff’s Office. “Our thoughts are with Deputy Lemberger while he copes with the loss of his K-9 partner.” A representative of the sheriff’s office on Thursday likened Lemberger’s grief to losing a family member. Wix, one of five K-9 Unit dogs on the force, was an expert at tracking and explosives detection.	84	"[{""start"": 2, ""end"": 1090, ""text"": ""e dog died after being dispatched to patrol the grounds of the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin on Wednesday, the Green Bay Press Gazette reported.

In San Antonio, the din of awakening trainees pierced the quiet of a new day. The noise traveled uphill, to the parking lot of the main office, and penetrated the windows of a van carrying guests down to the yard. The commotion intensified as the vehicle drew closer to the barracks. As the passengers unloaded, a staff member handed out earplugs The residents barked, whined and pawed at the concrete walls and chain-link fencing. The winter classes of the Transportation Security Administration’s Canine Training Center at Lackland Air Force Base, which instructs up to 150 recruits, were ready to serve. They just needed someone to let them out. “Comin’ out,” a trainer hollered while leading a German shorthaired pointer outside. One by one, the instructors exited the kennels with their charges tight at their heels. “Coming by, coming by,” said another staffer, gripping a Belgian Malinois. The march of dogs continued: Weimaraners, German shepherds, Dutch shepherds, springer spaniels, retrievers of varied coat lengths and colors. “Stopping,” shouted an instructor holding a black Labrador. He guided the animal into an air-conditioned unit set on wheels — a mobile dog motel. The tag clipped to his door read: Bruno. The cubbies quickly filled up, and the trailers rattled off. The barking subsided. Calm returned. Dogs, dogs everywhere. Roaming through cruise ports, train stations, courthouses and college campuses. Appearing at Super Bowls, marathons and holiday parades. Inspecting vehicles in airport parking lots and planes on tarmac. Sniffing luggage and legs in security lines. In public settings around the country, dogs are becoming as ubiquitous as security cameras and as visible as X-ray machines. The dog — all wet nose and whiskers — is the new face of security. “There is no better overall detector of explosives than a dog’s nose,” TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger said. “Dogs work an environment like no technology can. They are versatile, mobile and very accurate.” John Ensminger, a lawyer and consultant on legal issues involving working dogs, said U.S. police departments employed about 5,200 dogs in 2000; the current figure has likely doubled. TSA has also been beefing up its K-9 brigade. Since 2011, the number of explosives-detection canines has grown by 25 percent, from about 800 to 1,000. The Penn Vet Working Dog Center, which opened on Sept. 11, 2012, in Philadelphia, focuses on research, breeding and training detection dogs, and advises law enforcement and federal agencies on how to best exploit their canine resources. Ninety percent of its graduates are employed in such fields as search and rescue; narcotics, explosives and bedbug detection; and diabetes alert. The other alumni are pursuing therapy support and ovarian cancer detection. Cindy Otto, executive director of the center, envisions dogs branching out to cinemas, schools and private security firms. Could a dog have even stopped the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando? “Explosives-detection dogs will often detect pistols and other small weapons,” said Ensminger. “Assuming that the shooter had entered at a door when a dog was working there, it is quite likely he would have been stopped.” In these anxious times, dogs could have a twofold impact on potential terrorist attacks: deterrence and detection. “It’s time to start thinking about deploying these dogs in different ways,” Otto said. Looking toward the future, will the new world order resemble a Planet ofthe Dogs, where humans pass through a phalanx of canine noses to enter event venues and ride mass transit? Will dogs supplant scanners and swabs? Do dogs, which have stood by mankind’s side for at least 15,000 years, represent the next generation of scientific innovations? “We refer to dogs as real-time mobile detection technology,” said Craig Angle, co-director of the Canine Performance Sciences Program at Auburn University’s College of Veterinary Medicine in Alabama. The program, which competes for government contracts and grants, developed methods for dogs to find improvised explosive devices with the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory and patented Vapor Wake technology. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority and Amtrak police departments were the first to adopt the latter practice of using dogs to track suspicious odors on moving targets. The researchers are currently studying virus detection: Imagine a canine identifying Ebola on an individual entering the country. “The dog is the gold standard,” said Paul Waggoner, also a co-director at the Alabama center. “We are not in our lifetime close to emulating a dog’s nose.” TSA’s National Explosives Detection Canine Team Program, which the Federal Aviation Administration founded in 1972, is the government’s second-largest dog-training program. (The Department of Defense ranks first.) The Lackland-based facility prepares dogs and handlers for service with TSA, the Federal Protective Service, the U.S. Coast Guard and Amtrak. Nearly 1,000 six-legged teams safeguard more than 100 airports, mass transit stations and cargo-hold sites. The agencies assign the dogs to spots with the heaviest passenger volume and greatest potential risks. In May, TSA relocated the animals to some of the country’s busiest airports, such as Chicago O’Hare, Newark and Atlanta, to handle the surge in summer travel. About 230 canines graduate from Lackland annually, and Neffenger has secured funding for additional teams next year. The agency will need to acquire and train the dogs, expand its chest of toys and tennis balls, and sign up more handlers. TSA fields candidates internally and from the U.S. military, law enforcement agencies and private sector organizations. No prior dog experience is required, though many résumés include explosives-detection work during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. All handlers attend a 12-week basic training course, where they meet their partners-in-security. “It’s essentially a big game,” Neffenger said, “but a game that has dangerous consequences if it’s not played right.” The agency has also expanded its areas of oversight. Travelers are one of the newest fragrances. Previously, the dogs focused on static objects: cargo, luggage and vehicles. Five years ago, the agency created a passenger-screening canine division. The animals added ambulatory targets to their hunt for dangerous material, such as the businesswoman hustling to her gate or the backpacker gliding through the checkpoint line. “The dogs are a visible deterrence factor and a disruption,” Neffenger said. “They also calm the whole screening environment. Animals are inherently fascinating to watch.” From the outside, Lab 7 at Lackland resembles a warehouse that might house secrets — a fleet of world-dominating drones, perhaps. The featureless exterior, absent windows and signage, didn’t yield any clues. No sound escaped the heavy metal door. But once inside, any preconceived notions of covert operations evaporated when a pup named Bator bounded for a tennis ball, which released a mousy squeak. The canines start explosives-detection training with basic skills courses held in controlled settings like Lab 7. Over 35 to 37 weeks of instruction, they will progress to advanced-level challenges staged in mock environments — fuselages, railway cars, airport terminals, a parking lot — constructed on the base. In the final phase, they will embark on field trips to real venues with real dangers, such as malls and the San Antonio airport. “We’re preparing them for the bad guy,” said Diana Thomas, a training instructor. On an early March morning, the dogs at Lab 7 were about three weeks into their training — still grunts. The exercises were rudimentary, the canine version of playing with wooden alphabet blocks. The instructors started by planting the material at snout level. Barbara Black-Diaz, a handler, led Bator to a medium-high wall pocked with holes. The German shorthaired pointer poked his nose into the spaces as if it were a carnival game. Halfway down the line, a scent grabbed his attention. He sat down, signaling a find. Black-Diaz tossed him his prize. Chad Perraut took his trainee, Dory, into an adjoining room furnished with airplane seats. The Munsterlander snuffled the orange cushions. She followed a methodical flow — seat by seat, row by row. She scooted up onto a seat and pushed her nose under the cushion. She hopped back down and sat. “Woo-hoo, there it is!” Perraut exclaimed in a who’s-a-good-doggie voice. “You’re going to save the world!” Perraut next tested Dory in a series of chambers rife with distractions, such as stacked furniture and idling strangers. In a faux hotel room, Dory uncovered hazardous material stashed in a nightstand. In Rooms 2 and 4, she exited without a positive whiff (not finding is as crucial as finding). In Room 3, she exposed an item tucked inside a credenza. In the final room, she poked around a man reading a “Star Wars” book before exposing the goods inside the pencil drawer of a desk. “She’s a sweetheart,” Perraut said as Dory attacked her Wubba dog toy. “She’s going to be the face of TSA.” Over the next few months, she would set her nose loose in the small baggage lab, which resembled a lost-and-found closet, and in the cargo lab, a jumble of boxes and bags piled high on shelves and stuffed in circus wagons. She would scour planes, trains and cars. If all went well, she could sniff her way through a demanding career that could last through middle age, in dog years. “I look at these animals like pro athletes,” said Rob Grauel, a lead training instructor. “They have to keep practicing and practicing.” In the “terminal,” the sprawling space pulsated with the frenetic energy of a real airport. Classic rock tunes blared over the speakers. A woman read on a Kindle; two actor-passengers chatted softly. Individuals would suddenly bolt out of their seats. An information board posted arriving and departing flights. The 10:05 a.m. to Dallas was canceled. There was no shortage of verisimilitude. In spite of the hubbub, Caki moved as though he were inhabiting his own soundproof bubble. The German shorthair inspected one gate area, cut through the cafe and beelined for a back row in a second waiting section. He pinned his focus on a woman in a purple shirt. She strutted off, but Caki wouldn’t let the perpetrator — or the explosives concealed beneath her pant leg — get away. The team repeated the exercise with a slight modification: This time, Caki would work the security line. The passengers snaked their way to the ticket counter; each person passed Caki without incident. Then the woman in purple approached. Busted again. Canines arrive on the job with the proper equipment. They breathe through the center of their nostrils and smell from the sides via an olfactory express lane. They possess a chamber in their nasal cavity that collects odors like a perfume bottle. Their olfactory bulb, the neural tissue responsible for processing scents, is about 40 times as large as a human’s. They also know how to communicate. “Vultures may be great,” said Otto of Penn Vet WDC, “but they don’t care.” Otto says dogs smell in color, yet a nose is not always enough. The animals need a companion who acts as coach and cheerleader. “It’s not as simple as you wait for the dog to sit and then you pay him,” said Sasha Garcia, a handler at the San Jose International Airport in California. “It can be pretty overwhelming reading the behavior of the animal and learning how to walk backward so you can watch the dog and not hit anything.” As the connection grows between dog and handler, the duo learns to transmit a secret language, like spouses or twins. While patrolling an area, the handler must read the animal’s cues, which often manifest as slight behavioral changes, such as raised ears or a closed mouth. But the partnership is not equal; the dog’s hunches usually trump the human’s. “There’s a saying: Trust your dog,” said Annemarie DeAngelo, training director at Penn Vet WDC. “Dogs don’t lie.” As an example, DeAngelo recalled a case from her time as a New Jersey state police officer. The other cops on the scene had told her that a suspicious tractor-trailer was clear of drugs. Her partner didn’t agree. Buster uncovered 1,200 kilograms of cocaine. “Any challenge you place in front of them, they are capable of doing,” she said, “if you explain it to them properly.” In Australia, authorities rely on canines to uncover illegal shipments of firearms attempting to enter the country. In the United States, AMK9, a private company specializing in canine security, has Vapor Wake dogs capable of exposing weapons secreted away on bodies and inside bags. (The firm also deploys dogs to prisons, where they root out contraband cellphones.) Auburn University’s team is looking beyond present dangers to future menaces. The researchers want to learn how dogs can identify emerging threats, both naturally occurring and cruelly triggered. “Too often, security-related technologies, especially the use of dogs for detection, are only of interest in the moment of a tragedy or an immediate threat,” said Waggoner, the program co-director. Otto noted a separate wave of innovation: liberating the dogs so that they can work more independently. The handler, minus the leash, will direct the animal via cameras and radio. “The handler will have less influence on the dog and will communicate remotely,” she said. For now, however, the handlers are bound to their partners — in more ways than one. Garcia, the California handler, spent eight years working with Truck, a Hungarian vizsla-Labrador mix. She sent out clear signals that the dog was not a household plaything. Truck slept in a kennel outside, and Garcia hid him in the garage when friends visited so they wouldn’t baby him. She banned her husband from pet-care duties. After Truck retired at age 8, she didn’t consider keeping him and planned to train with a new canine. Then her heart flipped. “I can’t give this dog up,” she said. “He’s never been a dog.” She paused as the emotion welled. “I’m the only life he’s known for the last eight years. Just because I don’t treat him like a pet, he’s still my best friend and he’s loyal to me. I know that I am responsible for him.” After her decision to adopt, she told her husband he could now feed and walk the dog. Some uninformed observers might bristle at the idea of a working dog’s life. They might assume that the dog would prefer to spend the day lounging on a sheepskin bed or frolicking with friends in the park instead of putting in grueling hours at the office. But countless canines live to labor. “It can be hard for the average dog owner to see stuff like that,” said Kenny Lamberti, a companion animal expert at the Humane Society of the United States. Among animal-rights advocates, the central concern is quality of life. The animals also require frequent interaction with humans. Hugs and behind-the-ear scratches are good for the head and heart. “It is important for the dog to have a family life and socialization,” said Vicki Berkowitz, Penn Vet WDC’s associate director. “They need to be a well-rounded dog.” Sentiments aside, the dogs are an expensive investment; TSA budgets $25,000 to $36,000 per dog, including purchase, training and upkeep. The meter starts running in Europe. Most U.S. agencies and departments draft dogs from Old World breeders, who have a longer history and deeper experience with bloodlines than their Yankee counterparts. (During World War II, the U.S. military implored citizens to donate their pets to Dogs for Defense; thousands complied.) However, over the years, the heightened demand has elevated the cost while diminishing the quality. Otto hopes to organize a summit this fall to discuss creating a national breeding program. “We see the threat of not having control of our own national security program,” she said. TSA carefully monitors the health and wellness of its pack. Once a month, the dogs and handlers — 650 pairs in early March — meander down to the Holland Military Working Dog Hospital at Lackland AFB for heartworm pills and flea and tick prevention treatments. Every six months, they return for a more thorough physical. Heavy exertion — jumping, crouching, climbing — makes the animals prone to elbow and hip dysplasia as well as spinal troubles, such as degenerative lumbosacral stenosis, or compression of the spinal cord. Small lacerations are also common, especially on paws. The attack dogs are even rougher on their bodies. The more hyper canines sometimes spin like tornadoes, thwacking their tails against hard objects. The 32-“bed” institution is as sophisticated as a people infirmary. A dozen clinical specialists tend to most maladies, from root canals to behavioral issues. The rehab department is even outfitted with underwater treadmills and therapy pools. The vets treat government-owned animals as well as dogs referred by clinical residents at military veterinary treatment facilities around the country and at international bases. One dog had been flown in from Guantanamo Bay. Andres Lopez, a San Antonio airport police officer, had dropped Cora off for a CT scan. The Belgian Malinois suffered from an achy leg. Lopez fidgeted during the wait. To pass the time, he showed a guest photos on his phone. There was Cora seated in a field of bluebonnets and the pair posing in front of the Alamo. “There’s no off button,” he said. “She’s like a rabbit. She’s always on the go. Even with her leg bothering her, she still wants to work.” Until Cora’s recovery, Lopez was down a partner. And the world was a little less safe. Andrea Sachs is a Washington Post staff writer.
