"The morass of conflicting information about e-cigarettes and tobacco use grew deeper Monday, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a new study showing that adolescents who vape say they are much more likely to smoke conventional cigarettes. The results show that 43.9 percent of sixth- through 12th-graders who had used e-cigarettes said they intended to light up conventional cigarettes over the next year, compared with 21.5 percent of youth who had never used the electronic nicotine delivery systems. Overall, more than 263,000 adolescents who had never smoked before used e-cigarettes in 2013, up from 79,000 in 2011, the CDC reported in a study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research. The data come from the agency's National Youth Tobacco Surveys for 2011-2013. The study also showed that 21.9 percent of the youth who had never smoked traditional cigarettes intended to give them a try in the next year -- almost exactly the same proportion as the 21.5 percent who had never tried an e-cigarette -- and that, overall, the percentage of youths who reported an intention to smoke declined ""significantly"" in the 2013 survey. While there is no doubt that smoking tobacco is one of the worst things you can do for your health, there is debate about whether e-cigarettes promote cigarette use or can help prevent it by offering people access to nicotine-laced vapor without the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Others claim that e-cigaretttes may help wean smokers off tobacco, for the same reason. In April, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to regulate e-cigarettes for the first time since they came to the United States in 2006. This November, 2013 study in the Lancet, concluded that ""E-cigarettes, with or without nicotine, were modestly effective at helping smokers to quit, with similar achievement of abstinence as with nicotine patches, and few adverse events."" Sally Satel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction even argued here that promoting e-cigarettes should be a ""public health priority,"" free of taxes and with easily accessible starter kits. Perhaps, she says, that will make a dent in the $130 billion we spend every year on medical costs related to smoking. Just about everyone agrees these issues need more study. The CDC is not interested in kids dipping their toes in those waters. ""We are very concerned about nicotine use among our youth, regardless of whether it comes from conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes or other tobacco products,"" Tim McAfee, director of the agency's Office on Smoking and Health, said in a news release that accompanied the study. ""The increasing number of young people who use e-cigarettes should be a concern for parents...since youth e-cigarette users were nearly twice as likely to have intentions to smoke conventional cigarettes,"" added Rebecca Bunnell, associate director of the same office and lead author of the study. (I'm waiting to talk with McAfee or Bunnell and will update this post when they get back to me. Update: Neither was available Monday, and we have moved on to other matters.). With tobacco and e-cig companies marketing heavily to young people, and 80 percent of cigarette smokers starting the habit by age 18, the CDC considers intervening with this age group critical.

"The number of middle and high school students using electronic cigarettes tripled between 2013 and 2014, according to government figures released Thursday, a startling increase that public health officials fear could reverse decades of efforts combating the scourge of smoking. The use of e-cigarettes among teenagers has eclipsed the use of traditional cigarettes and all other tobacco products, a development that Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called “alarming” and “shocking.” “What’s most surprising is how in­cred­ibly rapid the use of products other than cigarettes has increased,” Frieden said in an interview, adding that some e-cigarette smokers would undoubtedly go on to use traditional cigarettes. “It is subjecting another generation of our children to an addictive substance.” The results, based on an annual survey of 22,000 students around the country and published Thursday by the CDC, detail a quickly evolving landscape of tobacco products that appeal to teenagers. Anti-smoking advocates argue that the rise in the popularity of e-cigarettes stems in part from aggressive, largely unregulated marketing campaigns that Frieden said are “straight out of the playbook” of cigarette ads that targeted young people in earlier generations. [FDA outlines plan to regulate e-cigarettes] “These are the same images, the same themes and the same role models that the cigarette industry used 50 years ago,” said Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “It’s the Marlboro Man reborn. It’s the Virginia Slims woman recreated, with the exact same effect. ... This is not an accident.” But advocates of e-cigarettes -- small devices that heat up flavored, nicotine-laced liquid into a vapor that is inhaled -- say the worries expressed by public health officials are premature and not backed up by data. Cynthia Cabrera, executive director of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, an industry group, said her organization has long supported age restrictions and other measures to keep e-cigarettes out of the hands of minors. But at the same time, she said there’s no definitive evidence e-cigarettes are a “gateway” to using traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products. On the contrary, she said, many teens have tried e-cigarettes in the past already were smokers. “We need to not lose perspective about the potential these products have to eliminate harm from combusted tobacco,” she said. “I suspect teens experiment with a lot of things. And I suspect anytime someone is not smoking a cigarette, that’s a good thing.” “The CDC should really be jumping for joy at the fact that smoking rates are declining. This is a huge success,” added Michael Siegel, a professor and tobacco control specialist at Boston University’s School of Public Health. “Instead, they are using this as another opportunity to demonize e-cigarettes.” Siegel said he agrees that minors shouldn’t have access to any tobacco product. But he said the CDC numbers suggest that rather than serving as a gateway to cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use might be diverting teens from traditional cigarettes, which still kill hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. “That’s a good thing,” he said. [CDC ads target vaping for first time] While tobacco giants such as Lorillard and Altria have indeed purchased e-cigarette companies in recent years, Cabrera disputed that those marketing campaigns target underage smokers. And she said the bulk of e-cigarette marketing is still done by hundreds of small companies whose ads on the internet and other platforms target only adults. “If you’re thinking this is Big Tobacco redux, that’s the wrong thinking,"" she said. This much seems certain: Teens are experimenting as much as ever. Roughly a quarter of high school students and near 8 percent of middle school students still report using a tobacco product at least once during the past 30 days. But between 2013 and 2014, the findings show, e-cigarette use among high school students had increased from 4.5 percent to 13.4 percent. Usage also more than tripled among middle school students, according to the findings. Only  among black students was another tobacco product, cigars, more popular than e-cigarettes, the CDC said. During that same period, the use of hookahs — water pipes that are used to smoke specially made tobacco — roughly doubled for middle and high school students, also eclipsing the use of regular cigarettes. [Seven things to know about e-cigarettes] Meanwhile, use of conventional cigarettes sank to the lowest levels in years. According to the CDC, 9.2 percent of high school students and 2.5 percent of middle school students reported smoking a cigarette over the past month. On the surface, that might seems like good news, given the hundreds of thousands of Americans that still die from smoking each year. And it might be. “The drop in cigarette use is historic, with enormous public health significance,” Myers said. But, he was quick to add, “the explosion of e-cigarette use among kids means these products are being taken up in record numbers with totally unknown long-term consequences that could potentially undermine all the progress we’ve made.” Last April, the Food and Drug Administration announced that for the first time it would begin to regulate e-cigarettes, which has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry in the United States. The agency said its plan would force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, place health warning labels on their products and disclose the ingredients in e-cigarettes. The initial proposals stopped short of halting online sales of e-cigarettes, restricting television advertising or banning the use of candy and fruit flavorings that critics say are intended to appeal to young smokers. A year later, the FDA has not finalized any new regulations involving e-cigarettes, though its top tobacco officials said in a statement Thursday the agency still plans to oversee the burgeoning market. “In today’s rapidly evolving tobacco marketplace, the surge in youth use of novel products like e-cigarettes forces us to confront the reality that the progress we have made in reducing youth cigarette smoking rates is being threatened,” said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “These staggering increases in such a short time underscore why FDA intends to regulate these additional products to protect public health.” Myers said such action can't come soon enough. ""The failure of the FDA to move more quickly means we have an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed,"" he said. ""In the absence of strong governmental action, these numbers will only keep going up."""	242	"[{""start"": 524, ""end"": 752, ""text"": ""What’s most surprising is how in­cred­ibly rapid the use of products other than cigarettes has increased,” Frieden said in an interview, adding that some e-cigarette smokers would undoubtedly go on to use traditional cigarettes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1028, ""end"": 1295, ""text"": ""Anti-smoking advocates argue that the rise in the popularity of e-cigarettes stems in part from aggressive, largely unregulated marketing campaigns that Frieden said are “straight out of the playbook” of cigarette ads that targeted young people in earlier generations"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1028, ""end"": 1295, ""text"": ""Anti-smoking advocates argue that the rise in the popularity of e-cigarettes stems in part from aggressive, largely unregulated marketing campaigns that Frieden said are “straight out of the playbook” of cigarette ads that targeted young people in earlier generations"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 5002, ""end"": 5237, ""text"": ""But, he was quick to add, “the explosion of e-cigarette use among kids means these products are being taken up in record numbers with totally unknown long-term consequences that could potentially undermine all the progress we’ve made."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5002, ""end"": 5237, ""text"": ""But, he was quick to add, “the explosion of e-cigarette use among kids means these products are being taken up in record numbers with totally unknown long-term consequences that could potentially undermine all the progress we’ve made.”"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 6521, ""end"": 6632, ""text"": ""The failure of the FDA to move more quickly means we have an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed,\"" he said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6521, ""end"": 6632, ""text"": ""The failure of the FDA to move more quickly means we have an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed,\"" he said"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2833, ""end"": 2912, ""text"": ""“Instead, they are using this as another opportunity to demonize e-cigarettes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5600, ""end"": 5818, ""text"": ""The initial proposals stopped short of halting online sales of e-cigarettes, restricting television advertising or banning the use of candy and fruit flavorings that critics say are intended to appeal to young smokers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	251	2023-03-27T14:35:08.584211Z	2023-03-28T06:38:52.032969Z	820.987
The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that it intends for the first time regulate the booming market of electronic cigarettes, as well as an array of other products such as cigars, pipe tobacco and hookahs. The move would begin to place restrictions on e-cigarettes, a nearly $2 billion industry that for years has operated outside the reach of federal regulators. If adopted, the government’s plan would force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, stop handing out free samples, place health warning labels on their products and disclose the ingredients. Makers of e-cigarettes also would be banned from making health-related claims without scientific evidence. The FDA’s proposal stops short of broader restrictions sought by many­ ­tobacco-control advocates. Regulators at this point are not seeking to halt online sales of e-cigarettes, curb television advertising, or ban the use of flavorings such as watermelon, grape soda and piña colada — all tactics that critics say are aimed at attracting young smokers and that have been banned for traditional cigarettes. Those restrictions might come eventually, FDA officials said, but not before more rigorous research can establish a scientific basis for tougher rules. “Right now, for something like e-cigarettes, there are far more questions than answers,” said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. He said Thursday’s action is about expanding FDA’s authority to products that have been “rapidly evolving with no regulation whatsoever,” in order to create a foundation for broader regulation in the future, adding, “It creates the framework. We’re calling this the first step. . . . For the first time, there will be a science-based, independent regulatory agency playing a vital gate-keeping function.” E-cigarettes vary from brand to brand, but they generally resemble the size and shape of traditional cigarettes. Instead of burning tobacco, the battery-powered devices heat up flavored, nicotine-laced liquid, turning it into a vapor that the user inhales, or “vapes.” Supporters say that makes e-cigarettes an attractive alternative to their ­cancer-causing tobacco counterparts. Congress passed a law in 2009 giving the FDA broad power to regulate cigarettes, including requirements for new warning labels, restrictions on ads and explicit approval of new products. The law also gave the FDA the authority to broaden its jurisdiction over other tobacco-related products. While the agency has indicated for years that it planned to do just that, action has been slow in coming. Reactions to Thursday’s announcement from the e-cigarette industry, public health officials and consumer advocates was swift — and mixed. Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the FDA’s action an important step but said that it is “inexcusable” that the agency had taken so long to act. “In the absence of any meaningful regulation, the e-cigarette manufacturers have acted as if it’s the wild, wild West, with no rules and no restraints,” Myers said. “Their advertising is exactly the same type of advertising that made cigarettes so appealing to young people” decades ago. He said FDA needs to move quickly to finalize Thursday’s proposal and conduct the scientific research it will need to put more stringent rules in place down the road on marketing practices and flavors. “They can’t move forward at the same pace that they have been moving and do their job protecting public health,” Myers said. “We can’t waste another five years; this cannot take that long. There is a moral and public health imperative for them to treat this with the urgency it deserves.” Still, whatever changes are coming won’t happen overnight. The public will have 75 days to comment on the proposal. After the FDA sorts through a likely tidal wave of responses and finalizes its regulations, companies will have to begin complying almost immediately with the proposed age and identification restrictions. But they will have two years to submit applications to the FDA to approve their products, which can remain on the market in the meantime. The FDA’s effort to begin overseeing the sprawling e-cigarette market comes at a critical time. Sales have doubled year after year, with no signs of slowing, according to some industry analysts. That pales in comparison with the estimated $80 billion-a-year U.S. market for conventional tobacco products, but the gap is shrinking steadily. In addition, tobacco giants such as Lorillard, Reynolds and Altria have entered the ­e-cigarette market in recent years, joining hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Some industry advocates worried Thursday that federal regulation will benefit only a handful of those large companies, who have established distribution channels and the money and manpower needed to file the streams of paperwork that will now be required to seek FDA approval of all e-cigarette products. “This is worse than I expected,” said Greg Conley, a board member of the American Vaping Association, who said he welcomed the age-restriction rules but had hoped the FDA would grandfather in existing products, rather than force e-cigarette makers to file lengthy applications for any product on the market dating to early 2007. “A lot of these companies, they are supporting several employees, investing any profits back into their buisness ... They can’t afford this, and it’s going to lead to a whole lot of consolidation and increased prices for consumers.” Not everyone in the e-cigarette industry bristled at Thursday's proposal. Indeed, some of the larger players in the e-cigarette market praised FDA for committing to a science-based regulatory process, which they hope will allow them to make a strong case that e-cigarettes have the potential to reduce tobacco-related harm and be an overall positive for public health. “What they did today was very encouraging ... We’ve already done many things to prepare ourselves and act responsibly,” said Miguel Martin, president of Logic Technology Development one of the nation’s leading e-cigarette companies. “At least speaking for my company, this will not be the tobacco wars of the 80s and 90s.” The move toward federal regulation comes amid an impassioned debate over simple questions that so far have no simple answer: Will e-cigarettes eventually cause more people or fewer to smoke? Will the devices emerge as a healthier alternative that makes cigarettes obsolete, or will they act as a gateway to smoking and undermine a half-century of efforts to reduce tobacco-related deaths, which still kill an estimated 480,000 Americans annually? “There’s such a huge debate over whether e-cigarettes are a good thing or a bad thing for public health,” said Kenneth Warner, a tobacco researcher and professor of public health at the University of Michigan. “But we’re in a kind of factual vacuum. There are not that many [reliable] studies. . . . We really don’t know the right answer.” Warner said the FDA will have to walk a fine line in the way it treats e-cigarettes. On one hand, the agency must set reasonable ­restrictions, such as keeping ­nicotine-delivery devices out of the hands of minors and creating safe manufacturing standards. On the other hand, if e-cigarettes do hold the potential to help some people quit smoking, the agency doesn’t want to stymie innovation and crush an industry that’s quickly evolving. “It’s a tricky balance,” Warner said. “Even in an environment devoid of politics and lawsuits, it would be a challenge to come up with the right mix of regulations. . . . Figuring out how to do this is going to be hard, and it isn’t going to happen quickly.” The cigar and e-cigarette industries have long been preparing for the inevitability of federal regulation — and working hard to try to shape it. For example, makers of “premium cigars” have been lobby­ing intensely not to be lumped in with the fruit-flavored corner-store varieties that public health experts say target kids — a distinction FDA officials have said they are willing to consider. E-cigarette executives have been every bit as aggressive, making their case over the past year in meetings with FDA regulators, members of Congress, and state and local officials, seeking to avoid some of the stringent rules that govern conventional cigarettes. In essence, they have argued that ­e-cigarettes vapor is far less harmful than cigarette smoke, with its cancer-causing toxins, and can actually help smokers kick the habit. Therefore, the manufacturers say, they should be subject to kinder, gentler oversight — and lower taxes — than traditional cigarettes. At the same time, manufacturers have been fighting growing regulation in cities and states. Numerous cities, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Boston, have banned e-cigarettes in public places, and dozens of state attorneys general have urged federal regulators to speed up restrictions on marketing the devices to young people. The e-cigarette industry also has faced questions about the safety and accessibility of its products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this month that calls to poison centers involving e-cigarettes have surged in recent years as the products have gained in popularity, with most of the incidents involving children younger than 6 who have accidentally ingested the liquid nicotine. Last year, the CDC reported a dramatic increase in the number of high school students who said they had tried e-cigarettes, including some who had never smoked. That fueled concerns among some public health officials that the devices could lead users toward traditional smoking. E-cigarette advocates argue there’s little evidence to support such a claim. According to the FDA, hard evidence will be key from now on. People on every side of the argument agreed that reliable research should dictate how the FDA regulates e-cigarettes going forward, even as what that research will show remains a source of disagreement. “It will move from theory and conjecture and gut feelings to a science-based regulatory framework,” said Jason Healy, founder and president of blu eCigs, which was acquired by Lorillard in 2012. “Both sides have to now be accountable for their statements. You’re going to have to put science behind it.” However that ends up shaping the industry, Healy said, that approach ultimately could prove positive for consumers. “There’s been so much uncertainty,” he said. “Now, everyone will know where we stand.” More from The Washington Post: Seven things about e-cigarettes Consider this before you ‘vape’ Big Tobacco tries to hook a new generation The Post’s View: E-cigarettes have risks but offer benefits	241	"[{""start"": 2712, ""end"": 2892, ""text"": ""Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the FDA’s action an important step but said that it is “inexcusable” that the agency had taken so long to ac"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 772, ""end"": 1077, ""text"": ""Regulators at this point are not seeking to halt online sales of e-cigarettes, curb television advertising, or ban the use of flavorings such as watermelon, grape soda and piña colada — all tactics that critics say are aimed at attracting young smokers and that have been banned for traditional cigarettes"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3994, ""end"": 4131, ""text"": ""But they will have two years to submit applications to the FDA to approve their products, which can remain on the market in the meantime."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3994, ""end"": 4130, ""text"": ""But they will have two years to submit applications to the FDA to approve their products, which can remain on the market in the meantime"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 5271, ""end"": 5502, ""text"": ""A lot of these companies, they are supporting several employees, investing any profits back into their buisness ...

While at least 55 countries have prohibited or restricted the sale of e-cigarettes, they have remained largely unregulated in the United States. That is slated to change this year, as the Food and Drug Administration plans to begin regulating “vaporized nicotine products,” or VNPs —by taking such steps as preventing manufacturers from luring kids with edgy ads or flavored e-cigs. But seven prominent tobacco experts writing in Addiction, a journal of the Society for the Study of Addiction, are trying to get ahead of the rules, urging regulators to keep a more open mind and take a restrained approach to e-cig regulation. The lengthy article — labeled “For Debate” — was written by top researchers from five universities in the United States, Canada and Australia, plus the Truth Initiative (the tobacco-control nonprofit formerly called the American Legacy Foundation). They present a detailed analysis of who uses e-cigs, how people start using e-cigs and how long they do it, along with a framework for using such data to carefully structure targeted legislation. The tone is measured and cautious: “The evidence suggests a strong potential for VNP use to improve population health by reducing or displacing cigarette use in countries where cigarette prevalence is high and smokers are interested in quitting” is about as strong as the article gets. But the lead author, David. T. Levy of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University, spoke more directly about vaping in a university press release. “We believe that the discussion to date has been slanted against e-cigarettes,” Levy says in a press release about the journal piece. “We’re concerned the FDA, which has asserted its right to regulate e-cigarettes, will focus solely on the possibility that e-cigarettes and other vapor nicotine products might act as a gateway to cigarette use,” Levy says. This is unfortunate, he continues, because “these products appear to be used mostly by people who already are or who are likely to become cigarette smokers.” Several days after the Addiction article appeared online, a major British medical organization chimed in: The Royal College of Physicians issued a paper that said, “Large-scale substitution of e-cigarettes, or other non-tobacco nicotine products, for tobacco smoking has the potential to prevent almost all the harm from smoking in society.”	258	"[{""start"": 1358, ""end"": 2042, ""text"": ""But the lead author, David.

Chances are good that you’ve seen people “smoking” e-cigarettes: inhaling from cigarette-shaped devices, then puffing out clouds of odorless fog. E-cigarettes, also known as e-cigs or electronic nicotine delivery systems, have been on the market for about a decade and are surging in popularity. But there’s widespread disagreement about their safety or any benefits they may have. Proponents say that e-cigs, a $2.8 billion market in the United States, are potentially less harmful than conventional cigarettes and can help smokers quit. Critics say that their safety hasn’t been proved and that it’s too soon to know what the long-term effects of “vaping” (inhaling the vapor) may be. Consumer Reports spoke with medical experts and reviewed more than 50 scientific studies to find out what’s known. How they work A typical battery-operated e-cigarette contains a cartridge of e-cig liquid, or juice, which usually contains nicotine and the chemical propylene glycol. The juices come in an array of flavors including cola and watermelon, which some say are meant to attract younger users. When used, the battery powers an atomizer that vaporizes the liquid in the cartridge for the user to inhale. Aside from those basics, e-cigarettes vary widely in terms of ingredients, construction and factors such as battery voltage. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates regular cigarettes, has proposed regulating e-cigarettes more tightly, but some politicians and many in the industry oppose the FDA’s plan. The nicotine issue Juice from e-cigarettes has different amounts of the addictive stimulant nicotine, from zero to about 72 milligrams per milliliter of liquid. (A traditional cigarette has 10 to 15 milligrams.) “Nicotine has short-term negative health effects, like increasing your heart rate and blood pressure, so it can aggravate heart conditions,” says Marvin M. Lipman, Consumer Reports’ chief medical adviser. “It also interferes with fetal development, making it unsafe in pregnancy regardless of its source.” Larger doses of nicotine can be more harmful, especially to children, who may be attracted by the sweet flavors and brightly colored packages. And in 2014, poison-control centers responded to 3,783 e-cigarette and liquid nicotine exposure cases. More than half of those involved children younger than 6 who might have ingested or inhaled liquid nicotine or gotten it on their skin or in their eyes. In 2015, those centers received 3,067 nicotine-exposure reports across all age groups. Chemical concerns When propylene glycol is heated, it can degrade into formaldehyde, a chemical linked to nose and eye irritation, and an increased risk of asthma and cancer. The Center for Environmental Health recently tested 97 e-cig products and found formaldehyde and the chemical acetaldehyde in more than half of them. E-cig vapor can also contain lead, cadmium, nickel, tin and other metals, which can cause nervous-system or respiratory problems. And some flavoring chemicals, such as those used to create cinnamon flavor, can be toxic. But unlike conventional cigarettes, e-cigs don’t burn tobacco. So they don’t produce the tar that clogs the lungs, or carbon monoxide, which is linked to heart disease. Overall, experts say more research is needed. But given what we know now, vaping is less harmful than smoking tobacco. “If a patient switches from smoking two packs a day to only using e-cigs, it’s not as good as quitting, but it’s undeniably better,” says Douglas Kamerow, a former assistant surgeon general and a professor of family medicine at Georgetown University. “But if a nonsmoker starts vaping and gets hooked on nicotine, especially if it leads to tobacco smoking, that’s a problem.” Can they help smokers quit? A recent clinical trial found no real difference between e-cigs and nicotine patches in helping people stop smoking: Neither were very effective. Another study found that teenagers who smoke and vape tend to smoke more conventional cigarettes than those who smoke but don’t use e-cigs.

As teen smoking rates have declined, teen use of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices have increased. This is a real concern, and it has prompted many states to ban e-cigarette sales to minors. Such regulation sounds like a good idea, but new research suggests it may backfire. A forthcoming paper in the Journal of Health Economics finds that bans on teen access to e-cigarettes may increase teen smoking rates. Here’s how the Yale School of Public Health describes the research: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the research finds that state bans on e-cigarette sales to minors yield a 0.9 percentage point increase in rates of recent conventional cigarette use by 12 to 17 year olds, relative to states without these bans. “Conventional cigarette use has been falling somewhat steadily among this age group since the start of the 21st century. This paper shows that bans on e-cigarette sales to minors appear to have slowed this decline by about 70 percent in the states that implemented them,” said Abigail Friedman, assistant professor of public health and the study’s author. “In other words, as a result of these bans, more teenagers are using conventional cigarettes than otherwise would have done so.” Teen smoking is a serious public health concern, so these results should be alarming. As a father, I don’t want my kids to use e-cigarettes — and I certainly don’t want them to even consider doing so until they are mature enough to make informed choices — but I don’t want them to smoke even more. Nicotine addiction is bad, but nicotine addiction combined with the serious health consequences of smoking are worse. If forced to choose — and I would prefer not to — smoking is clearly the greater evil. There is increasing reason to believe that, whatever the risks of e-cigarette use, they are a tiny fraction of those presented by conventional cigarettes. There is also good evidence that using e-cigarettes as an alternative source of nicotine can help smokers quit (at least those smokers who want to quit), and they may be as — if not more — effective than alternative smoking cessation methods (at least for some smokers). Again, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free — and there is still much to be learned about their potential long-term health effects — there is an emerging consensus that they are far less dangerous than smoking. Insofar as there is a trade-off between smoking rates and vaping rates, the preference for vaping should be a no-brainer. That e-cigarettes are a potential substitute for traditional cigarettes is well understood by the tobacco industry — and it has that industry worried. While the big tobacco companies have developed their own e-cigarette brands, they are also supporting the increased regulation of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices. Such regulation is likely to suppress competition to the tobacco companies’ benefit, both by restricting the relative availability of e-cigarettes and reducing competition within e-cigarette markets to the advantage of larger firms. I explore this point with Bruce Yandle, Roger Meiners and Andrew Morriss in this Regulation article and this more extensive paper forthcoming in the Yale Journal on Regulation. The bottom line: Not only could poorly conceived e-cigarette regulation undermine public health, it could help tobacco companies as well. What does this all mean? Well-intentioned public health measures do not always protect public health. Premature or poorly constructed regulation of e-cigarettes may compromise smoking-reduction efforts and (as our research suggests) advance the interests of tobacco companies. I support measures to discourage teen e-cigarette use, and we should all want such measures to be effective. Regulation of new technologies is sometimes justified, but it can also do more harm than good. DISCLOSURE: In 2014, I co-authored a white paper on the political economy of e-cigarette regulation for which my co-authors and I received compensation from NJOY, an e-cigarette manufacturer. NJOY exercised no control over the conclusions of that white paper, and I have not maintained any relationship, economic or otherwise, with NJOY since completing that work. All of my conclusions about e-cigarette regulation are my own.	256	"[{""start"": 195, ""end"": 412, ""text"": ""Such regulation sounds like a good idea, but new research suggests it may backfire.

The number of middle and high school students using electronic cigarettes tripled from 2013 to 2014, according to government figures released Thursday, a startling increase that public health officials fear could reverse decades of efforts combating the scourge of smoking. The popularity of e-cigarettes among teenagers now eclipses that of traditional cigarettes, the use of which has fallen to the lowest level in years. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the spike in ­e-cigarette use “shocking.” “It’s a really bad thing, and it is subjecting another generation of our children to an addictive substance,” he said in an interview, adding that any type of nicotine exposure can harm the teenage brain and that some e-cigarette smokers undoubtedly will go on to use traditional cigarettes. Not everyone sees such cause for alarm in the new numbers. “The CDC should really be jumping for joy at the fact that smoking rates are declining. This is a huge success,” said Michael Siegel, a professor and tobacco-control specialist at Boston University’s School of Public Health. “Instead, they are using this as another opportunity to demonize e-cigarettes.” Siegel said he agrees that minors shouldn’t have access to any tobacco product. But he said the CDC numbers suggest that rather than serving as a gateway to cigarette smoking, e-cigarettes actually might be diverting teens from traditional cigarettes, which still account for nearly half a million tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. Thursday’s findings came as little surprise to many educators around the country, who have increasingly wrestled with how to handle the swift rise in e-cigarette use among students. Patricia Sheffer, superintendent of the Union County school system in Kentucky, grew so frustrated this year over the dozens of incidents of students being caught with e-cigarettes that last month she sent a recorded message to district parents and posted a plea on Facebook asking for help cracking down on the problem. The dogs that perform a sweep of the schools about once a month also are being trained to sniff out ­e-cigarettes, she said. “It’s just growing at such a rapid pace,” said Sheffer, who worries about the various substances students might be smoking in the devices. “I thought, ‘We have to take a stand.’ ” School districts around the country, such as in North Carolina’s Haywood County, are classifying e-cigarettes as drug paraphernalia, rather than as normal cigarettes, in hope that the more severe penalties will discourage students from bringing the devices to campus. “It was to send a message that we don’t want it,” said Associate Superintendent Bill Nolte. Anti-smoking advocates insist the rise in the popularity of ­e-cigarettes stems in part from aggressive marketing campaigns that Frieden called “straight out of the playbook” of ads that targeted young people in earlier generations. E-cigarettes remain unregulated by the federal government, ­although numerous cities and states have passed laws restricting sales to minors and banning the devices in public places. But e-cigarettes do not face the same federal restrictions on television and radio advertising that apply to traditional cigarettes. “These are the same images, the same themes and the same role models that the cigarette industry used 50 years ago,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “It’s the Marlboro Man reborn. It’s the Virginia Slims woman re-created, with the exact same effect. . . . This is not an accident.” Cynthia Cabrera, executive director of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, an industry group, said her organization supports banning sales to minors and disputed that e-cigarette companies are deliberately marketing to teens. She said that while tobacco giants with huge advertising budgets such as Lorillard and Altria have purchased e-cigarette companies in recent years, most e-cig marketing is still done by hundreds of small companies whose target audience is smokers looking for less-toxic options. “If you’re thinking this is Big Tobacco redux, that’s the wrong thinking,” she said. At the heart of the public health debate lies a series of unanswered questions: Are ­e-cigarettes unequivocally less harmful than tar-laden, chemical-filled tobacco cigarettes, as many people assume? Will they prove to be a healthier alternative that helps people avoid cigarette smoking and reduce tobacco-related deaths, or simply devices that could undermine decades of public health efforts? Siegel, the Boston University professor, said it “shouldn’t take a rocket scientist” to figure out that “vaping” is safer than smoking, given that the liquids used in e-cigarettes involve no combustion and very few chemicals. Likewise, Cabrera said regulators shouldn’t “lose perspective about the potential” for e-cigarettes to eliminate harm caused by smoking cigarettes. But plenty of uncertainty remains. A study published this week in the journal Tobacco Control, for instance, found that the chemicals used to flavor e-cigarettes could prove unsafe when inhaled over time. Public health officials say far more research is needed given how little data exists on the long-term effects of e-cigarettes. This much seems certain from Thursday’s results, based on an annual survey of 22,000 students around the country: Teens are experimenting as much as ever. Roughly a quarter of high school students and nearly 8 percent of middle school students still report having used a tobacco product at least once in the past 30 days. But from 2013 to 2014, the findings say, e-cigarette use among high school students had increased from 4.5 percent to 13.4 percent. Usage also more than tripled among middle school students, from 1.1 percent to 3.9 percent. Only among black students was another tobacco product — cigars — more popular than ­e-cigarettes, the CDC said. During that same period, the use of hookahs — water pipes used to smoke specially made tobacco — roughly doubled for middle and high school students, equaling and eclipsing the use of regular cigarettes, respectively. Meanwhile, the use of conventional cigarettes sank to the lowest levels in years. According to the CDC, 9.2 percent of high school students reported smoking a cigarette over the past month, compared with 12.7 percent a year earlier. Middle school students’ cigarette use dropped to 2.5 percent from 2.9 percent. While some people might see that as good news, anti-tobacco advocates and public health officials remain wary. “The drop in cigarette use is historic, with enormous public-health significance,” Myers said. But, he quickly added, “the explosion of ­e-cigarette use among kids means these products are being taken up in record numbers with totally unknown long-term consequences that could potentially undermine all the progress we’ve made.” Last April, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to begin regulating e-cigarettes, now a multibillion-dollar industry in the United States. The agency said it wants to force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, place health warning labels on the products and disclose their ingredients. The FDA’s initial proposals stopped short of halting online e-cigarette sales, restricting television advertising, or banning candy and fruit flavorings — chocolate, cotton candy, passion fruit, piña colada and hundreds of others — that critics say appeal to young users. A year later, the FDA has yet to finalize any new regulations involving e-cigarettes, though its top tobacco official said in an interview Thursday that doing so remains “our highest priority.” “The numbers are astounding,” said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, calling the recent jump in youth e-cigarette use a “clarion call” to bring the products under federal oversight. “What this tells us is that with all the progress we’ve made in reducing youth cigarette smoking, that progress is in jeopardy.” Myers said Thursday’s figures make clear that such action is long overdue, and that it can’t come soon enough. “The failure of the FDA to move more quickly means we have an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed,” he said. “In the absence of strong governmental action, these numbers will only keep going up.”	255	"[{""start"": 7223, ""end"": 7493, ""text"": ""The FDA’s initial proposals stopped short of halting online e-cigarette sales, restricting television advertising, or banning candy and fruit flavorings — chocolate, cotton candy, passion fruit, piña colada and hundreds of others — that critics say appeal to young users"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 7495, ""end"": 7579, ""text"": ""A year later, the FDA has yet to finalize any new regulations involving e-cigarette"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3139, ""end"": 3456, ""text"": ""But e-cigarettes do not face the same federal restrictions on television and radio advertising that apply to traditional cigarettes. “These are the same images, the same themes and the same role models that the cigarette industry used 50 years ago,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	263	2023-03-27T16:31:22.121647Z	2023-03-27T16:31:22.121772Z	1772.57
"More than 16 million children age 17 and under live in the District of Columbia and 10 states that allow them to buy e-cigarettes legally, according to a report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 10 states are Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas. The 40 other states have laws banning the sale of e-cigarettes and other devices, such as electronic cigars, to minors. Public health officials have warned about the dangers of e-cigarettes for youths. CDC officials have said that calls to poison centers involving e-cigarettes have surged in recent years. Last year, the CDC reported a dramatic increase in the number of high school students who said they had tried e-cigarettes, including some who had never smoked. The latest data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey showed 4.5 percent of all high school students and 1.1 percent of all middle school students had used e-cigarettes within the past 30 days in 2013. ""We know e-cigarettes are not safe for youth,"" said Tim McAfee, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. The CDC data is based on information obtained from its tobacco tracking system as of Nov. 30, 2014. The Food and Drug Administration announced in April that it intended for the first time to regulate the booming market of electronic cigarettes, as well as an array of other products such as cigars, pipe tobacco and hookahs. The move would begin to place restrictions on e-cigarettes, a nearly $2 billion industry that for years has operated outside the reach of federal regulators. If adopted, the government’s plan would force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, stop handing out free samples, place health warning labels on their products and disclose the ingredients. Makers of e-cigarettes also would be banned from making health-related claims without scientific evidence. The FDA’s proposal stops short of broader restrictions sought by many ­tobacco-control advocates. Regulators at this point are not seeking to halt online sales of e-cigarettes, curb television advertising, or ban the use of flavorings such as watermelon, grape soda and piña colada — all tactics that critics say are aimed at attracting young smokers and that have been banned for traditional cigarettes. The FDA proposed rule must undergo several steps before becoming final. The CDC report Thursday noted that the regulation does not address the use of e-cigarettes in public places. The report also said federal law allows states and localities to adopt or enforce more stringent requirements. E-cigarettes vary from brand to brand, but they generally resemble the size and shape of traditional cigarettes. Instead of burning tobacco, the battery-powered devices heat up flavored, nicotine-laced liquid, turning it into a vapor that the user inhales, or “vapes.” Supporters say that makes e-cigarettes an attractive alternative to their ­cancer-causing tobacco counterparts."	254	"[{""start"": 2022, ""end"": 2328, ""text"": ""Regulators at this point are not seeking to halt online sales of e-cigarettes, curb television advertising, or ban the use of flavorings such as watermelon, grape soda and piña colada — all tactics that critics say are aimed at attracting young smokers and that have been banned for traditional cigarettes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	262	2023-03-27T16:01:33.585383Z	2023-03-27T16:01:33.585456Z	494.593
Teenagers' use of e-cigarettes fell sharply last year, while overall tobacco use declined to a new low, according to data that some antismoking advocates said could signal a turning point in the decades-long effort against youth smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's annual report on youth and tobacco found that 11.3 percent of high school students used e-cigarettes in 2016, compared with 16 percent the year before. That's the first drop since the CDC started keeping track of e-cigarettes in 2011. In addition, just 8 percent of high-schoolers smoked cigarettes last year, while a little over 20 percent reported using “any tobacco product,” which includes cigars, hookahs, pipes, smokeless tobacco and small, leaf-wrapped cigarettes called bidis, as well as regular and e-cigarettes. Both those numbers are the lowest on record, the agency said. “This is unimaginable, extraordinary progress,” said Matthew Myers, president of the nonprofit Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, noting that almost 30 percent of young people smoked cigarettes in 2000. “This is a change of a cosmic nature that has the potential to dramatically impact lung cancer, heart disease, asthma and other problems.” At the same time, he and other anti-tobacco advocates warned that the number of young people using tobacco products — 3.9 million high school and middle school students — was still much too high. They warn that progress could be derailed, especially if the Trump administration weakens the regulation of e-cigarettes and certain other tobacco products. It has already delayed enforcement of some tobacco regulations. Robin Koval, president and chief executive of Truth Initiative, a nonprofit that focuses on tobacco use by young people, said the report suggests that the United States could be “well on our way to finishing smoking for good.” But she cautioned that the picture was very uneven among subgroups, with the high school smoking rate in West Virginia more than double the rate in California, for example. She also said that the rapid decline in e-cigarettes among high schoolers suggests much of that use “has been experimental and that the current offering of products may be less appealing” than had once been feared. But she added that the rapid innovation in the e-cigarette industry “underscores the urgency for full implementation of FDA regulation” of the products. The Food and Drug Administration asserted its authority to regulate e-cigarettes and some other products in 2016. But in early May, it delayed for three months the enforcement of some regulations that were to be imposed for the first time on e-cigarettes and cigars. The delay came as the vaping and tobacco industries have launched a concerted effort to roll back the FDA regulations through both legislation and litigation. The e-cigarette industry, which includes small vaping businesses as well as the large tobacco companies, has said that the rules are onerous and will drive them out of business. They say that e-cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes and should not be targeted. (Some aspects of the rules, including a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes and cigars to minors, went into effect last year.) The three-month delay was announced a week before Scott Gottlieb was confirmed as FDA commissioner. In a statement Thursday about the new CDC data, Gottlieb said that while the latest numbers “are encouraging, it is critical that we work to ensure this downward trend continues over the long term across all tobacco products.” He said the agency has issued more than 4,000 warning letters to brick-and-mortar and online retailers for selling newly-regulated tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes and cigars, to minors. Myers, of Tobacco-Free Kids, said that the report's good news “is balanced by the fact that the very regulatory structure and programs that have helped bring it about are now being threatened.” Referring to Gottlieb, he added, “he comes in at a critical time. If he delays or weakens the rules over e-cigarettes he threatens the progress we are making with kids. If however, he vigorously implements them even while exploring whether e-cigarettes can help adults quit, he has the potential to turn the current trend into an irreversible movement.” To determine how many young people are using tobacco products, the CDC asks them whether they have used it in the past 30 days. Brian King, the senior author of the CDC report, said the decrease in e-cigarette use is likely a result of several factors, including efforts by the government and public health groups to educate young people about possible hazards of the products. While they don't contain some of the harmful substances in conventional cigarettes, he said, the inhaled vapor usually contains nicotine, which is highly addictive and can harm the adolescent brain, as well as ultrafine particulates and heavy metals. King also said that declines in tobacco use also are partly due to increases in state and local tobacco taxes, as well as the inclusion of e-cigarettes in antismoking ordinances barring smoking in restaurants, bars and other sites. The federal government and some nonprofits have also mounted campaigns warning about the dangers of smoking. For example, the FDA's “Real Cost” campaign, Gottlieb said in his statement, has helped prevent nearly 350,000 kids from smoking since its launch in 2014, while the Truth Initiative has run “truth,” a campaign featuring hard-hitting messages on the tobacco industry and its marketing tactics. CDC's “Tips from Former Smokers,” aimed more at adults, also highlights the dangers of tobacco. Correction: This article originally misstated the name of an author of the CDC report.

The use of electronic cigarettes among middle and high school students has been rising rapidly, a trend that public health officials worry could undermine decades of efforts to reduce youth smoking and put a growing number of teenagers on a path toward conventional cigarettes. According to data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of middle and high school students in the United States who have used e-cigarettes more than doubled from 2011 to 2012. “The increased use of e-cigarettes by teens is deeply troubling,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in announcing findings from the National Youth Tobacco Survey. “Nicotine is a highly addictive drug. Many teens who start with e-cigarettes may be condemned to struggling with a lifelong addiction to nicotine and conventional cigarettes.” E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that look like cigarettes but do not burn tobacco. Rather, they deliver nicotine, flavor and other chemicals in the form of a vapor. A starter kit, which typically includes two e-cigarettes, extra batteries and various nicotine cartridges, can cost $20 to $200. Because of the limited research into e-cigarette use, their risks and benefits remain uncertain and subject to widespread debate. What’s more certain is their steady growth in popularity among adults and, according to the CDC survey, young people. The survey found that the percentage of high school students who said they had used an e-cigarette jumped from 4.7 percent in 2011 to 10 percent in 2012. Nearly 3 percent of those students said they had used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days, up from 1.5 percent a year earlier. Use also doubled among middle school students, the CDC reported. All told, more than 1.78 million middle and high school students nationwide had tried e-cigarettes in 2012, the agency said. Perhaps most troubling for public health advocates, the survey found that more than three-quarters of middle and high school students who had used e-cigarettes within the past month also had smoked conventional cigarettes during the same period. About 1 in 5 middle school students who reported using e-cigarettes said they had never tried conventional cigarettes. The CDC’s findings are in line with a more recent survey conducted in Florida that found that more than 4 percent of middle-schoolers and 12 percent of high-schoolers had tried e-cigarettes — figures that have risen dramatically over the past two years. Big U.S. tobacco companies have begun scooping up e-cigarette manufacturers with an eye toward a not-so-distant future, when, some analysts say, sales of e-cigarettes could eclipse those of conventional cigarettes. This year alone, tobacco giants such as Lorillard, Altria and Reynolds have begun wading into the e-cigarette market. E-cigarette use also has boomed in Europe in recent years. Anti-smoking activists say that the rise in the popularity has happened in part because the devices are largely unregulated and cultivate an image as a cooler, less harmful alternative to regular cigarettes. Although the Food and Drug Administration has long said it intends to expand its regulatory authority over tobacco products to include e-cigarettes, the agency has not done so. “FDA needs to act and act quickly to get a handle both on the product and its marketing,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. Without that kind of oversight, he said, e-cigarette companies have remained free to sell their products online and spend huge sums mimicking the advertising practices that big tobacco companies once used. “We have seen e-cigarettes marketed using exactly the same images in exactly the same places that the cigarette industry used decades ago,” he said. “Open a magazine, and you’ll see beautiful women and young celebrities marketing e-cigarettes. Go to NASCAR, and you’ll see cars sponsored by e-cigarettes.” Those efforts to “re-glamorize” smoking, Myers said, threaten to undo years of efforts and millions of dollars spent on campaigns to cut down on youth smoking in the United States and could create a new generation of smokers. Proponents of e-cigarettes reject comparisons to traditional cigarettes, arguing that they contain nowhere near the amount of harmful substances that smokers inhale. They also have argued that rather than creating a slippery slope that could lead nonsmokers toward other tobacco products, e-cigarettes have the potential to help people wean themselves off conventional cigarettes. Thomas Kiklas, president of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, said he doesn’t buy the argument that e-cigarettes are a “gateway” to traditional cigarettes for young people. “Kids have been smoking for hundreds of years,” he said. “So I don’t think any singular technology is going to push kids into cigarette use.” At the same time, he said, the association “absolutely” does not support sales or marketing aimed at minors and encourages its members to adhere to local, state and federal tobacco laws. He said the group supports mandatory online age verification on e-cigarette sales. The FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products still plans to assert its authority over e-cigarettes, its director said Thursday, in part because, without regulation, the agency has little way to know how safe or unsafe they are, how much nicotine or other chemicals users are inhaling, and whether the devices can help people quit smoking traditional cigarettes or lead them to try other tobacco products. “We don’t yet understand the long-term effects of these novel tobacco products,” Mitch Zeller, the FDA’s top tobacco official, said in a statement. “These findings reinforce why the FDA intends to expand its authority over all tobacco products and establish a comprehensive and appropriate regulatory framework to reduce disease and death from tobacco use.”	250	"[{""start"": 697, ""end"": 832, ""text"": ""Many teens who start with e-cigarettes may be condemned to struggling with a lifelong addiction to nicotine and conventional cigarettes"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 697, ""end"": 832, ""text"": ""Many teens who start with e-cigarettes may be condemned to struggling with a lifelong addiction to nicotine and conventional cigarette"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 3075, ""end"": 3251, ""text"": ""Although the Food and Drug Administration has long said it intends to expand its regulatory authority over tobacco products to include e-cigarettes, the agency has not done so."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3452, ""end"": 3616, ""text"": ""e-cigarette companies have remained free to sell their products online and spend huge sums mimicking the advertising practices that big tobacco companies once used."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	259	2023-03-27T15:38:39.856936Z	2023-03-27T15:38:39.857035Z	398.245
"The ads have popped up everywhere in recent years, from TV commercials featuring celebrities to model-adorned magazine spreads to banners splashed across websites. E-cigarette marketing has become so ubiquitous that it now reaches more than two-thirds of U.S. middle and high school students, according to a report Tuesday -- a development that some public health officials argue is prompting more teens to use the devices and threatening decades of progress in combating youth tobacco use. ""It’s the Wild West out there when it comes to e-cigarette advertising,"" said Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released the data. ""It's no coincidence that as the advertising has skyrocketed, the use of e-cigarettes has skyrocketed."" CDC's findings were drawn from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey, which included a representative sample of more than 22,000 middle and high school students. Nearly 70 percent -- an estimated 18.3 million students -- reported having seen e-cigarette marketing in at least one setting that year. They were most likely to see e-cig ads in retail stores, followed by the internet, television, movies, newspapers and magazines. Young people reported seeing more ads for conventional cigarettes and other tobacco products in retails stores than for e-cigarettes, but the level of exposure in other venues was comparable. ['Right now, for something like e-cigarettes, there are far more questions than answers'] Anti-smoking advocates and public health officials say advertising for conventional tobacco products such as cigarettes triggers increased experimentation among young people, leading to more smokers. They worry the same scenario is playing out with e-cigarettes, which currently don't face the advertising restrictions that apply to traditional cigarettes. That's bad news, they say, because of evidence that nicotine use can negatively affect the developing brains of teenagers, because so much remains unknown about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes and because of the potential that young people who try them could wind up as regular smokers. ""This is a problem,"" Frieden said. ""Whatever you think about adult use of e-cigarettes, kids should not be using e-cigarettes."" Tuesday's report comes as the e-cigarette industry continues to flourish in the United States. Sales have grown exponentially, hitting an estimated $2.5 billion in 2015. Researchers say e-cigarette advertising has grown along with the market, from an estimated $6.4 million in 2011 to an estimated $115 million in 2014. While manufacturers insist their products are aimed at solely at adults -- in many cases, smokers looking for a way to satisfy their nicotine cravings while avoiding the well-documented harm of tobacco -- the devices have become increasingly popular among young people. CDC reported last year that the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes tripled from 2013 to 2014, eclipsing their use of traditional cigarettes. [E-cigarette use triples among middle and high school students] In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to begin regulating e-cigarettes for the first time. The agency said it planned to force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, stop handing out free samples, place health warning labels on their products and disclose the ingredients. Makers of e-cigarettes also would be banned from making health-related claims without scientific evidence. However, the proposal stopped short of seeking restrictions on online sales of e-cigarettes or television advertising. And 18 months later, the FDA still has not finalized any of those new regulations. Cynthia Cabrera, executive director of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, an industry group, said that just because young people encounter e-cigarette ads doesn't mean the products are targeted toward minors. ""If you showed me [e-cigarette] ads on Nickelodeon or the Cartoon Network, at the Lego store or in Toys 'R' Us, then I'd say you have a legitimate gripe,"" Cabrera said. Those ads generally appear on channels such as Comedy Central, which primarily target adults but attract young viewers as well. ""They are putting their advertising in places where the demographic meets that of the adult vaper."" Cabrera cited a series of high-profile ads for Blu e-cigarettes that featured model and actress Jenny McCarthy, who is 43. ""Why would anyone use a 40-something-year-old woman to try to hook 17-year-old boys?"" she said. ""They chose someone well into their 40s to do the ad, because that's their demographic."" She also noted that most states already have age restrictions to keep e-cigarettes out of the hands of minors. Health officials should be highlighting the sharp drop in traditional cigarette smoking among young people, she said, and not demonize e-cigarettes, which are widely believed to be less harmful when used in the place of other tobacco products. But Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the latest data should give the Obama administration renewed urgency to begin overseeing the booming e-cigarette industry. In particular, Myers cited the report finding that more than half of all sixth-graders have seen e-cigarette ads in a retail store and more than a third have seen such ads on the internet. Companies ""are getting to them early, long before they become teenagers,"" he said. ""It was the case with cigarettes 25 years ago. They are using the same themes and the same images [as tobacco]. But the penetration in the modern media era is as strong as anything we’ve ever seen.""

Do e-cigarettes help smokers kick their bad habits, or do they end up promoting tobacco use among young people? It’s one of the most intensely debated questions in drug abuse research, but the current answer is unsatisfying: We need more evidence to clearly say who’s right. E-cigarettes — the electronic devices that allow people to “smoke” nicotine-laced vapor instead of combustible, tobacco-based products — have been the subject of polarized science ever since they gained popularity in 2006. For proponents of the technology (also known as “vaping”), e-cigarettes represent a free-market solution to tobacco addiction, offering smokers an effective way to consume nicotine while giving up the nasty chemicals in tobacco products. This is not a fringe movement: In Britain, e-cigarettes are actively promoted by doctors as a substitute for smoking traditional cigarettes. For critics, though, e-cigarettes are just a stepping stone to tobacco use. After achieving substantial headway in the reduction of smoking over the past few decades, many health advocates fear that the recent surge in vaping endangers the progress we’ve made, particularly among young people. The debate reignited last week after the academic journal Tobacco Control published a study claiming that e-cigarettes serve as a “one-way bridge” among young people to smoking combustible cigarettes . The study, which comes out of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, reviews survey data from 347 high school students throughout the United States on their use of cigarettes in 2014 and again as a follow-up in 2015. The study found that those who had vaped in 2014 were more than four times as likely to have reported smoking tobacco products in the following year. E-cigarette proponents quickly picked apart the study. Michael Siegel of Boston University, a tobacco control researcher, argued in a series of blog posts that the sample size was too small, noting that the conclusion rests on the smoking habits of just four students in the survey. Linda Bauld of the University of Stirling, who also studies tobacco control policies, reiterated an argument commonly featured in the e-cigarette debate: Even though vaping surged among young people over the past decade, tobacco usage rates continue to decline. Richard Miech, author of the study and a professor at the University of Michigan, defended his work in a phone interview, arguing that the conclusion is based on statistically significant data that is nationally representative. He also noted that his study backs up a handful of other studies examining the same question. “I feel like the science behind my study is sturdy,” Miech said, also noting that e-cigarette proponents have consistently challenged studies that come to the same conclusion. “Critics are going to keep denying [these studies] even as each new one comes out.” Still, Miech readily concedes that research on the topic is still relatively young and that more data needs to be collected. It took decades of rigorous academic research before the scientific community generated consensus that tobacco use was a public-health crisis. Should we really expect to have clear answers on the effects of vaping within a 10-year period of the product surging onto the market? Still, the National Institute on Drug Abuse already proclaims on its website that young people who vape are more likely to try tobacco products. Meanwhile, defenders of e-cigarettes religiously believe that the product helps addicts quit smoking, even though the most recent and thorough meta-analysis on the topic was inconclusive as to whether that was the case. What is well-established, however, is that vaping isn’t a healthy habit. Health experts warn that nicotine ingested while vaping can hurt arteries and increase the risk of heart disease. Some brands also contain formaldehyde, which increases the risk of cancer, and a few flavorings added to e-cig vapor contain diacetyl, which has long been associated with a lung disease called “popcorn lung.” Just last week, researchers at Johns Hopkins also found high levels of toxic metals in e-cigarette vapor. “When you smoke chemicals, it’s almost like taking an IV with those chemicals and putting them straight into your bloodstream,” Miech said. As a substitute to the long list of harmful chemicals found in combustible cigarettes, these harmful substances might be a desirable trade-off. But even the most ardent supporters of e-cigarettes should admit that the surge in teen vaping is probably not a good thing, whether or not it leads to increased tobacco use.

"The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it wants to reduce the nicotine in cigarettes to make them less addictive. The unexpected announcement sent shares of tobacco companies plummeting and sparked praise among some public health advocates. If successful, the effort would be the first time the government has tried to get the Americans to quit cigarettes by reaching beyond warning labels or taxes to attacking the actual addictive substance inside. The FDA rolled out a second major announcement at the same time: It is delaying for several years a key regulation affecting cigars and e-cigarettes, including flavored vaping products that studies show are especially enticing to youth. Specifically, it postponed the requirement that such products be approved by the agency. FDA’s commissioner Scott Gottlieb said both actions are part of a comprehensive plan to eventually wean smokers off conventional cigarettes and steer them toward less harmful alternative forms of nicotine like vaping. “The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes — the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,” he said. Some health proponents, however, expressed caution, pointing out that the nicotine-reduction proposal could take years to enact and could be derailed by major hurdles, including the significant lobbying power of tobacco industry. “The only actual thing that is happening right away is the delay,” said Dave Dobbins, chief operating officer at the tobacco-control group Truth Initiative. Not only is FDA delaying the timetable for e-cigarettes, he noted, but also the one for cigars, cigarillos and hookah — currently sold in convenient stores in kid-friendly flavors like grape and tropical punch flavors. “There’s no excuse for not regulating those products as quickly as possible,” he said. The reason FDA is delaying new regulations on e-cigarettes, Gottlieb said, is because it needs time to set the proper foundation for supervising such products, which he believes give smokers the nicotine they crave without many of the dangerous chemicals in cigarette smoke. Some public health officials were enthusiastic. Josh Sharfstein, who was deputy FDA commissioner in the Obama administration and now is a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Gottlieb's announcement  was an ""exciting moment"" because the FDA was signaling that it wanted to link its policies on e-cigarettes to those on cigarettes. ""The big picture here is that cigarettes as we know them could be phased out and e-cigarettes could be a bridge for people to not use cigarettes,"" he said. The surprising plan to force tobacco companies to lower nicotine in their cigarettes could have serious ramifications for the industry, which has seen a steady drop in American smokers for decades. Smoking in the United States is now at an all-time low, with just 15 percent of adults still lighting up. And tobacco use among youth has fallen to similarly historic lows, sparking hope among public health officials that a smoke-free generation may finally be within reach. Even before Gottlieb’s announcement, the tobacco industry has been trying to find new ways of maintaining its hold on remaining smokers in the United States by getting into the vaping business or with new tobacco products that deliver nicotine without smoke. For years, the public health world has been deeply divided over whether vaping and other alternative nicotine products are good for public health. By tying the two issues — lowering nicotine in traditional cigarettes and regulating e-cigarettes — Gottlieb hoped to unite all sides who are opposed to conventional cigarettes while also allaying their fears on e-cigs. In an interview with The Washington Post, he said he told staff from the moment he took the job as FDA commissioner that he wanted to find a way to help smokers quit. In his first agencywide speech, he told staffers that nothing they could accomplish in the next few years would be as important as reducing the smoking rate in America — and the 480,000 deaths every year it causes. “I told them I wanted to do something to dramatically change that … I wanted to do something to bend the curve,” Gottlieb said. The idea of reducing nicotine in cigarettes has existed for at least two decades, but the FDA did not have the authority to do so until a 2009 law gave it regulatory power over tobacco. Since then the FDA has slowly been laying the groundwork to wield that new authority. Because it is such a drastic move, lowering the nicotine could have unintended consequences, a concern FDA officials acknowledged Friday and said they would be studying. It could create a black market for higher nicotine cigarettes. Depending on how the plan is implemented, it could cause smokers to smoke more deeply or in greater amounts to compensate, warned some researchers. Others in the past have expressed concerns that the withdrawal it could imbalance smokers with mental illnesses — who make up a huge proportion of the people still smoking in the United States. One of the most important decision for FDA will be whether it lowers nicotine gradually over several years or reduces it sharply to a much less addictive level, said Eric Donny, one of country’s foremost researchers on low-nicotine cigarettes. For the past six years at the University of Pittsburgh, Donny has run experiments — funded by the National Institutes of Health and the FDA — on low-nicotine cigarettes. His studies have found that lower-nicotine cigarettes could indeed wean smokers of the habit and prompt them to quit. But dropping the nicotine level immediately is key, he said, because gradually lowering nicotine could lead to problems like causing smokers to smoke more. “It's a sound idea and if done the right way could have a huge effect,” he said. In their Friday announcement, FDA officials said other rules affecting e-cigarettes, such as a ways to prevent sales to minors, will remain in place. And the delay won't affect future deadlines such as requirements that manufacturers provide FDA with lists of ingredients. The announcement comes on the heels of furious lobbying by the e-cigarette industry to roll back hefty FDA regulations, issued last year, that would have affected e-cigarette products that came on market after Feb. 15, 2007. Nearly all the e-cig products sold today would be required to go through rigorous review, industry officials said. Greg Conley, president of the pro-vaping American Vaping Association, said he was relieved by Gottlieb’s announcement, saying that without it, 99 percent of vaping products would have been banned. Under the 2009 Tobacco Control Act, the FDA is permitted to consider reducing nicotine in cigarettes but may not ban it. The FDA, officials said, also will look at the impact of flavoring in e-cigarettes and cigars, both on children who might find flavors appealing and adults who might find them a useful tool to stop smoking. They also indicated they would consider exempting premium cigars from FDA regulations. The product-approval requirement for e-cigarettes and cigars was part of the so-called “deeming rule,” in which the agency decided that e-cigarettes would be subject to the same rules as conventional cigarettes. The rule gave manufacturers about two years — until sometime in 2018 — to get FDA approval for their products or risk having them pulled off the market. Under the revised timelines applications for products such as cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco, would need to be submitted by Aug. 8, 2021 and applications for noncombustible products such as e-cigarettes would need to be submitted by Aug, 8, 2022. Manufacturers would be permitted to continue to sell their products during the FDA reviews."	244	"[{""start"": 522, ""end"": 693, ""text"": ""It is delaying for several years a key regulation affecting cigars and e-cigarettes, including flavored vaping products that studies show are especially enticing to youth."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1607, ""end"": 1825, ""text"": ""Not only is FDA delaying the timetable for e-cigarettes, he noted, but also the one for cigars, cigarillos and hookah — currently sold in convenient stores in kid-friendly flavors like grape and tropical punch flavors."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4861, ""end"": 4966, ""text"": ""it could cause smokers to smoke more deeply or in greater amounts to compensate, warned some researchers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4967, ""end"": 5160, ""text"": ""Others in the past have expressed concerns that the withdrawal it could imbalance smokers with mental illnesses — who make up a huge proportion of the people still smoking in the United States."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4756, ""end"": 4860, ""text"": ""t could create a black market for higher nicotine cigarettes.

Reggae music poured from the speakers Thursday afternoon inside the DC Vape Joint, a basement shop that opened last month in Adams Morgan. Display cases held dozens of electronic cigarettes and a seemingly endless array of nicotine liquids, in far-flung flavors such as Mojito and Moon Pie, Swedish Fish and Scooby Snacks. On a nearby couch, shop co-owner Erik Miller and store manager Ryan Bixby took drags off their own e-cigarettes, filling the tiny space with apple- and vanilla-scented vapors. They hardly sounded troubled by Thursday’s announcement that the Food and Drug Administration intends to start regulating the rapidly expanding e-cigarette market. “We’re excited,” said Bixby, 30. “With regulation comes standardization. The quality is going to improve.” If approved, the FDA’s proposal would quickly put curbs on sales to minors, require health warning labels and disclosure of ingredients, and prohibit manufacturers from making unverified health-related claims — ideas that most e-cigarette producers and retailers say they embrace. What comes after that might prove far more delicate and divisive. For now, the FDA isn’t seeking to halt online sales of e-cigarettes, forbid television advertising, or ban the dizzying array of flavorings, from mango to margarita to mocha, which tobacco control advocates say are aimed at luring young smokers and which have been banned in traditional cigarettes. Those rules eventually could come, FDA officials say, but only after there is a scientific basis for broader regulations. The FDA’s long-awaited move to begin regulating e-cigarettes — as well as cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah tobacco and other products — drew swift and mixed reactions Thursday from public health officials, consumer advocates and manufacturers. But almost everyone agreed that the details of how the agency eventually regulates the rapidly evolving, $2 billion-a-year e-cigarette industry will shape it dramatically and could have profound effects on public health. The public has 75 days to comment on the FDA’s proposal, and manufacturers will have two years after the current rules are finalized to submit applications to the FDA to approve their products, which can remain on the market in the meantime. Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called Thursday’s action an important step but said that it is “inexcusable” that the FDA had taken years to act. He said the agency must move quickly to conduct the research it will need to crack down on the flavorings and marketing aimed at minors. “They can’t move forward at the same pace that they have been moving and do their job protecting public health,” Myers said. “We can’t waste another five years; this cannot take that long. There is a moral and public health imperative for them to treat this with the urgency it deserves.” Some industry advocates worry that federal regulation will benefit only a handful of large e-cigarette companies that have the money and staffing needed to file the mountain of paperwork required to seek FDA approval for every e-cigarette product. “This is worse than I expected,” said Greg Conley, a board member of the American Vaping Association, who had hoped that the FDA would grandfather in existing products, rather than force e-cigarette makers to file lengthy applications for any product on the market dating to early 2007. “A lot of these companies, they are supporting several employees, investing any profits back into their business. . . . They can’t afford this, and it’s going to lead to a whole lot of consolidation and increased prices for consumers.” Not everyone agrees. Some of the largest players in the e-cigarette market praised the FDA for committing to a science-based decision-making process, which they hope will allow them to make a case that e-cigarettes have the potential to reduce tobacco-related harm. “What they did today was very encouraging,” said Miguel Martin, president of Logic Technology Development, one of the nation’s leading e-cigarette companies. “At least speaking for my company, this will not be the tobacco wars of the ’80s and ’90s.” The market for e-cigarettes — battery-powered devices that heat up a liquid and deliver nicotine-laced vapor to users — still pales in comparison to the $80 billion in annual tobacco sales, but that gap is narrowing, and some analysts think e-cigarettes could eclipse conventional cigarettes in popularity within a decade. The FDA’s move comes at a time when many questions remain about whether e-cigarettes actually help people kick the smoking habit or put more people on a path toward smoking. It comes as cities and states are putting in place public bans on e-cigarettes over the objections of advocates who say they should be embraced as a welcome replacement to toxic, burning tobacco. As the federal government enters the fray, it faces a balancing act of setting sensible restrictions that will ensure safe products while restricting access to minors, but won’t crush an industry that has the potential to reduce the number of tobacco smokers in America. In the end, the FDA insists, the data will dictate which direction regulators take. That’s fine by Jason Healy, founder and president of blu eCigs, which was acquired by Lorillard in 2012. “It will move from theory and conjecture and gut feelings to a science-based regulatory framework,” Healy said. “Both sides have to now be accountable for their statements. You’re going to have to put science behind it.” However that pans out, he said, it’s likely to be good for customers visiting the vape shop in Adams Morgan, and thousands of others like it around the country. “There’s been so much uncertainty,” Healy said. “Now, everyone will know where we stand.”	239	"[{""start"": 1778, ""end"": 1997, ""text"": ""But almost everyone agreed that the details of how the agency eventually regulates the rapidly evolving, $2 billion-a-year e-cigarette industry will shape it dramatically and could have profound effects on public healt"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3380, ""end"": 3493, ""text"": ""“A lot of these companies, they are supporting several employees, investing any profits back into their business."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3380, ""end"": 3493, ""text"": ""“A lot of these companies, they are supporting several employees, investing any profits back into their business."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 4455, ""end"": 4627, ""text"": ""The FDA’s move comes at a time when many questions remain about whether e-cigarettes actually help people kick the smoking habit or put more people on a path toward smoking"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4455, ""end"": 4628, ""text"": ""The FDA’s move comes at a time when many questions remain about whether e-cigarettes actually help people kick the smoking habit or put more people on a path toward smoking."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1778, ""end"": 1997, ""text"": ""But almost everyone agreed that the details of how the agency eventually regulates the rapidly evolving, $2 billion-a-year e-cigarette industry will shape it dramatically and could have profound effects on public health"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	248	2023-03-27T12:38:30.236162Z	2023-03-27T12:38:30.236263Z	1375.887
