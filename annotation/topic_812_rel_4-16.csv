When 13-year-old Hope Witsell was found hanging in her bedroom after a topless photo she sent to a boy went rocketing around her middle school and a nearby high school, the news shocked the world. At the time, in 2009, NBC News reported that young Hope was only the second known case of bullying due to sexting. A nationally known “cyberlawyer” declared to the Tampa Bay Times that sexting-related suicides were “tracking the same way cyberbullying-related suicides are.” Years later, society still appears to be grappling with what exactly sexting is (nude pictures? or lewd messages?) and why kids continue to do it. Study after study has found that sexting is common — especially among teens who are, in many cases, discovering their sexuality and navigating increasingly complex social relationships. The most recent addition to the growing body of research on the subject: a Drexel University study published in the journal Sexuality Research and Social Policy that looks closely at sexting behaviors among minors and whether knowing about potential consequences plays any role in their decisions to sext. In most states, teens risk harsh penalties otherwise reserved for sex offenders if they’re charged with sending lewd images to minors, although some states have recently tried to change that. The survey of 175 undergraduate students from a large northeastern university has some interesting findings about what kids are doing when they sext and why. Most respondents, who were between 18 and 22, weren’t aware of the potential legal consequences of sexting. But of ones who were, 58 percent had never sexted as minors. Of the students who were unaware of potential legal consequences, 61 percent reported sexting as a minor. Here are some of the more interesting findings: 1. More than half of the survey respondents said that they sexted as a minor. But that’s only part of the story. That finding should come as a surprise to no one. But interestingly, the study found that the reach of sexts is probably even greater than those numbers indicate. There’s a ricocheting effect: 29 percent of survey respondents say they shared a sext they received with someone else, including a good friend, acquaintance; and 11 percent said they knew their sext had been forwarded around to people other than the intended receiver, according to the study. 2. Of those, a smaller portion, about 28 percent said they sexted pictures. 3. Boys sexted more, but not by a wide margin. 4. When sexting happened, it wasn’t frequent.  “Though many respondents acknowledged participating in sexting as minors, the frequency with which they engaged in this behavior and the number of partners with whom they exchanged sexts were fairly small,” the study’s author’s wrote. 5. They claim to have sexted as minors in the context of exclusive intimate relationships. That’s a good thing.  Despite some of the more shocking horror stories about sexting, most respondents in the Drexel survey said that they sexted an exclusive partner, or someone they were romantically interested in. The authors suggest that this might actually help keep the frequency of sexting down, and it explains why the number of recipients of sexts averaged around 1.8 people. 6. They may be sexting, but they’re not feeling the consequences.  For the study’s authors, this finding was actually heartening. It suggests, they said, that most teens aren’t experiencing severe bullying, harassment or legal punishment as a result of exchanging sexts. “This also highlights the important distinction between what appears to be the more common practice of consensual sexting that occurs within the context of a romantic relationship, and the more extreme cases of sexting that involve exploitation, extortion, and harassment,” they wrote. 7. On the other hand, teens report hearing about other people who did experience negative consequence. 8. A divide on the consequences. While the responses seem to be nearly evenly split between those in favor of punishment, those opposed and those who only favor it in some circumstances, researchers found that former sexters were much more likely to oppose punishment for sexting than people who had never sexted as minors.	154	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 195, ""text"": ""13-year-old Hope Witsell was found hanging in her bedroom after a topless photo she sent to a boy went rocketing around her middle school and a nearby high school, the news shocked the world"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	164	2023-03-21T15:47:09.402718Z	2023-03-21T15:47:09.402857Z	288.526
“We’re all human” was one of Ryan Bartel’s favorite expressions. As a teen with Asperger syndrome, he had struggled socially for most of his life. But he began to blossom during his junior year at Woodgrove High School in Purcellville. He made friends, many of whom were enduring difficulties of their own, and even provided comfort to some teens who were having thoughts of suicide. “He told us that he had saved several of his friends,” Ryan’s mother, Suzie Bartel, said. “And, of course, the sad part is that he didn’t tell anyone else what he was going through.” Ryan took his life in October 2014, during his senior year at Woodgrove. He was 17. In January of this year, western Loudoun County was devastated by the suicide of William Robinson, a 17-year-old Loudoun Valley High School student. The two deaths left many in the community wondering what they could do to help other teens who were battling feelings of hopelessness and despair. On Wednesday, Woodgrove students and staff members will take part in a 1.5-mile “We’re All Human” walk to raise awareness of teen suicide. The walk will be co-sponsored by the Ryan Bartel Foundation, which was created by Ryan’s parents to help prevent such deaths. Organizers say they hope the walk will encourage students who are considering taking their lives to reach out for help. “The students are craving it,” said Geri Fiore, Woodgrove’s director of school counseling. “They don’t want to lose anyone else. This really hit the community hard.” The idea for the walk came from a group of students Fiore gathered in the fall to discuss the problem of teen suicide. Suzie Bartel joined them and suggested sponsoring an art project to raise awareness about the issue. “What happened in that meeting was really quite extraordinary, because as I was telling them about ideas for artwork, I also told them that we need more ideas,” Bartel said. “All of a sudden there was this brainstorming going on in that room, and the energy was incredible.” “It was like magic,” Fiore said. That initial group of students has grown into the school’s We’re All Human Committee, which has about 35 members, Fiore said. They are making signs displaying facts and statistics about suicide to post along the school’s cross-country course, where the walk will take place. Senior Minh-Tam Tran Le, a member of the committee, said the group decided that a walk would be the best way to engage the entire school. “So we can do that . . . by actually getting people up and moving and interacting with their friends, all on a course that is designed to have you be aware of suicide facts and suicide stories,” Tran Le said. “It allows people to immerse themselves in the message of awareness . . . that this is an issue that affects everyone.” At the end of the walk, participants will go to the gym for an all-school assembly, where a student rock band will perform, and speakers will talk about suicide prevention. The assembly will also feature the premiere of a documentary directed by two students, Sidney Ramirez and Kirsten Hein, in which students tell about their experiences with feelings of hopelessness. “I just saw preview of the documentary, and I cried a little bit because these kids are struggling every day,” junior Puneet Kaur said. Senior Diana Tinta said people tend to avoid talking about suicide because the issue is too sensitive. “But I feel [that] talking about it is the solution to it,” she said. “So many [suicide victims] have friends that just don’t know that they’re struggling, because in the past we didn’t put an emphasis on being able to talk about how they’re feeling.” Members of the committee said they hope the walk becomes an annual event and spreads to other schools in the county. The group also hopes to create a “safe space” at the school where students who are struggling with depression can talk about their feelings, Tran Le said. “It’s establishing a way to address the problem instead of just awareness that there is a problem,” she said. “If it will just save one life, I think we’ve done our job,” Puneet said. The “We’re All Human” Walk will begin Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. at Woodgrove High School. The public is invited to participate.	153	"[{""start"": 567, ""end"": 799, ""text"": ""Ryan took his life in October 2014, during his senior year at Woodgrove. He was 17.

On a sunlit day in June, Cara Lynn Golias joined a group of friends at their secret swimming hole in Hemlock Overlook Regional Park, splashing into the water from a rope swing tied to a railroad trestle. Cara and her friends, who called themselves the “Naughty Nine,” relaxed beneath the bridge over Virginia’s Bull Run, smiling for a group photo with their toes in the silty shallows. It was “perfect,” she later tweeted, and by all accounts a carefree afternoon for a 16-year-old with a bright future. Cara, a star cross-country runner, had earned the grand prize at a regional science fair for her microbiology research on E. coli, and she made all A’s as a Fairfax High School junior, her father said. But on Sept. 28, for reasons still unknown to her family, Cara returned to the place she treasured most, slipping into the woods near Manassas Park and hanging herself from the railroad bridge. “It took everybody by surprise,” said her father, Michael Golias. “That’s why we’re still trying to figure out what happened.” Cara was one of three teenage girls from Fairfax County who died in apparent suicides since September, including a 17-year-old South Lakes High senior and a 15-year-old Robinson Secondary sophomore, schools officials said. It’s an alarming number of female teen suicides for a county that had 13 suicides among girls between the ages of 10 to 19 from 2003 to 2013, according to Virginia Health Department figures, an average of just more than one a year. The three deaths come as the school system has begun to overhaul its teen mental-health policies since six suicides in three years at W.T. Woodson High School and two suicides within 24 hours last fall at Langley High School. Experts with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Fairfax County Health Department are now investigating potential suicide clusters in the county at the request of state health officials. This week, CDC experts have led focus-group meetings with parents at eight high schools, including Fairfax, Langley, Robinson, South Lakes and Woodson, to identify risk factors and suicide-prevention strategies, according to a schools document. Glen Barbour, a spokesman for Fairfax’s Health Department, said that the CDC experts will “help investigate the risk factors that may be contributing to youth suicides in Fairfax County and to make recommendations on what additional prevention steps could be taken.” Kim Dockery, the county’s chief academic officer, said the school system has received multiple grants to focus on students’ mental health, including $50,000 in federal aid targeted for Woodson High. Another grant from the state will allow the school system to spend $2.8 million over the next five years on expanding a mental-health first-aid program. To help identify teens in distress, Dockery said, all middle school and high school teachers are enrolled in mental-health awareness training this semester. A new county suicide help line that lets teens send text messages has proven life-saving, Dockery said. “Suicide is a very complex issue,” said Asha Ivey-Stephenson, a behavioral scientist with the CDC in Atlanta. “It’s something that is preventable, and it’s a public health problem.” Ivey-Stephenson said that although females are more likely to have suicidal thoughts, males are more likely to go through with suicide. She said the suicide rate among males tends to be four times that of females across all age groups. According to data from the Virginia Department of Health, suicide is one of the top causes of death for those between 10 and 24 years old. Marc Leslie, who oversees the state’s Violent Death Reporting System, said that between 2003 and 2013, males ages 10 to 19 had a suicide rate of 5.5 per 100,000. During that same span, females ages 10 to 19 had a suicide rate of 1.8. He said that each case is multifaceted, which makes investigating the root causes of suicides particularly frustrating for data scientists and families. “It’s often a mystery,” Leslie said. Golias said his daughter’s death shocked her family members and left them with questions that might never be answered. “It’s like, ‘Cara, why did you do this? You were loved. You had a great heart.’ This is the question we all have,” her father said. “Her future looked so bright. . . . She was intelligent. She had great friends. She was part of the church group. She had loving parents and a loving family. She was involved with team sports. She was well-liked. But nothing that we saw could have led to something like this.” Cara was a soccer player and long-distance runner; she ran the Marine Corps Marathon at age 14 in 2011, one of three times she completed the race with her father. Last month, Golias ran the marathon again, a race he had planned to take part in with his daughter. Instead, he pinned Cara’s bib on his back and ran in her memory. Approaching the finish, he turned and ran backward so that Cara crossed the line two seconds ahead of his official time. The Marines handed Golias a finisher’s medal for himself and a second to keep for Cara. “You wouldn’t want to wish this on any other parent, because kids are such a big part of your life,” Golias said. “I’m sad for the loss of memories I would have made with Cara . . . and also I’m sad that Cara will not be able to experience some of the pleasures of this life. Graduating high school. Graduating college. Her first job. Getting married. Having a honeymoon. Having a child of her own. Celebrating her child’s first birthday. . . . Those are the things I’m going to miss with Cara.” Golias, who is divorced from Cara’s mother, encouraged parents to do whatever it takes to help their children if they are in distress. He said his daughter had been taking part in mental-health therapy in the months before she died. He also encouraged families to talk to other teens, who might see signs that parents miss. A memorial fund in Cara’s honor raised $16,166 for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “Do what you need to do to ensure that this doesn’t happen to your child,” Golias said. “Seek out professional help. Shower your child with love and understanding. Be there for your child.” On Oct. 30, Cara’s birthday, her friends went back to their favorite swimming spot. They created a memorial in her honor and left flowers beside a makeshift cross they planted in the rocky banks in the bridge’s shadow.

Two students at George Mason University have become the latest victims of “sextortion,” in which people send sexually explicit photos or videos of themselves to someone over the Internet and are then extorted for money by the recipient in exchange for not distributing them further, the university police said Monday in an alert distributed to GMU students and staff.   Just last month, the Justice Department declared in a new report that “sextortion is by far the most significantly growing threat to children, with more than 60 percent of survey respondents indicating this type of online enticement of minors was increasing.” The department performed a “National Child Exploitation Threat Assessment” by surveying investigators, prosecutors, analysts and victim service providers to determine the biggest threats in child sexual exploitation. At Mason, police said that unidentified suspects had gained the trust of two students over the Web in the past week, then enticed them to broadcast sex acts through their webcams. “The suspects then recorded the footage of the victims,” Capt. Brian R. Cozby wrote in the email, “and threatened to circulate the videos on the Internet unless the victims paid $5,000.” GMU officials declined to release any other information about the case, including whether the university police were enlisting any other law enforcement help to find the suspects or what was being done for the victimized students. University spokesman Michael Sandler said the investigation was continuing. In releasing a new “National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction” in April, the Justice Department made clear that sextortion has numerous tragic consequences. “The threat of sextortion directed toward children is not just restricted to the immediate sexual and emotional abuse imposed by the offender on their victims,” the report found. “Sextortion victims engage in cutting, have depression, drop out of school or grades decline, as well as engage in other forms of self-harm at an alarming rate. In fact, a 2015 FBI analysis of 43 sextortion cases involving child victims revealed at least two victims committed suicide and at least ten more attempted suicide. Thus, at least 28 percent of these cases had at least one sextortion victim who committed or attempted suicide.” A 13-year-old girl named Amanda Todd is among the best-known victims of sextortion. In 2010, the Canadian girl showed her breasts during a video chat on the web. The recipient then messaged her on Facebook and demanded more, or else. When Todd refused to cooperate, the recipient shipped a photo to Todd’s Facebook friends. In 2012, she posted a moving video about her predicament. Soon after, she committed suicide. Here is her video: Investigators say that sextortion is often committed by organized groups, rather than individuals, who not only recruit “agents” to extract explicit material from victims, but then pay monthly incentives “for the best-performing blackmailer,” Cozby wrote. The Justice Department wrote that “it is becoming common for investigations to reveal that a single sextortion offender has been communicating with hundreds of potential victims. Forensic examinations of sextortion offenders’ digital media commonly reveal thousands of organized folders containing videos and documentation of their contact with countless minors, often around the world.” In one 2015 FBI sextortion investigation, the Justice Department wrote, “offenders were specifically seeking out those children they considered easy targets because of their demonstrated willingness to post personal content online and engage in live-streaming video activity, whether the content was sexually explicit or not.” President Obama declared April “National Child Abuse Prevention Month.” In 2014, USA Today reported that the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force had recorded an increase in sextortion complaints from 5,300 in 2010 to 7,000 in 2013, a 32 percent rise in three years. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) reported that it received more than 800 sextortion-related tips between 2013 and 2015, that 78 percent of those victimized were female, and that the offender in three-fourths of the cases was seeking more explicit material, rather than money or sex. Interpol is also tracking sextortion. Their website noted that “the blackmailer might assume the identity of an attractive man or woman then, after gaining the victim’s trust, will record footage of the victim in the nude or performing a sexual act,” and threaten to circulate the footage to friends or post it online unless money is paid. But in another version, “the engagement between the victim and the criminal is interrupted by a child appearing on the screen during the sex act. The victim then receives a demand, often appearing to come from a police agency, stating that an investigation will be launched unless the victim pays.” The Justice Department said it was collaborating with NCMEC to distribute materials to law enforcement and social services presenters across the country, to increase awareness of sextortion. The department also said it would develop training for prosecutors on investigation and prosecution of sextortion cases.	151	"[{""start"": 2045, ""end"": 2209, ""text"": ""In fact, a 2015 FBI analysis of 43 sextortion cases involving child victims revealed at least two victims committed suicide and at least ten more attempted suicide."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2210, ""end"": 2322, ""text"": ""Thus, at least 28 percent of these cases had at least one sextortion victim who committed or attempted suicide."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2323, ""end"": 2738, ""text"": ""A 13-year-old girl named Amanda Todd is among the best-known victims of sextortion.

It is the hair that haunts her. More than a week after the accident, after seeing the tiny girl plummet from the highway overpass, after feeling the girl land on the roof of her car with a sickening thud and a shattering of glass, Chelci Frutos still cannot forget the girl’s hair. “I saw a long black ponytail as she was falling,” Frutos told The Washington Post. “Afterwards, I kept picturing her falling over and over and over again in my mind.” Frutos is far from the only person who will have trouble forgetting Izabel Laxamana’s hair. Her beautiful dark locks are at the center of Laxamana’s strange, sad and controversial story. Laxamana died on May 30, roughly 24 hours after throwing herself off an interstate overpass in Tacoma, Wash., and onto Frutos’s passing car. As tragic as the 13-year-old’s death is, it’s what happened shortly before the suicide that is causing outrage. Days before the teen’s death, Laxamana’s father cut off her hair on camera in an apparent attempt to shame his daughter for “getting messed up.” [Inside Tumblr’s teen suicide epidemic] Suicides, especially teen suicides, are a complex matter. Experts always caution that it’s usually too simple to blame a single event and that the majority of young people who take their own lives have a mental disorder, often “undiagnosed, untreated or both.” A message Laxamana posted online last August hinted at deeper troubles. “I feel hated most of the time im in school i feel looked down on and i get judged alot” [sic] she wrote. “In a school with so many people its weird to say ‘i feel alone’ but the truth is that you really do feel alone.” Still, a local blog directly blamed the shaming video for Laxamana’s suicide. And on a Facebook page called “Justice for Izabel,” commenters called for the father to be prosecuted or publicly shamed himself. The video is just the latest in a growing trend of “shaming” videos, in which angry parents around the country seek to discipline disobedient children by filming their humiliation. The videos are then uploaded to Web sites like YouTube or Facebook where the child’s friends can watch. Laxamana’s original “shaming” video has been removed from the Internet, but a bootleg recording of the video appears to show Laxamana in her family’s garage. Sporting a fresh, jagged haircut, she stares at the camera as a man, reportedly her father, Jeff, films her. [Leelah Alcorn’s death was tragic, but harassing her parents is not the answer] “The consequences of getting messed up, man, you lost all that beautiful hair,” he says. The camera then pans down to a tangle of black hair on the ground. “Was it worth it?” the man says. “No,” Laxamana replies faintly. “How many times did I warn you?” he asks. “A lot,” she says in a near whisper. It’s unclear when, exactly, the video was made, who uploaded it to the Internet, or what role it played in Laxamana’s suicide. Tacoma police could not be reached for comment on Sunday night but told the New York Daily News that the father was not the one who posted the video online. “She was a 13-year-old that made some poor choices, meaning that she didn’t have to kill herself,” Tacoma police public information officer Loretta Cool told the Daily News, adding that someone else leaked the video online in a tragically misguided attempt to help correct the teen’s behavior. “It was, ‘I’m going to record this, it’s yours, that way you’ll think twice before you do this again,’” Cool said of the father’s reason for making the shame video. “It was part of the discipline process,” she said. “So she would remember and not do it again.” On May 29, a few days after the video was made, Laxamana was reportedly riding in a car on South 48th Street in Tacoma when it passed over Interstate 5. She jumped out of the car and hurled herself over the edge of the bridge. [Teen suicide: Adults need to listen to kids, and it’s time to talk about the issue] Frutos, a married mother of two young children, was on her way to work as a waitress. “It was exactly at 3 p.m.,” she remembered. “I left home to go to work early that day because I have a problem with being late. So I was going to make sure that I was on time and it just so happened that I left a half an hour early.” Frutos was driving north along I-5 when she saw a small shape drop from the bridge. “I saw a person falling out of the sky,” she told The Washington Post. “I was back far enough to where I saw the whole entire fall. I didn’t actually see her jump, I just saw a person fling over the overpass. “Excuse my language, but I was like, ‘Is there a f—— person falling out of the sky?'” she said. “That’s exactly what I thought in my head.” “Once I saw her falling I completely froze,” Frutos said. “I was in shock. I didn’t think it was a real person. I mean, I knew it was. I think I did let off the gas but I didn’t brake. I just held onto the steering wheel and was in shock and watched this girl fall.” The entire incident happened in the blink of an eye as Laxamana fell roughly 30 feet from the overpass and Frutos sped toward her at 65 miles per hour, unable to react. “As I got closer I could tell that she was a young person,” Frutos said. “I saw her skin color. And I saw a ponytail.” For days afterward, the ponytail wouldn’t just haunt Frutos; it would also confuse her. She read about Laxamana’s father cutting off all her hair and wondered if she had been seeing things. “The story about her dad hacking off her hair I didn’t believe at first because I saw a long black pony tail as she was falling,” Frutos said. “I was literally that close. But I came to find out that it was just a piece of her hair that he left long. She did have a long piece of hair that was left and that’s what I saw. “As I was driving I wasn’t even watching the cars in front of me. I was just holding the steering wheel as tight as I possibly could because later that day my wrists were hurting,” she said. “As I lost sight of her I knew she was going to hit my car.” [16 percent of teens consider suicide before graduation. This quest is for them.] That’s exactly what happened. Laxamana’s tiny, teen body landed on top of Frutos’s 2001 Nissan Altima with so much force it shattered both the front and back windshields. “It was extremely loud,” Frutos said. “I knew what happened but I didn’t believe what happened, I guess. I didn’t know if I was hurt. It was extremely loud. The glass just shattered all inside of the car. “The roof caved in half an inch from my head,” she said. “I could have lost my life, too, if she had fallen onto me.” Frutos was stunned but had the presence of mind not to swerve or slam on the brakes. “After it happened I didn’t brake because I didn’t know if she was still on my car or if she had fallen off,” she said. “I just drifted to a stop and stayed in my lane. “I was freaking out,” she said. “I was hysterical and screaming at the top of my lungs. “I put my car in park and just sat there and screamed like bloody murder. I didn’t open the door. I didn’t move I just screamed inside. I reached over because somehow my phone flung to other side of the car. I called my husband and when he answered the phone all he heard was my screaming. I finally got out that somebody jumped off the bridge. He said, ‘Where are you?’ I couldn’t even tell him where I was because I was so shaken up, but eventually I said, ‘I’m on the way to work. You’re not going to miss me!'” She said an older man came up to her car and helped calm her until the police arrived. Officers helped her out of her totaled car, at which point Frutos realized that Laxamana had fallen off. Frutos said she feels a strange connection with the girl who came tumbling down from the sky onto her car. She would like to think that her car helped absorb some of the impact, giving Laxamana time to say goodbye to her family before passing away in a hospital the following day. Frutos even went to Laxamana’s school, Giaudrone Middle School, later that night to see the candlelight vigil. “There was this little boy obsessively trying to keep her candles lit,” she said. “He said she was like a sister to him, and that kind of made me break down.” But Frutos admitted she and her family also have other emotions over the incident. Laxamana nearly took Frutos with her to the grave, after all, and the accident totaled the Frutos family’s only car. “I’m kind of angry about it,” Frutos said. “My family is, too.” Frutos’s sister has set up a Go Fund Me account to assist the family, but the page has been attacked by people who think it’s insensitive to Laxamana’s memory. “Give me a … break,” one person wrote. “This is gross.” Frutos said friends and doctors have warned her she could suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. And, after several days of tears, she now mostly feels numb. Normally an effusive person, she finds herself saying little, even to her closest friends. Laxamana’s tiny, tumbling body and crudely cut hair remain seared in her memory. “The night after it happened, I had a dream that she lived and that I actually went and saw her in the hospital,” Frutos said. “And I told her suicide isn’t a way out. I had a dream that I pretty much helped her get out of that suicidal mindset. And in my dream, she listened to me because I was the person she fell on. So I felt like we did have that connection.” But then Frutos woke up and learned that Laxamana had died. Her dream had been a cruel joke. “I’m never going to forget about this little girl,” Frutos said. “But I need to move on with my family and not be stuck on it.”	150	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 363, ""text"": ""e hair that haunts her.

The Maryland Senate on Thursday gave final approval to Gov. Martin O’Malley’s far-reaching gun-control legislation and advanced a measure restructuring the Prince George’s County school system. The schools bill passed 39 to 7 and went to the House, where its prospects for passage in the coming days appeared strong. The gun bill, which passed 28 to 19, was sent to the governor’s desk, and aides said O’Malley (D) would sign it into law as early as next week. As expected, Senate Democrats signed off on changes made to the gun bill in the House of Delegates rather than risk running out of time working on a compromise before the legislative session ends Monday. Senate Republicans and some rural Democrats objected passionately. They said Senate leaders were choosing political expediency, especially in the area of access to guns by residents with mental-health problems. “The fact is the Firearm Safety Act of 2013 provides no safety,” said Senate Minority Leader E.J. Pipkin (R-Cecil). “It says, if you own guns, we’re coming for you. That’s the message.” Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) pushed back against the criticism. “This bill is a compromise. It says to law-abiding gun owners like myself . . . and I have what some have called an arsenal . . . any gun that you have right now is protected,” Miller said. “All it is is prospective — for people in the future” who buy guns. In a statement, O’Malley called the bill “a comprehensive, common-sense approach to licensing and gun safety.” The law, which is scheduled to go into effect Oct. 1, will give Maryland some of the nation’s most restrictive gun measures. The state will ban magazines that hold more than 10 bullets and will ban 45 types of semiautomatic rifles, classifying them as assault weapons. It will also require those seeking to buy any gun other than a hunting rifle or shotgun to obtain a license, a process that will include submitting fingerprints to police, passing classroom and firing-range training and undergoing more extensive background checks. O’Malley, whose second-floor State House office is near the Senate balcony, made a brief appearance in the gallery, watching the last of more than 60 hours of public testimony and debate that also drew among the largest crowds to Annapolis in three decades. Also in the gallery was Prince George’s County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, who watched the Senate debate a bill that would give him power to select the county’s new school superintendent, appoint three new members to the Board of Education and choose the board’s chairman and vice chairman. Baker (D) had sought a complete overhaul of the struggling school system, arguing that its performance hindered the county’s ability to attract businesses and new residents. The compromise, though far short of what Baker initially sought, would still give Baker more authority over the county’s schools than any other county executive in Maryland. The measure advanced after objections from Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), who called the legislation a “bad plan” that would give Baker power without setting any guidance for improving student achievement. A handful of other senators also objected, saying the county appeared to be getting special treatment on a bill introduced late in the session by Baker and supported by Miller. Miller called Baker “very courageous.” He said the measure would allow residents to hold someone accountable for student progress. Sen. Paul G. Pinsky (D-Prince George’s) defended the measure, saying Prince George’s is facing an urgent situation, hiring a new superintendent after having seven at the helm over 14 years. The action on gun control and the Prince George’s schools came amid a busy day during which lawmakers advanced dozens of other bills. The Senate sent a bill to the governor on a 36 to 11 vote that is designed to help implement the federal health-care law in Maryland. Another bill given final approval by the Senate would make cyberbullying a crime. The bill was introduced after last year’s suicide of a 15-year-old Howard County girl. The girl’s family said she took her life after being harassed online. The case sparked international interest. “American Idol” stars sent out tweets of support, and Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice campaigned on behalf of the measure. Under the legislation, creating a fake profile, posing as a minor, posting real or doctored images of a minor and signing up a minor for a pornographic Web site would be misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in jail and a $500 fine. The Senate also signed off unanimously on a bill that will eventually boost annual state education spending in Prince George’s by more than $13 million a year, another Baker priority. The House on Thursday advanced a measure to give illegal immigrants driver’s licenses. Meanwhile, a conference of House and Senate lawmakers signed off on a compromise of the state’s nearly $37 billion budget, increasing spending 3 percent in the fiscal year beginning in July. John Wagner contributed to this report.	149	"[{""start"": 3939, ""end"": 4217, ""text"": ""Another bill given final approval by the Senate would make cyberbullying a crime.

Parents, teachers and students at W. T. Woodson High School in Fairfax have been reeling in recent months after two students died from apparent suicide within days of each other. The two deaths are among six suspected suicides that have occurred among students at the school since 2011. No other school in Fairfax County has had such a high rate of suicide among its teen students. The parents of five of the six teens spoke to The Washington Post about how the deaths of their children have changed their own lives. The Post generally does not identify youths suspected of killing themselves, but the families agreed to speak about their children. Other parents in the school community are searching for answers for why Woodson appears to have a higher rate than do other schools. Compared with other states, Virginia’s youth suicide rate of 4.9 per 100,000 is slightly behind the nationwide average of 5.1 per 100,000 among children aged 13-18. Below is a breakdown of the statistics within Virginia and Fairfax County for the past five years for suicide among children aged 10-19. From the Virginia Department of Health: 2009: 43 suicide deaths in Virginia for a rate of 4.2 per 100,000, four of which occurred in Fairfax County for a rate of 3.0 per 100,000. 2010: 45 suicide deaths in the state for a rate of 4.2, seven of which occurred in Fairfax County for a rate of 5.0 per 100,000. 2011: 52 suicide deaths in the state for a rate of 4.9, four of which occurred in Fairfax County for a rate of 2.8. One of the four in Fairfax was Woodson student Nick Stuban. 2012: 47 suicide deaths in the state for a rate of 4.4, six of which occurred in Fairfax County for a rate of 4.2. Two of the deaths in Fairfax were of Woodson students Cameron Kilby and Bryan Glenn. 2013: 48 suicide deaths in the state, 10 of which occurred in Fairfax County. One of those deaths was of Woodson student Ethan Griffith. (The rates have not been calculated yet as the census data is incomplete for 2013.) In 2014, two Fairfax County high schools account for four suicide deaths. In both instances, teen boys died a day apart. The first two suicides involved students associated with Langley High School in February. The second two suicides occurred later in the month and involved two students from Woodson, Jack Chen and another teen boy, who has not been identified publicly.	148	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 380, ""text"": ""ts, teachers and students at W.

And now, we wait. We wait for Jean Peters Baker, the special prosecutor appointed for Nodaway County, and her team in the Jackson County prosecuting attorney’s office to discover what charges should be filed regarding the events of the early morning hours of Jan. 8. 2012 in Maryville, Mo. We wait for justice. It’s hard not to have an opinion about this case, especially after reading the investigative report in the Kansas City Star and the essay for xojane.com written by Daisy Coleman, who was just 14 when she was allegedly raped by Matthew Barnett, a high school senior, after he gave her alcohol to drink. I am trying to practice restraint and not convict Barnett in the court of public opinion for what he may have done to Daisy while she was drunk. Same for his friend, Jordan Zech, also a senior, who is said to have videotaped Barnett and Coleman with his cellphone. (I do blame them, though, and not the town of Maryville, where I grew up, although many find the entire community at fault.) My best friend, Debra, waits as well. She just drove her 21-year-old daughter, Emily (names have been changed at their request to protect their privacy) from Overland Park, Kan., to Chicago, to a residential treatment facility that treats young women suffering from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anorexia. All of those problems started after Emily was raped by five high school hockey players at a party five years ago. That was before Steubenville and Maryville. Before Rehtaeh Parsons and Audrie Pott, two young rape victims who committed suicide. It’s been said we have an epidemic of rape in this country. And it didn’t just start in January of 2012 in Maryville or in August of 2012 in Steubenville. It’s been going on for who knows how long, and it’s been covered up and whispered about because victims find it easier to stay quiet. Except it isn’t really easier. And it isn’t just the rape.  It’s the aftermath — the name-calling, the cyber-bullying and the “slut-shaming” — that’s humiliated them and discouraged them and chipped away at their self-esteem. It’s like “Mean Girls” on steroids. “My whole life since January 8, 2012, has been a long, reckless winter,” Coleman wrote in her online essay. She explains why she started cutting herself. “I saw myself as ugly, inside and out. If I was this ugly on the inside, then why shouldn’t everyone see the ugly I saw? “I burned and carved the ugly I saw into my arms, wrists, legs and anywhere I could find room.” She also attempted suicide twice. So has Emily, who slept with a kitchen knife under her bed,  thinking she would use it on herself. Coleman’s bullying intensified after felony charges were dropped against Barnett and Zech in March 2012; she was taunted in tweets with the hashtag #JordanAndMattAreFree. I don’t understand how girls can turn on other girls. But they do. Two girls faced charges of making threats against the rape victim after the young men were convicted in the Steubenville case. More shocking: CNN reporter Poppy Harlow told anchor Candy Crowley, “It was incredibly emotional, incredibly difficult even for an outsider like me to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures — star football players, very good students — we literally watched as they believe their life fell apart.” What about the girls who have to live with the memories of rape for the rest of their lives? Five years later, Emily is still struggling with the memories of that one night.  Debra wonders if life will ever be normal for her daughter. Therapists told her that Emily could qualify for disability; that’s how severe her emotional impairment is. Debra and her husband talked to an attorney about pressing charges against the boys who attacked their daughter. She didn’t want them to get away with it. She didn’t want them to do it to another girl. But it’s too late. Despite Kansas no longer having a statute of limitations for rape cases, there’s no physical evidence. There’s no justice for Emily. Nor is there for most rape victims: Sixty percent of rapes in the past five years were never even reported to law enforcement, and only three out of 100 rapists serve time in prison, according to RAINN. Debra wants Emily’s story told. It may be the only justice her daughter will ever have, although Debra said she hoped the events of that night would haunt the souls of the young men who raped Emily.  “If they have souls.” I suggested that when they had their own families, they would understand what they had done as teenagers to hurt Emily.  Maybe they would make sure their sons treated women with respect. “No,” she said. “I want them to have daughters.”	147	"[{""start"": 481, ""end"": 612, ""text"": ""Coleman, who was just 14 when she was allegedly raped by Matthew Barnett, a high school senior, after he gave her alcohol to drink."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 758, ""end"": 877, ""text"": ""Same for his friend, Jordan Zech, also a senior, who is said to have videotaped Barnett and Coleman with his cellphone."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1041, ""end"": 1438, ""text"": ""She just drove her 21-year-old daughter, Emily (names have been changed at their request to protect their privacy) from Overland Park, Kan., to Chicago, to a residential treatment facility that treats young women suffering from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anorexia.

A veteran Maryland lawmaker and a relative newcomer with a familiar name are locked in a tight battle to become the state’s next attorney general, according to a new Washington Post poll. With less than two weeks until the Democratic primary, enough voters are undecided for the race to swing in either direction. Del. Jon S. Cardin (Baltimore County) narrowly leads Sen. Brian E. Frosh (Montgomery) among likely Democratic voters, the poll finds. Twenty-six percent say they support Cardin, compared with 20 percent for Frosh, within the poll’s seven-point error margin. But Frosh’s support has roughly tripled since February, while Cardin’s hasn’t budged. Del. Aisha N. Braveboy (Prince George’s) is running third, at 13 percent. A whopping 40 percent of likely Democratic voters say they have no preferred candidate or are totally disengaged, leaving open the possibility of significant shifts before the June 24 primary. The winner will be heavily favored in November’s general election matchup against Republican Jeffrey Pritzker and Libertarian Leo Wayne Dymowski, given the high number of registered Democrats in the state. “People are generally not paying attention,” said Donald F. Norris, chairman of the Department of Public Policy at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. “I’m not sure whose advantage that is.” A state delegate since 2003, Cardin, 44, has based his campaign on fighting Internet crime, saying that he is best prepared to be the state’s chief lawyer in the digital age. Frosh, 67, is trying to energize voters based on his 28 years in the State House, where he has built a reputation for solid leadership even as he has angered some interest groups for his deliberate approach. The subtext has been Cardin’s name recognition and his infamy — the former because of his uncle, U.S. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), and the latter because of several judgment lapses, starting with the use of an on-duty police patrol boat to stage a marriage proposal in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor in 2009. Frosh has tried to score points by questioning Cardin’s conduct in Annapolis. But he is struggling, despite strong fundraising and a raft of endorsements from his party’s establishment, to grab voters’ attention. “It’s probably too close to call,” said Irwin L. Morris, chairman of the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland at College Park. “I wouldn’t be willing to put money on it — if I were a betting man.” Overshadowed by relatives For three terms, Cardin has held the same legislative seat in Annapolis that his uncle, grandfather and great-uncle held before him. Cardin also works as a general practice lawyer in downtown Baltimore, in the brick building where his uncle once practiced law. “It is clearly possible,” Norris said, that Cardin’s lead in the polls “has eroded as people learn he is not Ben Cardin.” As a delegate, Cardin successfully sponsored bills that criminalized online bullying and sexual harassment, including “Grace’s Law,” named in honor of a Howard County teen who killed herself after being taunted on social media. He says he is eager to lead Maryland’s fight against online crime, rooting out Internet scammers and preventing identity theft. “It really gets me crazy when children are the victims,” Cardin said. “Cybercrime is destroying lives.” Roundup of candidate profiles, debate and issues stories, poll data and other reports on the races. Cardin, who chairs the House of Delegates’ election-law subcommittee, helped pass laws to enfranchise voters, advocating for same-day registration and blocking voter-identification measures. “Jon talks through issues and tries to build consensus,” said Del. Eric M. Bromwell (D-Baltimore County), who said Cardin convinced him of the merits of a campaign finance law. Del. John A. Olszewski Jr. (D-Baltimore County) said Cardin is “a good guy, a hard worker, and is more than just a last name.” But Frosh and many of his colleagues say Cardin lacks the judgment and experience that an attorney general needs. They were outraged when Cardin welcomed, then rejected, an off-the-cuff endorsement from a rapper with a long rap sheet. And they excoriated him for missing 75 percent of committee votes during this year’s legislative session but requesting nearly full reimbursement for meals in Annapolis. Cardin said he did all the work required for the bills under consideration but often left in the evenings to help his wife through a difficult pregnancy. His committee votes “would’ve made zero difference,” he said, because the bills in question passed unanimously. Del. Sheila E. Hixson (D-Montgomery), chairwoman of the House Ways and Means Committee, agreed that Cardin never neglected his job but said his absences were unusual. “No one comes close to that number,” Hixson said. Standing up to controversy Frosh’s supporters point to the senator’s work on landmark legislation — gun control, cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay and repealing the death penalty, among others — as proof that he should become attorney general. “He’s never been accused of not using good judgment,” said Gov. Martin O’Malley (D). “And each and every time we faced some issues that had the capacity to pull us apart, Brian Frosh always found a way to bring us together.” Frosh learned politics from his father, Stanley B. Frosh, a former Montgomery County judge who took on Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and pushed for racial integration in county government. He was known for giving first-time offenders alternatives to jail time. “It was his example that taught me the importance of fighting for justice,” said Frosh, a civil litigator from Bethesda who was first elected a state lawmaker in 1986 and now chairs the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. Watching his father take hits for his progressive stances emboldened the younger Frosh during tough battles in the State House. The hardest, he said, was pushing for stricter gun-control measures. “We had 2,000 people testify, and 1,950 were opposed to it,” he said. In the Post poll, Frosh runs strongest among Democrats with post-graduate degrees. He has seen a jolt of support from white Democrats, though Cardin outperforms him overall in that demographic group, as well as in the Baltimore suburbs and in rural parts of the state. Cardin has criticized Frosh for using his power as a committee chairman to kill bills he didn’t like. Detractors say Frosh can be dismissive of those who have different views. Colby Simon, a child-abuse survivor, said she got a frosty reception when she sought help drafting a bill to punish those who fail to report abuse. “Frosh holds so much power,” Simon said. “He can control what gets voted on and what doesn’t.” Frosh angered some advocates by helping to kill a version of “Jessica’s Law” proposed in Maryland in 2007 as part of a national push to set mandatory-minimum sentences for sex offenders. Frosh said he believes mandatory-minimum sentences are bad policy and wants judges to have discretion in sentencing. But in 2010, a different version of the bill passed with Frosh’s support. “You are balancing victims’ rights with due process,” said Del. Kathleen M. Dumais (D-Montgomery), vice chairwoman of the House Judiciary Committee. “And many times, nobody is happy.” Frosh “has been an ally,” said Lisae Jordan, executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault. “He hears thousands of bills. Some are strong, and some aren’t.” Baltimore resident Kathleen Rivelois, 70, said she plans to vote for Frosh because “he has earned the respect of many.” But she added that she could change her mind if she finds out Cardin is “anything like his uncle.” ‘Community connection’ Braveboy, who is far behind in the three-way primary race, is a star in Prince George’s County — where she worships, where she graduated from Largo High School and where her base, middle-class black families, is anchored. In the Post poll, she won the support of 18 percent of black Democrats, compared with 3 percent of whites (Cardin performs similarly among blacks, with 20 percent support). The 39-year-old real-estate lawyer has represented her district in the legislature since 2007. She chairs the Legislative Black Caucus and has focused her lawmaking efforts on a minimum-wage increase, efforts to boost minority business participation and legislation to protect homeowners. Her constituents love her for it. As attorney general, Braveboy said, she would hold banks accountable for predatory practices. When Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Robert Bell called on lawyers to take foreclosure cases free during the height of the housing crisis, Braveboy responded — aware that the crash had struck Prince George’s as hard as anywhere in the state. Braveboy also helped launch a program run by the nonprofit Olde Mill Foundation that has diverted about 3,000 juvenile offenders out of the criminal justice system. Cardin and Frosh “don’t have the community connection Aisha has,” said Phil Lee, executive director of the foundation. “She knows. She understands. This what she does. It’s something she was destined to do.” Voter awareness On a recent afternoon, Cardin was greeting constituents at a Baltimore County Jewish women’s luncheon when a family friend approached, looking for a hug. “Why haven’t I seen your signs up?” a bewildered Cathy Litofsky asked. “Are you not running?” Cardin sighed before turning to a reporter and saying, “I get this all the time.” For the first time in 50 years, the state is asking voters to turn out for a summertime election, which experts expect to draw historically low numbers. The Post poll finds that significantly fewer Democrats are following the primary races this year than in 2010. On average, the attorney general’s contest nets about 200,000 fewer votes than the governor’s race, according Maryland State Board of Elections data. Of the three attorney general candidates, Frosh seems best positioned to benefit from a low-turnout contest. Nearly three-quarters of registered Democrats who support him say they are “absolutely certain” they will vote, compared with just more than half of Cardin’s supporters. Retired mechanic Tex Miller of Salisbury said this year’s primary sneaked up on him. Without a computer at home, the 66-year-old relies on listening to the radio at the shop where he restores antique Jeeps for information about candidates. “I’ve heard all the names, and I heard tidbits,” Miller said. He said he considers the attorney general’s race important but so far has “sort of ignored” it. “I shouldn’t do that,” Miller said. “But it’s the way it is.” Mark Weaver, of the Southwest Baltimore County Democratic Club, is backing Frosh. But given Cardin’s name recognition, he thinks the senator’s chances of winning are iffy. “Everyone is worried about turnout,” said Weaver, who is e-mailing all his friends to remind them about the primary. “That makes the races hard to predict.” Peyton M.

Tysen Benz was in his room when he read text messages saying someone he knew had committed suicide. Shortly after, the 11-year-old boy from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula hanged himself. Now, a 13-year-old girl is facing criminal charges in his death. Marquette County Prosecuting Attorney Matt Wiese said the girl posed as someone else when she faked her own death during a text conversation with Tysen. The boy, for reasons still unclear, believed it and killed himself within two hours of receiving the messages, Wiese said. Wiese said he could not confirm the relationship between Tysen and the girl, but media reports say she was his girlfriend. “The impact that it had on the boy — there’s a logical connection,” Wiese told The Washington Post. “He did this within hours of the conversation happening via text.” The girl, whose name was not released, has been charged with malicious use of telecommunication service, punishable by up to six months in juvenile detention, and using a computer to commit a crime, which can carry up to a year in detention. Both are misdemeanor charges. The incident happened March 14. Nothing seemed amiss when Tysen returned home from school that day, said the boy’s mother, Katrina Goss of Marquette, Mich. He seemed happy and was proud that he had gone to his tutoring session without being reminded, Goss told The Post. She baked him some treats as a reward. After dinner, Tysen went to his room. Shortly after 10 p.m., Goss went to each of her three sons’ rooms to tuck them in. Tysen’s door was locked, but she was able to open it with her key. At first, she thought her middle son was hiding or playing a trick because he wasn’t in his bed. “I went in and I thought he was being silly,” Goss told The Post. “I ended up finding him in the closet . … I tried to hurry up and lift him up. I was screaming. I told my oldest son to call 911. My littlest one was bawling.” Goss said the paramedics were able to revive Tysen. The boy was hospitalized for three weeks before he died April 4. His funeral is scheduled for Tuesday night in Marquette. In his obituary, Tysen was described as a boy who loved sports and spent many summers diving off cliffs. “He was never idle, always active each and every day,” the obituary states. “Tysen’s years may have been brief on this earth, but every single one was filled with so many joyous and eventful activities that he lived more in his short life than most do in a full lifetime.” Goss said her son often used Snapchat. The night he died, she said he was texting and talking on Snapchat with the 13-year-old girl, who was using someone else’s account when she told Tysen that his girlfriend had died. No one warned her son that it was all a prank, Goss said. “She used her friend’s account to make it even more proof that she’d died,” Goss said. “He was so innocent, so kindhearted and so naive that he completely believed her and he took his own life.” Wiese, the prosecutor, said there was some reference to Snapchat in the text exchange, but it’s unclear what was said on the social media app because investigators have been unable to obtain those messages. In an interview with the Associated Press, Goss described her son’s death as the result of “a twisted, sick joke” delivered in the form of cyberbullying on social media. She said she wants to raise awareness about how social media platforms influence children’s actions. “I want him to basically be the face of the cause. It’s a serious issue that I feel is completely skirted,” Goss said. “The way that children are using social media currently in this day and age is just terrible.” Goss said her son and the girl were attending the same school. Although the prank happened outside of school, she said officials have failed to do enough to protect her son. The Post was unable to reach the girl or her family, and it was not immediately clear whether she has a lawyer. In a statement released Thursday, Marquette Area Public Schools Superintendent William Saunders said school officials agree with Goss’s statements about the dangers of social media, but their knowledge of the incident is limited because it happened outside school. “The loss of Tysen has been felt by all of his teachers, classmates and well beyond our school walls, by our entire community. The loss of a student and classmate is the most difficult thing a school is ever asked to deal with, but pales in comparison to what the family must be going through,” Saunders said. “After the gut wrenching loss of a student we ask ourselves, ‘How can we do more?’ ” he added. “To that answer we look forward to partnering with parents and the community to double our efforts in educating all.” Wiese said he would describe Tysen’s death as more of the result of a hoax, though he said he would not disagree with Goss’s assessment that it’s a form of cyberbullying. In 2011, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) signed a bill requiring schools to have anti-bullying policies in place. The bill, called “Matt’s Safe School Law,” was named for a 14-year-old who killed himself in 2002 after he was assaulted at school. About 1 in 5 students during the 2012-13 school year reported being bullied either through insults, rumors or physical harm, according to a 2015 report by the U.S. Department of Education. Cyberbullying was less frequent and affected about 1 in 14 students. According to a 2016 study by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the number of suicides among adolescents has increased dramatically in recent decades. The study found that being a victim of bullying has a “clear relationship” with committing or thinking of committing suicide. Furthermore, the study also found that excessive Internet use was “strongly associated with higher levels of depression” and thoughts or attempts to commit suicide. Goss said her son, an athlete who played hockey, travel soccer and golf, did not have any underlying issues that would’ve hinted that he’d hurt himself. “He was perfectly happy and fine. There was no additional sadness that was occurring. He had tons of friends,” she said. “Anybody who knows him knows he’s a shining star.” READ MORE: Facebook hopes artificial intelligence can curb the ‘terribly tragic’ trend of suicides ‘We lost one of our angels’: Family claims Texas teen who committed suicide was cyberbullied Suicide contagion and social media: The dangers of sharing ‘Genie, you’re free’	145	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 247, ""text"": ""Benz was in his room when he read text messages saying someone he knew had committed suicide.

Three California boys were arrested Thursday in connection with the sexual assault of a girl who later committed suicide, reports the Associated Press: “After an extensive investigation that we have conducted on behalf of the family, there is no doubt in our minds that the victim, then only 15 years old, was savagely assaulted by her fellow high school students while she lay on a bed completely unconscious,” [family attorney Robert Allard] said. Allard said students used cell phones to share photos of the assaults and the images went viral. Santa Clara County sheriff’s Lt. Jose Cardoza said two of the teens were arrested at Saratoga High School and the third, a former Saratoga High student, at Christopher High School in Gilroy. The names of the suspects were not released because they are minors. Details about the assault were also not released. In a similar case, a Canadian girl died in Halifax on Sunday. She hanged herself, her mother said, 18 months after she was reportedly raped by four boys at a party. One of the alleged perpetrators took a photo of the incident with his phone, and that photo was publicized on Facebook and distributed widely via e-mail, according to the victim’s father. Royal Canadian Mounted Police declined to prosecute the case after a long investigation, saying that the evidence was insufficient. The provincial justice minister has said he is looking to review how the police handled the case. “This isn’t an isolated case,” Diana Reese writes. The rape conviction of two Steubenville, Ohio boys last month has focused national attention on the combination of rape and social media, and on the shame victims of rape experience when images of their assaults are made public. Cellphone photos shared online by the accused in the Steubenville case were part of the evidence against them. Melinda Henneberger excoriates journalists covering that case for sympathizing with the defendants: On NBC, Lester Holt told viewers, “In many ways, tonight stands as a cautionary tale to a generation that has come of age in the era of social networking.” Hello, Mr. Holt? That almost sounds as though you think the takeaway is that rapists should have sense enough not to implicate themselves. Good thing there were some women covering the story. Oh, but they included CNN’s Candy Crowley, who said to the reporter covering the trial, “I cannot imagine, watching this on the feed coming in, how emotional that must have been sitting in the courtroom” when the judge handed down the verdicts.

When three teenage girls from Denver left their homes for an Islamic State camp in Syria two months ago, their parents — and the FBI — were quick to search social media for clues to their escape. And in the weeks since the girls were intercepted in Frankfurt and returned home, it’s become pretty clear that they were indeed radicalized and recruited online. But while accounts of similar Western recruits have fingered major social networks like Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr, or popular messaging platforms like Kik, a report out from NPR claims another social network, Ask.fm, was actually the major force at play. Which means Ask.fm — late of several recent cyberbullying and teen suicide scandals — may now officially qualify as the worst-reputed social network on earth. But don’t tell that to the site’s new owner, the blue-chip Internet company IAC: Ask.fm’s new owners are confident they can save the site, trolls and terrorists be damned. “I absolutely believe rehabilitation is possible if you do the right thing,” said Doug Leeds, the site’s CEO. “There is that perception that [Ask.fm] is a parent’s worst nightmare … but safety is our first priority.” Unfortunately for Leeds, that reputation has dogged Ask.fm since its beginning. The anonymous question-and-answer site — both a pioneer and an early warning, in the anonymous networking space — was founded in Latvia in 2010, and quickly grew to more than 100 million users in 150 countries. Its premise, both simple and mind-numbingly self-involved, is perfect for the teenage set: Essentially, when you log into Ask.fm, you’re greeted by a series of personal questions other users have left for you, with no indication of who wrote them or how they know you in real life. You, in turn, get to pontificate to the anonymous masses on topics like “what do you do to fall asleep?” and “what’s the most delicious fruit?” — as well as, naturally, ask anonymous questions, yourself. The problem, of course, is when users tire of mundane topics like sleeping and fruit and start to post other, darker questions. Like “why are you so ugly?” Or “why haven’t you died yet?” Or “do you know how I can join ISIS?” Tellingly, the first time Ask.fm ever appeared in the English media was in relation to the 2012 suicide of 15-year-old Ciara Pugsley. “Last year we had never heard about Ask.fm,” an anti-bullying activist told Ireland’s Daily Mirror at the time, “but this year is is popping up everywhere … Now every school we visit mentions this website.” In the year following Pugley’s death, no fewer than nine teenage suicides were linked to the site, including two in the U.S. In December 2012, 16-year-old Jessica Laney hanged herself after receiving a series of cruel messages and insults about her personal life. Less than a year later, 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick jumped from an abandoned cement silo in Lakeland, Fla., after receiving anonymous messages like “nobody cares about u” and “you seriously deserve to die.” Ask.fm’s founders were originally pretty casual, even callous, about this kind of tragedy: blame your children, not the tool, is basically how Mark Terebin put it during the rash of suicides in early 2013. When the site was bought by blue chip Internet giant IAC last August, Terebin and his brother Ilya were unceremoniously pushed out. In their wake, the new Ask.fm doubled the size of its human moderation team, hired two senior safety officers — including Catherine Teitelbaum, the former head of global safety for Yahoo — and rolled out a range of new automated moderation tools that could flag questionable content even before users reported it. “We looked at Ask.fm a long time” before buying it, Leeds said. “We were concerned, but we were also intrigued … The safety issues with Ask.fm are well-documented. So safety was our first priority.” Ask.fm inked agreements with the Attorney Generals’ Offices of New York and Maryland, vowing to to crack down on abuse and underage users; earlier this month, the company announced it would move its headquarters from Latvia to Ireland, changing its privacy policy, terms of use and enforcement jurisdiction in the process. Ask.fm’s first rule of content now prohibits any posts meant “to harass, scare or upset anyone;” the second bans provocative or antagonistic content, “especially trolling.” And yet, while Ask.fm may have rid itself of trolls, it now seems to face an even more dangerous predator. The Middle East Media Research Institute, a non-profit that monitors and translates Middle Eastern press, included Ask.fm in its recent list of social media companies “instrumental in spreading al-Qaeda’s ideologogy to the younger generation,” especially teenagers in the West. There are “hundreds, if not thousands” of jihadist accounts on Ask.fm, the report claims, which answer questions from people interested in joining their cause. In Ask.fm’s defense, it’s by no means alone here: MEMRI’s report also singles out half a dozen other social networks, including Facebook and Twitter. But since half of Ask.fm’s users are under 18, it offers up a particularly vulnerable demographic to extremist recruiters in the Middle East. “Hi Abu — how important is social media to ISIS?” One user asked an alleged British jihadist, going under the username Abu Abdullah. “I think u know how important it is,” Abu Abdullah wrote back. “Its a valuable tool for recruitment if anyone wna join and to show the real ISIS.” As if to prove Abu Abdullah’s claims, the three would-be teen jihadists from Denver apparently made extensive contact with Islamic State recruiters on Ask.fm, NPR reports. In fact, of all the social networks the girls used, it’s Ask.fm where their radicalization played out most clearly, says a report by SITE Intelligence Group, a company that tracks jihadists’ online activity. At one point, SITE observed, an anonymous user asked one of the Denver girls how much she listened to music, and she said three hours a day. Months later, an anonymous user asked her favorite song to dance to — and she did a 180, saying “music is haram” (meaning sinful or forbidden). It was nothing that would have come up in a keyword filter — but concerning, all the same. “It’s a really tough issue,” said Teitelbaum, the newly hired Chief of Trust & Safety. “The language itself is benign — the tone of the conversations is actually very casual. There’s very little reference to violence. It’s not like other areas of abuse.” So Ask.fm has had to find different ways to confront it: the site very recently added an “extremism” category to its reporting tool, and it’s working more closely with law enforcement to identify and monitor potentially dangerous accounts. But still, despite all these efforts, it seems extremely difficult for Ask.fm to turn its image around. Nine teen suicides and three would-be terrorists? If that’s not a parent’s worst nightmare, I don’t know what is. “This provides a social utility,” Leeds assures me. “This is an important part of people expressing themselves.” But he really only needs to convince parents and politicians; clearly, with 180 million monthly users, he already has us kids.	142	"[{""start"": 617, ""end"": 774, ""text"": ""Which means Ask.fm — late of several recent cyberbullying and teen suicide scandals — may now officially qualify as the worst-reputed social network on earth"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2167, ""end"": 2299, ""text"": ""Tellingly, the first time Ask.fm ever appeared in the English media was in relation to the 2012 suicide of 15-year-old Ciara Pugsley"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2508, ""end"": 2976, ""text"": ""In the year following Pugley’s death, no fewer than nine teenage suicides were linked to the site, including two in the U.S. In December 2012, 16-year-old Jessica Laney hanged herself after receiving a series of cruel messages and insults about her personal life.

Sheryl Moore’s son lay on the bed before her. Soon, she knew, her 16-year-old boy would be taken off life support — another life lost to bullying. Alexander “AJ” Betts Jr. attempted suicide in July 2013, the Des Moines Register reported at the time. He died shortly thereafter. Betts’s mother said he had been outed as gay about a year and half before his death. His friends told KCCI that schoolmates constantly made fun of him, ridiculing him for being gay, for being half African American, and for his cleft lip. “He’s different. He doesn’t add up to what they’re used to,” Noah Lahmann, the teen’s best friend, told the news station. Before he died, Betts had a request: Donate my organs. A 14-year-old boy received Betts’s heart, according to a letter Moore received, but she said his eyes were rejected. A Food and Drug Administration’s guidance for donor eligibility says men who have had sex with men in the past five years “should” be ruled as “ineligible” for donating certain tissues, labeling their behavior a “risk factor.” “My initial feeling was just very angry because I couldn’t understand why my 16-year-old son’s eyes couldn’t be donated just because he was gay,” Moore said, according to KCCI. The FDA’s guidance reflects its ban on blood from men who have sex with men. That policy is a by-product of the AIDS crisis that ripped through the gay men’s community decades ago. The FDA explains its much harder line regarding blood as such: Men who have had sex with men “at any time since 1977 (the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States) are currently deferred as blood donors” because “a history of male-to-male sex is associated with an increased risk for exposure to and transmission of certain infectious diseases, including HIV.” Critics have long called the policy discriminatory, but the FDA says it’s necessary: “FDA’s deferral policy is based on the documented increased risk of certain transfusion transmissible infections, such as HIV, associated with male-to-male sex and is not based on any judgment concerning the donor’s sexual orientation.” In the Journal of the American Medical Association, Glenn Cohen, a bioethics law professor at the Harvard Law School, wrote that the United States should repeal the rules about blood. “We think it’s time for the FDA to take a serious look at this policy, because it’s out of step with peer countries, it’s out of step with modern medicine, it’s out of step with public opinion, and we feel it may be legally problematic,” he told CBS.  Cohen notes some contradictions in the FDA blood ban: Men who have sex with HIV-positive women or sex workers are banned for only a year. Last summer, the American Medical Association voted to end the ban. According to Time magazine, William Kobler, a board member for the the association, said in a statement, “The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science.” In an e-mail to Time, a spokesman for the FDA wrote, “Although scientific evidence has not yet demonstrated that blood donated by [men who have sex with men] or a subgroup of these potential donors does not have a substantially increased rate of HIV infection compared to currently accepted blood donors, the FDA remains willing to consider new approaches to donor screening and testing.”  Rules, guidelines and recommendations governing organ and tissue donation are not as clear as the FDA’s ban on blood. The nonprofit organization United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has a contract to facilitate organ procurement and transplants in United States. That contract covers “specified solid organs” such as hearts, livers, lungs and kidneys, but not eyes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On top of that, it adds, “Technically, all UNOS policies are voluntary.” In Betts’s case, his liver, lungs, kidneys and heart all found recipients. Unlike blood, as long as a recipient gives consent to any associated potential risks (such as HIV transmission) after counseling, certain organs can be donated. But because his mother could not confirm to the donor network that her son hadn’t been sexually active in the five years before his death, Betts’s eyes were rejected. “This is archaic,” Moore told KCCI. “And it is just silly that people wouldn’t get the life-saving assistance they need because of regulations that are 30 years old.”	141	"[{""start"": 116, ""end"": 146, ""text"": ""another life lost to bullying."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 147, ""end"": 514, ""text"": ""Alexander “AJ” Betts Jr. attempted suicide in July 2013, the Des Moines Register reported at the time.

Stop the bullying!! #teammiaPlease help us make this video go viral this is not ok and it’s time to take a stand!!!STOP THE BULLYING #teammia Posted by Nena Bella on Sunday, January 31, 2016   On the list of evils associated with today’s Internet, cyberbullying surely deserves a spot near the top. Hardly a week goes by without some story of humiliation caused by the release of malicious footage taken by the perpetrators of beatings or of spying on someone’s intimate moments or worse. But here’s a case where it appears that the victim turned the tables and used the footage taken by her tormentors as payback. It happened in Philadelphia and the table-turner, by her account at least, was 16-year-old Mia DeJesus. According to DeJesus, four classmates at Philadelphia’s Northeast High School ganged up and “kicked, hit and taunted” her in a bullying attack in a locked bathroom. She says she blacked out during the incident on Jan. 27, but even those unconscious moments were preserved, uploaded and replayed time and time again in an Instagram video her attackers recorded. Soon, all of their classmates had seen it. That was where the bullying would end, she decided. Instead of allowing the video to be used as a tool to continue to terrorize her, DeJesus turned it into a unifying anti-bullying message. “When I saw it, I was embarrassed because people were reposting and laughing about it. It just messed me up in my head,” DeJesus told ABC 7 news in Philadelphia.  “I felt alone and feeling alone, a lot of people feel this way, and nobody really does anything about it,” Mia said. With the support of her mother, she took the video, recorded her own narrative to accompany it, and repurposed it in a post on Facebook days after the incident. “I was assaulted by four girls bigger than me, just because they didn’t like me,” she said.  “I was tortured physically and emotionally and media-wise,” DeJesus said in her narration. “I refuse to be held hostage by this video and my fear. I will not be a victim. I will post this video every day until something is done for all the people who continue to experience this type of humiliation,” she said in the closing words of her recording. With more than 2 million views and thousands of shares, DeJesus’s video is striking a chord among youths nationwide. Victimized students often can’t escape their tormentors even when the school day ends; phones, computers, tweets and posts follow them from dawn to dusk in today’s era of cyberbullying. DeJesus’s message co-opted that cycle of humiliation. Her attackers say the video doesn’t show the whole story of the confrontation, alleging that DeJesus started it with threats and gossiping. DeJesus’s mother stands by her daughter’s story, saying in a Facebook post that “beating someone is unacceptable for any reason and especially someone who isn’t fighting back is bullying.” The school district said it took action against the four students who carried out the beating, but would not characterize it as bullying. “We do not condone this behavior and appropriate action was taken against the four students,” a Philadelphia School District spokesperson told ABC 7 News.. “We would not characterize this as bullying, but rather a neighborhood dispute that spilled over in the school building.” A school representative told NBC 10 that the incident was an escalation of a dispute between two families, and according to its reporting, one of the girls was arrested and is being investigated for aggravated assault. ABC reported that all four were given suspensions, while DeJesus plans to transfer to another school.	140	"[{""start"": 719, ""end"": 1078, ""text"": ""According to DeJesus, four classmates at Philadelphia’s Northeast High School ganged up and “kicked, hit and taunted” her in a bullying attack in a locked bathroom.

When Lauryn Santiago’s grades started to slip two years ago, her mother, Linda Diaz, suspected something was wrong. Diaz called her daughter’s high school and asked the counselor to meet with Lauryn. But the meeting never happened. A month later, Diaz found her 15-year-old daughter hanging from the banister of their home. Lauryn, a freshman at Laurel High School in Prince George’s County, had taken her own life. Diaz told her story to state lawmakers in Annapolis last month as part of a crusade to increase awareness of teen suicide. Her advocacy helped push the General Assembly to approve a bill dubbed “Lauryn’s Law,” which would require that school counselors undergo regular training to recognize signs that students are dealing with mental illness, are in distress or are contemplating suicide. “There is an epidemic,” Diaz said of teen suicide, the second-leading cause of death among people ages 15 to 24. “This is an issue, almost like a bomb waiting to explode.” If the bill is signed into law, Maryland would become the 23rd state to require suicide prevention training for school employees, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Only nine states had such mandates three years ago, the foundation said, although mental-health advocates have been lobbying for such training for years. “Regular education and training for school personnel in how to recognize and respond to signs of suicide risk is a crucial step toward reducing the rate of youth suicide,” said Nicole Gibson, senior manager of state advocacy at the organization. “As children and teens spend a significant amount of their young lives in school, the personnel that interact with them on a daily basis are in a prime position to recognize these signs and make the appropriate referrals for help.” Under the bill, the state’s Professional Standards and Teacher Education Board, which creates standards for teachers and other school personnel, must include mental-health training as a requirement for counselors to maintain their certification. The requirement would take effect in July 2016. The bill must be signed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R), whose spokeswoman said it is under review. There were 4,878 suicides by people ages 15 to 24 in the United States in 2013, up from 3,988 a decade earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationwide survey of students in grades nine to 12, found that 16 percent of students seriously considered suicide in 2013, and 8 percent tried to take their own lives. Some school systems such as Fairfax County have revamped their mental-health policies in response to a spate of teen suicides. The school district used a grant to expand its mental-health first-aid program, and all middle school and high school teachers enrolled in mental-health awareness training last year. Jeremy Goldman, president of the Maryland School Counselor Association, said his organization did not take a position on the legislation in Annapolis but supports any effort to provide counselors with tools to help their students. At the same time, he said, current ratios of students to counselors are too high in most schools and the legislation would limit the impact of counselors trained to recognize and respond to suicide risks. “When school counselors have 500 or 700 students each and are assigned to classroom coverage or hall duty, it makes it more difficult for counselors to intervene,” Goldman said. Del. Joseline A. Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s), who sponsored the legislation, said she recognizes that counselors are overworked. But “if one child is saved because [the training] is fresh on their minds and they can help the parent, to me it is worth it.” Counselors must have a master’s degree to work in Maryland schools, and their graduate studies include training in mental health. The bill would require counselors to receive additional suicide prevention training every five years, when they are recertified. There is no cost to the state for the training, Goldman said, because counselors pay for their own recertification. Peña-Melnyk said the requirement should keep counselors current on new resources and approaches that can be used to identify a child in crisis. During hearings on the bill, she noted nearly a half-dozen instances from the past year in which teenagers from across the state committed suicide. “This is a problem,” she said. “We cannot ignore it.” The hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee at which Diaz and others testified was emotional at times. Del. Sheila E. Hixson (D-Montgomery) was visibly moved, wiping tears from her eyes, as University of Maryland graduate Meg Kimmel shared her story about attempting suicide. Hixson later told the panel that her son took his life. Then Del. Eric G. Luedtke (D-Montgomery) said that his brother attempted suicide at age 22. Hixson and Luedtke praised Diaz and Kimmel for testifying and for trying to remove the stigma associated with suicide. Diaz began volunteering with a suicide prevention group after her daughter’s death. It was there that she learned how to spot signs that someone is at risk and realized that her daughter was in crisis for months before her death. The honor roll student was popular but also painfully shy, Diaz said. She loved selfies, motorcycles and spending time with the family dogs. She also was being criticized by some members of her extended family who had started to question her sexuality. At school, Lauryn was having trouble concentrating. Doctors told Diaz the girl had anemia. They never suggested a therapist, and Diaz didn’t think of it. She says she never learned why the school counselor and Lauryn did not meet. Five weeks after Lauryn’s funeral, one of her friends tried to kill himself. Another friend attempted suicide several months later. Diaz started reading her daughter’s Instagram account and seeing comments from other young people who were considering suicide. She reached out to them. “These were just kids that I knew,” Diaz said. She figured there were more. She urged school officials to hold an assembly focused on suicide prevention. They did. She contacted school district officials about training. Things moved slowly, so she turned to state lawmakers. Diaz said she wants to expand the bill to include training for teachers and other school employees and will try to do so in a future legislative session. “Suicide is preventable,” she said. “And when the adults interacting with our children are given the knowledge they need to recognize warning signs and act, we can save some of these young lives.”	139	"[{""start"": 806, ""end"": 917, ""text"": ""“There is an epidemic,” Diaz said of teen suicide, the second-leading cause of death among people ages 15 to 24"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5, ""end"": 414, ""text"": ""Lauryn Santiago’s grades started to slip two years ago, her mother, Linda Diaz, suspected something was wrong.

  “Guess I am dead. Killed myself. Sorry.” Those were Rachel Bryk’s last words, posted in a posthumous Twitter message to 222 followers at midnight Thursday. Eight hours earlier, the transgender 23-year-old had walked west along the George Washington Bridge connecting upper Manhattan to New Jersey. Drivers stuck in rush hour traffic saw a slight figure with bright pink hair stop midway along the bridge. Bryk took off her shoes. Then she climbed over the guardrail and jumped. In the weeks before her suicide, Bryk, a respected game developer, had complained of “constant transphobia” on the Internet. In online chat rooms, anonymous trolls goaded Bryk to kill herself. “DO IT, if you’re such a weak willed thin skinned dips— then f— do it,” wrote one heckler. Eventually, she did. Bryk’s death was a cruel blow for America’s transgender community, coming just as public awareness of the issue is peaking. Similar suicides — such as that of Ohio teen Leelah Alcorn —  have drawn huge outpourings of support for victims. Bruce Jenner’s revelation on Friday that he is transitioning to become a woman, meanwhile, has been hailed as a watershed moment in awareness about the transgender community. But Bryk’s suicide suggests that celebrity interviews are no panacea for the pain felt by transgender individuals across the country, and that progress continues to be slow. It also once again raises questions about the misogynist online gaming culture that reared its ugly head during last year’s Gamergate controversy. “Next time you think it’s funny to make fun of someone transgender think about who you’re hurting,” wrote Lisa Bryk, Rachel’s mother, on Facebook next to an article about her daughter’s death. Rachel Bryk lived a short and painful life. According to archived tweets, she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia that made everyday tasks excruciating. “For 7 years now,” she wrote shortly before committing suicide. “Only gets worse over time.” “She spent every day in pain,” her mother said. Whether it was her illnesses or her insular nature, Bryk spent hours online playing and developing games. She was particularly devoted to Dolphin, software (called an emulator) that allows people to play Nintendo Wii or GameCube games in high-definition on personal computers. “She often would do a lot of the drudge work that no one else would do and attempt features that no one else had time to work on,” according to a Dolphin community post commemorating Bryk. The shy kid from Wall, N.J., found a community online. Most of the time, Bryk bantered with fellow gamers about Dolphin fixes and glitches. But sometimes, she talked about being transgender. “On the plus side I managed to get through 3 airports without being misgendered, even by people who saw my [male] ID and even got a shocked reaction from someone who saw my name and had not previously suspected,” Bryk wrote in early April. Her Twitter account shows male and female symbols alongside a pronoun guide: “she/her.” But in addition to community, Bryk also found torment on the Internet. At one point, the abuse on 4chan, an anonymous Internet message board, became so bad that she left and started using Reddit instead. “There’s not constant transphobia on reddit any time I post, or someone mentions me, like there is here,” she explained on April 7 after returning to 4chan. In that same post, Bryk sounded suicidal. “The rest of you don’t have to worry though, I’m gonna kill myself soon enough and you won’t have to be bothered by me anymore,” she wrote. Some users begged her not to. “You can’t let some of these mean people affect you,” one person wrote. “If it wasn’t that it’d be something else. That’s just how 4chan is.” Others encouraged her to kill herself, however. “How do you feel about closed casket funerals?” asked one anonymous commenter on April 15. “Jumping off a bridge is not rocket science,” wrote another. “Convincing yourself to do it is hard,” Bryk answered. “Not realizing there would be cops on suicide patrol made it harder too since they scared the heck out of me and I hadn’t previously thought to make sure I didn’t look suspicious.” When someone suggested Bryk would be back online within a few days “thriving on the drama” she had created with her talk of suicide, she replied, “Nah.” True to her word, Bryk killed herself a week later. She was the fourth person to commit suicide off the George Washington Bridge in nine days. Last year, officials announced a plan to put up nine-foot fences along the bridge, but the fences have yet to go up. As during her life, Bryk’s death drew the best and worst out of the Internet. On her mother’s Facebook page, supporters posted messages criticizing those who drove Bryk to suicide. “No one is placed on this earth to judge,” wrote one family friend. “People hide behind their computers and type vicious comments. People are ‘brave’ behind their screens but really, they are ignorant and sad.” Lisa Bryk said her daughter’s illnesses — and not just the abuse she suffered online — drove her to suicide. “While Rachel was certainly bullied and harassed online, that was NOT the reason she committed suicide,” she wrote. “Please pass along info on the abuse that trans individuals endure, but let’s also educate people on how difficult it is to live every moment in pain. A combination of everything was likely the cause, so let’s not make her a anonymous statistic.” But commenters on 4chan wasted no time in doing precisely that. “So on the post mortem will they refer to [Bryk] as ‘it’ ‘she’ or ‘he’?” one asked. In a misspelled message of hate, another 4chan user wrote: “good riddens.” Correction: The original version of this story misdescribed Dolphin software. It enables users to play Nintendo Wii or GameCube games on personal computers, not the Internet. Also, the Ohio teenage who committed suicide was Leelah Alcorn, not Abby Jones.	138	"[{""start"": 5833, ""end"": 5895, ""text"": ""Also, the Ohio teenage who committed suicide was Leelah Alcorn"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	148	2023-03-20T23:15:04.829612Z	2023-03-20T23:15:04.829726Z	488.537
All Fairfax County middle school and high school teachers have completed an innovative training program to help staffers identify teens in distress this year, part of a response to a series of student suicides across one of the nation’s largest school systems in 2014. More than 9,000 Fairfax teachers have taken part in the online Kognito course this school year as part of an expanding effort among administrators and county officials to address student mental health. The efforts come after the county has grappled, all too frequently, with teen suicides in recent years. In February 2014, two Langley High School students died from suicide within a day of each other. Weeks later, two students at Woodson High School committed suicide within 48 hours. The two deaths at Woodson were among six at the school in three years. Beginning in late September, three teenage girls at three Fairfax schools died in suicides within a month. In November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opened an investigation into suicide clusters in the Virginia county. Last year, the county turned to the virtual Kognito suicide prevention program to address rising concern among Fairfax administrators about teens and depression. Mary Ann Panarelli, the director of intervention and prevention services, said that the Kognito program was seen as a success, and the school system is expanding the training program to all elementary school teachers and offering a modified version for teen students. “In Fairfax, we had sort of a tipping point in the community with the number of suicides,” said Laura Yager, head of partnerships and resource development with the Fairfax-Falls Church Community Services Board. “It put suicide at the forefront of people’s thinking. While it’s something we pay attention to every day, I think it just heightens people’s desires to learn more and to learn what to look out for.” The Kognito training program allows teachers to take part in virtual conversations with teenage avatars showing signs of psychological stress. The hour-long simulation lets teachers practice having conversations with the digital teens to learn how to effectively communicate with students in crisis. Yager said the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommends Kognito as a resource. The program costs the county about $100,000 per year, paid this year with a state grant. Kognito chief executive Ron Goldman said that the key to the program is the immersive environment that resembles a video game. Earlier iterations of similar programs were not as effective, Goldman said, because they did not engage users. “It was like trying to teach you to ride a bike by having you watch a movie about riding a bike,” Goldman said. Kognito will “transform the way they approach a conversation in real life, like identifying signs of a student showing emotional distress.” Other versions of the Kognito program have been used by the Department of Veterans Affairs for helping soldiers and their families handle post-traumatic stress disorder. Yager said the investment in Kognito represents the community’s interest in helping teens in moments of despair. “I think the community desire to learn more about how to intervene on a topic that can be scary became the reason there was strong interest,” Yager said. The program’s strategies already have been put to use. Fairfax County officials said a county teacher used his newfound skills to notice one student who appeared to be in distress. He then escorted the student to the counselor’s office to get her help.	137	"[{""start"": 471, ""end"": 574, ""text"": ""The efforts come after the county has grappled, all too frequently, with teen suicides in recent years."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 575, ""end"": 932, ""text"": ""In February 2014, two Langley High School students died from suicide within a day of each other.

In a heart-wrenching letter posted to Tumblr on Dec. 28, Leelah Alcorn — the 17-year-old transgender girl who apparently committed suicide after a long battle with her parents over her gender identity — wrote that she hoped readers would hear what happened to her and try to “fix society.” But as the note began circulating more widely this week, the Internet’s self-appointed vigilantes have turned themselves to a less ambitious quest: “fixing” Alcorn’s mother, Carla, and her father, Doug. Carla was, per Alcorn’s Tumblr note, the primary antagonist in her battle to gender-transition; when Leelah, born Josh, told her mother she was transgender, Carla “reacted extremely negatively, telling me it was a phase,” Leelah wrote. That is not, needless to say, the reaction endorsed by LGBT advocates or family psychotherapists. So in revenge, Leelah’s supporters dug up Carla’s Facebook page and flooded her with messages about Leelah’s death. “You’re disgusting.” “You awful b—-.” “Your daughter killed herself because of you.” “The entire Internet … can see what you have done.” “I hope you read her suicide letter and cried your heart out,” one person wrote. “But you probably didn’t. You don’t seem to be able to care for others in a way a normal and healthy human being does.” Vigilantes also posted the phone numbers of both Alcorn’s mother and father. On Tumblr, one user urged her followers to call Carla’s employer, a relatively new tactic in the online-shaming game. “Honestly?” tweeted one user who posted Doug’s phone number. “I’m ok [with] terrorizing Leelah’s parents for eternity.” The sentiment is understandable, in some ways. As my colleague Terrence McCoy wrote this morning, Leelah was a smart, witty, self-aware girl, a caricaturist at an Ohio amusement park and a junior in high school. The pain and isolation she describes is heartbreaking. And the issues of transgender suicide and acceptance, which Leelah writes about in some detail, are huge, real, urgent subjects that require our action. But if you think the best, most effective possible action you can take to advance transgender rights is to harass the grieving mother of a recently deceased child, you lack imagination, humanity, any experience with grief, or some combination of the three. Whatever else Alcorn’s parents may be — or appear to be, on the basis of a couple Tumblr posts — they are also grieving parents who just lost a bright, articulate child in one of the most soul-rending ways possible. What, exactly, do you know about it? “We’re presented these people as one-dimensional avatars of views we’re meant to either endorse or repudiate,” wrote Flavorwire’s Tom Hawking in a thoughtful essay on vigilantism earlier this week. “They’re not so much people as they are symbols, faces to be published with a topical caption in all-caps Impact.” Except, he points out, they are of course people. People we don’t know at all. “Doxing” has become a trendy tool in the online activist’s workbench this year; in some unsettling conflation of old-school flame-war trolling and legitimate protest, advocates for justified, worthwhile causes — like transgender rights — have resorted to personal attacks and petty vengeances, often in negligence of real issues and to the detriment of innocent people. In the past year, the Internet has — in the name of truth, justice or some other moral high-ground — doxed feminists, anti-feminists, Facebook racists, rape victims, gay school teachers, tasteless self-portraitists, Jenna Jameson’s former personal assistant and police officers unrelated to the shooting of Michael Brown. Just last month, the self-explanatory (and wildly controversial) Tumblr called “Racists Getting Fired” claimed several careers and many, many more followers — resonating in large part because of the idea that it only “doxed for good.” This isn’t the nasty, ethically unsound mischief of old, its followers argued. This is justified. This is activism. The problems with this philosophy, of course, are manifold. For one thing, as the ethicist Shannon Vallor points out, doxing often intentionally exposes people to harm — which, news flash, is bad on its face. Then there’s the inevitable collateral damage: innocent friends or relatives or coworkers of the victim, who are suddenly afraid someone’s going to show up at their house. (The Alcorns, for instance, have three children besides Leelah. And “Racists Getting Fired” ended, abruptly, when it doxed a woman who had been framed.) And once an Internet mob is unleashed, there’s no telling how wild, how disproportionately or undeservedly terrible, its ravings will become. The whole process is brutal, and blunt, and blind — it requires reducing your opponent to a caricature and throwing little darts at it. Little darts may comfort, of course. But I doubt it’s the kind of social “fix” that Leelah Alcorn was looking for.	136	"[{""start"": 73, ""end"": 287, ""text"": ""he 17-year-old transgender girl who apparently committed suicide after a long battle with her parents over her gender identity — wrote that she hoped readers would hear what happened to her and try to “fix society"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1643, ""end"": 1807, ""text"": ""As my colleague Terrence McCoy wrote this morning, Leelah was a smart, witty, self-aware girl, a caricaturist at an Ohio amusement park and a junior in high school."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1808, ""end"": 2014, ""text"": ""The pain and isolation she describes is heartbreaking.

Suicides, for the most part, remain in the shadows. Unless the dead person was famous or the death occurred in a public place, the suicide is seldom noted. Friends and relatives don’t necessarily want to talk about it, even though suicide is the third-leading cause of death among American teens. Let a kid be killed for the shoes on his feet or die while texting and driving, and there are rallies and reports, soul-searching and studies. But suicide? Shh. In Fairfax County, where two of the Washington area’s top high schools have each had two boys kill themselves in a span of 48 hours this year, families, kids and schools are beginning to talk. Schools are holding assemblies and seminars. Parents are urging mental health screenings. One school is even trying milk-and-cookie breaks to soothe frazzled teens. “We absolutely have a responsibility to examine this as closely as possible to understand why this has continued to happen in one particular high school at this rate,” Fairfax County School Board member Megan McLaughlin — whose Braddock District includes W.T. Woodson High School and whose two sons attend the school — told The Washington Post’s Justin Jouvenal and T. Rees Shapiro. “It’s simply too high.” Woodson has had six suicides — all boys — in the past three years. At George Washington University, two male freshmen and a female senior killed themselves this year. Langley High School had two suicides back to back in February, and they devastated students. Families held an impromptu gathering at McLean Bible Church the night after the second suicide, where kids, moms and dads hugged and cried. “We have to pull ourselves out of this pit now,” said one of the students who went on the stage and took the microphone. He was among a group of boys who openly talked about pain, love, anger and fear in a huge auditorium of people. They were showing other boys how to talk, to feel and to survive. Most of the kids understood exactly how the boys who took their lives felt. “Stress, there’s just so much stress,” one sophomore told me. The suicide rate for Virginia is on the low side when you look at the rest of the country. That’s little comfort to the kids and families at these schools. There, the numbers are extremely high, and the students are devastated. The county must also contend with the huge number of students who consider or attempt suicide. In a 2011 Fairfax County youth survey, 19.6 percent of girls said they considered suicide, and 4.7 percent said they attempted it. Nearly 12 percent of boys said they have considered suicide, and almost 3 percent said they tried unsuccessfully. But in the past decade, boys have steadily been more successful than girls at killing themselves, at a 4 to 1 rate, nationally. Boys don’t always talk about their feelings. No surprise there. None of the families or friends who talked to The Post about the high school suicides said they saw them coming. The boys in those Northern Virginia high schools were, for the most part, pretty successful in sports, school and their social circles. It was heartbreaking to read some of the boys’ tweets and Facebook posts, in which they posed with cars and girls, smiling and laughing, giving no indication of the dark clouds gathering inside their heads. It’s a complex problem, with mental health issues, hormones, and social and academic pressures that make survival of the teen years almost a miracle. I know very few folks who look back fondly on those years. Teen suicide wasn’t as prevalent in the 1950s. Most suicides then were by adults. But after the ’50s, the rates spiked and kept climbing, tripling by 1990. Meanwhile, adult suicide dropped, according to an analysis, Explaining the Rise in Youth Suicide, written in 2001 by David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser and Karen E. Norberg. What has changed in our society that leads so many teens to believe they can’t go on? Maybe we have painted futures so bright they have blinded these maxed-out children. Jack Chen, the Fairfax Station 15-year-old who stepped in front of a commuter train on Feb. 26 to end his life, said he wanted to be a professor and have four kids. But that brilliant future seemed exhausting to him in the note he left behind. “There is too much stress in my life from school and the environment it creates, expectations for sports, expectations from my friends and expectations from my family,” Jack wrote. The people in the Northern Virginia high schools talk about the crushing stress kids are under, loading up on advanced classes, winning at sports, piling on extracurricular activities. Teens at the region’s best high schools said they get only four to five hours of sleep every night. Meanwhile, Ivy League universities trumpet their rejection rates. Stop and really listen to the teens in our gold-plated Zip codes. Some of them are miserable. And why boys? We don’t want our boys to talk about their feelings, to look weak. Maybe that’s why so few admit to thinking about suicide yet so many do it. About 4,600 people between the ages of 10 and 24 kill themselves annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2010, 1,386 between the ages of 13 and 18 killed themselves. It’s time to talk about that and time to let boys grab a microphone and tell everyone how they feel. And most important, adults need to listen to them.

A decision by a Florida sheriff to arrest two girls, ages 12 and 14, on felony charges for bullying a classmate until she committed suicide has divided experts and reverberated far beyond the town where the tragic events unfolded. Some experts said the arrests were a just response and will help draw attention to the problem of online bullying, a growing dynamic among the nation’s youth as more of them spend time on mobile gadgets. Others questioned the use of criminal charges and argued that the arrests will only prolong the pain in this case. Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, jumped to her death from the top of a silo at a derelict cement plant last month. On Monday, the Polk County sheriff’s department arrested two of her classmates, charging them with aggravated stalking, a third-degree felony. According to affidavits filed in the case, the girls’ actions were “a contributing factor” in Sedwick’s suicide. They urged Sedwick to kill herself, authorities said. The 12-year-old, at the behest of the 14-year-old, beat her. After Sedwick’s death, the older girl posted on her Facebook page: “Yes ik [I know] I bullied Rebecca nd she killed her self but IDGAF [I don’t give a (expletive)],” according to news reports. Under Florida law, the name of anyone charged with a felony is public record. Following standard operating procedure, the sheriff’s office released the names of the arrestees as well as their mug shots. The Washington Post typically does not identify juveniles charged with a crime. “People need to know who felons are in the community, whether they’re adults or children,” said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd at a news conference Tuesday, in which he urged parents to be aware of their children’s behavior. Sue Scheff, who runs Parent’s Universal Resource Experts, a resource group for parents with troubled youth, commended Judd. “Hats off to the sheriff,” she said. “I think it’s great. I think parents need to wake up and be shaken up a little bit.” Other experts said that arresting the two girls might convey the opposite message. “The decision to charge them almost seems to take responsibility away from the adults,” said Nadine Connell, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Dallas. She said adolescents are too immature to understand the consequences of bullying, but that parents and school officials had an obligation to intervene earlier. Juveniles have been charged in bullying cases before. In 2010, five were charged after the suicide of Phoebe Prince, a Massachusetts high school student. Their names were also made public. Yet for a defendant as young as 12 to be charged with a felony for bullying surprised experts, despite the extreme and sustained nature of the abuse Sedwick received. “I think this is uncharted territory,” said Justin Patchin, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Patchin also questioned Judd’s decision. “He wants to make a statement, He wants to let them know: ‘If you do this, I’m going to come after you.’ I just don’t know if it’s going to work.” Judd told reporters that the older defendant was dating a boy who had previously been seeing Sedwick, and this previous relationship apparently made the 14-year-old uncomfortable. So she began bullying Sedwick and Sedwick’s friends last winter. Witnesses told detectives they heard the 14-year-old tell Sedwick she should “drink bleach and die.” Sedwick’s peers soon ostracized her as a result of the older girl’s influence, according to the affidavits. The younger arrestee, once a friend of Sedwick, turned on her and instigated a fight with Sedwick at their school in February, according to the documents. Witnesses told investigators that Sedwick did not fight back. Sedwick became increasingly desperate. As Judd recounted, she tried to run away from home and she received treatment after her mother found cuts on her wrists. After the fight, her mother removed her from the school. She had started at a new school this year, but she continued to receive abusive messages on her phone, the sheriff said. While the 14-year-old is being held in custody, the judge sent the younger girl home because of her remorse and her family’s cooperation with the investigation. The department continues to gather evidence and other charges are still possible. Investigators are seeking records from Ask.fm and Kik, the social networks that the girls used to communicate. Because the companies are based abroad, the legal process for obtaining those records will be more complicated, the sheriff said. Scheff, the parental advocate, argued that the defendants were not too young to take responsibility for their alleged actions. “If they were old enough to be on social media sites, or mature enough to be using the language that they were using . . . they should be held accountable,” she said. But Connell, the criminologist, said that by releasing the girls’ names and charging them with felonies, the sheriff might only make it more difficult for them to put their past behind them and become productive adults. “You’ve lost three girls instead of just one,” she said.

Ever since 1998, Monica Lewinsky has been trying to escape her reputation as America’s most notorious White House intern. She tried co-authoring a book in 1999 with Andrew Morton. She designed a line of hideous purses. She had a reality show. Now, in a piece for Vanity Fair, out Thursday, she writes, “I’ve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past.” Apparently, taking back her narrative means presenting herself as a victim, as Lewinsky has chosen to conflate her social ostracism and subsequent depression with the fate of Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers freshman who committed suicide in 2010 after his roommate used a webcam to record what Clementi believed was a private tryst in his dorm room. Clementi was gay. The roommate, Dharun Ravi, set up his laptop in their shared dorm room, then watched from another laptop belonging to his hallmate. Ravi also told his Twitter followers to watch a second broadcast, which never took place. From Vanity Fair’s description of her article: When Tyler Clementi, the 18-year-old Rutgers freshman who was secretly streamed via Webcam kissing another man, committed suicide in September 2010, Lewinsky writes, she was brought to tears, but her mother was especially distraught: “She was reliving 1998, when she wouldn’t let me out of her sight. She was replaying those weeks when she stayed by my bed, night after night, because I, too, was suicidal. The shame, the scorn, and the fear that had been thrown at her daughter left her afraid that I would take my own life—a fear that I would be literally humiliated to death.” Lewinsky clarifies that she has never actually attempted suicide, but had strong suicidal temptations several times during the investigations and during one or two periods after. Lewinsky writes that following Clementi’s tragedy “my own suffering took on a different meaning. Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?” She also says that, when news of her affair with Clinton broke in 1998, not only was she arguably the most humiliated person in the world, but, “thanks to the Drudge Report, I was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the Internet.” Her current goal, she says, “is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.” Clementi’s death sparked a nationwide outcry against bullying and anti-gay harassment. Dan Savage’s “It Gets Better Project,” created after the suicide of Billy Lucas, was thrust into the national spotlight by Clementi’s death. “It Gets Better” aimed to deter other gay teens and young adults from committing suicide when they felt hopeless about their situations. Clementi committed suicide Sept. 22, 2010, just one day after Savage and his husband, Terry Miller, uploaded their video to YouTube. It seems an especially curious choice for Lewinsky to wrap herself in Clementi’s tragedy. Clementi’s humiliation stemmed, in part, from an immutable characteristic: He was gay, and he was targeted because of it. Lewinsky, on the other hand, accepts responsibility for her part in a presidential affair; she wrote that it was consensual. Whatever her intention, the appearance is that she took the tragic death of a victim of anti-gay harassment and made it all about her. This is a concerted effort. She holds a master’s degree in social psychology, an area of psychology that largely concerns itself with discovering what drives what people think about others. Lewinsky, in the photo accompanying the Vanity Fair piece, is depicted as a chaste, modern-day Snow White. She lounges on a crimson sofa, in a room that appears to be a library, barefoot and clad in a demure white dress that would fit in well at a Washington society fête. A bow at the waist adds a note of child-like innocence. Her face, framed by raven locks, bears minimal makeup, and her jewelry is understated. Even the choice of media outlet is deliberate: Vanity Fair presents itself as a serious publication that publishes smart pieces about celebrities accompanied by artful photographs and enviable styling. It’s above-the-fray in a way that People or Us Weekly are not: You can read it in public while escaping judgment. It’s unclear if Lewinsky wants to be famous, or if she just doesn’t want to be the first choice in a word association game about presidential emissions. As narrative-shaping goes, there are better examples. Lewinsky, 40, might do well to take a page from the woman known as the country’s Most Famous Man-Stealing Sorceress: Angelina Jolie. Ever since the romance that began with “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have executed some masterful narrative steering, due in no small part to the fact that they make it look completely natural. In fact, they’re doing a new movie together. Says Anne Helen Petersen on Celebrity Gossip, Academic Style: Please recall: Angelina Jolie, whose image had theretofore been characterized by brother-kissing, amulet-wearing, and associations with the likes of Billy Bob Thorton, “steals” Brad Pitt from all-American Jennifer Aniston.  They don’t get married.  They adopt many, many non-white children; they have three children out of wedlock.  And they got away with it!  Not only that, they are beloved.  Indeed, they are, without a doubt, the biggest stars in America.  Their auras are the largest; they may not be able to open a film like, say, oh, John Travolta in Wild Hogs, but trust me, their brands are much, much more valuable. Should Lewinsky adopt her own United Colors of Benetton ad? Probably not. Jolie and Pitt have that tactic sewn up. But they never publicly acknowledge there’s a narrative to change. There are no declarations, only action. As Don Draper would advise, “If you don’t like what’s being said, change the conversation.”	133	"[{""start"": 1063, ""end"": 1210, ""text"": ""When Tyler Clementi, the 18-year-old Rutgers freshman who was secretly streamed via Webcam kissing another man, committed suicide in September 2010"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2538, ""end"": 2624, ""text"": ""Clementi’s death sparked a nationwide outcry against bullying and anti-gay harassment."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2538, ""end"": 2624, ""text"": ""Clementi’s death sparked a nationwide outcry against bullying and anti-gay harassment."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2903, ""end"": 3035, ""text"": ""Clementi committed suicide Sept. 22, 2010, just one day after Savage and his husband, Terry Miller, uploaded their video to YouTube."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	143	2023-03-20T13:06:28.511081Z	2023-03-20T13:06:28.511225Z	496.384
ORLANDO, Fla. — Charges have been dropped against two girls whom a sheriff had accused of bullying a Florida classmate who later committed suicide. Last month, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd announced the arrest of a 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old girl as juveniles on stalking charges. He said then that the two were primarily responsible for bullying Rebecca Sedwick, a 12-year-old who jumped to her death at an abandoned concrete plant in September. Lawyer Jose Baez held a news conference Wednesday to announce that the charge had been dropped against his 12-year-old client. The attorney for the 14-year-old, Ronald Toward, said the Polk State Attorney’s office also had dropped the charge against his client. Baez demanded an apology from Judd for arresting the 12-year-old, whom he described as a “troubled young girl” who had been bullied herself. “I found zero evidence having to do with my client that would rise to the level of a criminal act,” Baez said. At a news conference in Winter Haven — just minutes after Baez’s news conference had ended — Judd said he didn’t regret anything he did. Judd said last month that the bullying began about a year ago after the 14-year-old started dating Rebecca’s ex-boyfriend. The older girl threatened to fight Rebecca while they were sixth-graders and told her “to drink bleach and die,” the sheriff had said. She also persuaded the younger girl to bully Rebecca, even though they had been best friends, the sheriff said.	132	"[{""start"": 1231, ""end"": 1365, ""text"": ""The older girl threatened to fight Rebecca while they were sixth-graders and told her “to drink bleach and die,” the sheriff had said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 148, ""end"": 455, ""text"": ""Last month, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd announced the arrest of a 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old girl as juveniles on stalking charges.

The father of two teen boys who allegedly bullied a Minnesota girl with racist comments on Snapchat has reportedly been fired from his job. The alleged case of cyberbullying became a national news story when the father of the girl made an emotional plea on YouTube, seeking to force his daughter’s bullies to “own” their comments. In the nearly six-minute video, Brad Knudson played a voice-mail message that he said he received from the boys’ father, Deron Puro. In the message, Puro used a racial slur. According to KMSP, Puro’s employer confirmed that as of Jan. 21, he was no longer associated with the financial firm, where he worked as an independent contractor. Knudson’s video has been seen more than 1.3 million times since it was posted Monday. In it, he explained that he and his wife adopted their African American daughter, Dierdra, 11 years ago. On New Year’s Eve, while she and a friend were sending snaps to friends at their house, Dierdra began receiving abusive messages. After the third abusive snap, Dierdra’s friend called and told Knudson and his wife. Knudson recorded what he said was the fourth snap from the teen boys, who are twins, and played it on his YouTube video. “You’re a s—,” one teen said, adding the n-word. “You’s a fat a– b—-, yes you are,” the other brother added. “As you can imagine, my wife and I were extremely shocked,” Knudson said in the video. Later, he said in the video, he tried to reach the children’s parents; he said they did not respond to his calls. Finally, he went to the police. [Is online harassment a permanent part of the Internet’s future?] In the video, Knudson said that after police spoke to the children at school, he communicated by phone with Puro, who denied that his children had done anything wrong. Puro called again later and left a message, according to Knudson, who played the message in the video. “Yeah, Brad, tides have turned, huh. I guess you’re a [n-word] lover,” the voice-mail message said. Taking his complaint to YouTube was a last resort, he said. “It just dawned on me that I can’t have this hanging over us on my daughter thinking the worst and something could happen,” Knudson said in the video. “I just want him to own it … and his twins that go to high school as a freshman, they can own it, too.” [A Deadly Web of Deceit: A social media hoax leads to a teen girl’s suicide] “I just had to get this off my chest.

First and foremost, we do not tolerate racism, harassment or bullying of any kind,” Kristi Mussman, the district’s director of communications, said in a statement, according to KMSP. “We are conducting our own investigation to get a better understanding of the events that led up to this video.

TAMPA — For nearly a year, as many as 15 girls ganged up on 12-year-old Rebecca Ann Sedwick and picked on her, authorities say, bombarding her with online messages such as “You should die” and “Why don’t you go kill yourself.” Rebecca couldn’t take it anymore. She changed one of her online screen names to “That Dead Girl.” She messaged a boy in North Carolina: “I’m jumping.” And then, on Monday, the girl from Lakeland, Fla., went to an abandoned concrete plant, climbed a tower and hurled herself to her death. Authorities have seized computers and cellphones from some of the girls as they decide whether to bring charges in what appeared to be the nation’s latest deadly cyberbullying case. The bullying started over a “boyfriend issue” last year at Crystal Lake Middle School, Sheriff Grady Judd said. Police said Rebecca was suspended at one point for fighting with a girl who used to be her friend. Rebecca had been “absolutely terrorized” by the other girls, Judd said. He said detectives found some of her diaries at her home, and she wrote about how depressed she was about the situation. The case has illustrated, once more, the ways in which young people are using the Internet to torment others. In December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because of what she described as bullying, the sheriff said. Later, her mother, Tricia Norman, began home-schooling her in Lakeland, a city of about 100,000 midway between Tampa and Orlando, Judd said. This fall, Rebecca started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, Judd said. But the bullying continued online. — Associated Press	130	"[{""start"": 8, ""end"": 513, ""text"": ""For nearly a year, as many as 15 girls ganged up on 12-year-old Rebecca Ann Sedwick and picked on her, authorities say, bombarding her with online messages such as “You should die” and “Why don’t you go kill yourself.” Rebecca couldn’t take it anymore.

“I’m Stella Ann. I’m 18, from Minnesota,” the brunette says into the camera. She wears a beige blouse and speaks in the flat tones of the Midwest. “I want to be a major in biology, minor in chemistry, and I want to be an anesthesiologist,” she adds. She’s speaking of her real life. But this wasn’t that reality. It was an amateur porn video, posted on a Web site called CastingCouch–X. And her name wasn’t Stella Ann. It was Alyssa Funke. She was a native of Stillwater, Minn., and a straight-A biology student at the University of Wisconsin at River Falls. Days after the video was posted in March, derisive messages started to flood her Twitter and Facebook accounts. According to a KMSP-TV report this week, they were mostly from Stillwater High School, which she had attended the year before. “Wow your a thot,” wrote one, using the slang for prostitute. “Does her dad know?” “Nothing brings a school together like a porn star who graduated last year,” another wrote. Funke was defiant at first. She grew up in a tough home, and had seen trouble before. According to Arizona state prison records, her father, Rashad Bowman, was convicted in 2001 of fraudulent schemes in Maricopa County Court in Arizona. His ongoing incarceration split up the family, and court records describe how she and her father tried to communicate with one another with audio tapes. Since then, Funke has struggled with money and depression, KMSP-TV reports. “The people that envy & hate you the most, stalk you on social media the most,” she wrote on Facebook after her porn video was posted. But on Twitter, she affected a different tone. Her tweets vacillated between teen vulnerability — “Clingy, attached, and horny is what describes me i think” — and outright anger. “It’s called Karma and it’s pronounced “haha, f— you!” On April 14, she tweeted: “Pornstar status.” And: “FAMOUS for dayzzzzzzz.” According to her family, however, her classmates’ taunts wounded her deeply. Later in April, two days after her final tweet, she got ahold of a shotgun and killed herself on her family’s boat, according to KMSP-TV.  Details are sparse. Her family did not return phone calls from The Washington Post. But at 2 p.m. that day, the University of Wisconsin called her hometown police department to request help checking on the teenager. At 2:30 p.m., the Pioneer Press reports, county deputies found her not far from Big Carnelian Lake near May Township, a small town of about 3,000 outside Minneapolis. Weeks later, her family, who declined to be interviewed on camera, told KMSP-TV they suspected the taunts had played a significant role in Funke’s suicide. They launched “The Alyssa Stop Bullying Fund,” which, sadly, only raised $165. They offered this description of the fund: On Wednesday April 16,  at the young age of 19 Alyssa Funke took her own life. Alyssa like so many other teens was a victim of bully and sadly the bullying lead to her death. Social media has revolutionized the way people bully each other now days.  Now you can say whatever you want and not have to look the person in the face while doing it.  This needs to stop! Bullying has cost thousands of young lives every year and we need to do something about it! Professionals, psychiatrists and psychologists, often point out that suicide is rarely the result of a single event but rather an accumulation of troubles. But students at River Falls likewise believe the messages sent to Funke contributed to her suicide. “A lot of people are really negative — troll-y — about it or standing up and saying it shouldn’t happen to people,” one friend told KMSP-TV. “Sad it’s still happening, actually.” Funke’s video, according to KMSP-TV, has not been removed from Casting Couch’s Web site, and the company didn’t return its requests for comment. The local sheriff’s office doesn’t think the messages sent to Funke constitute criminal harassment, and the investigation is ongoing.

The first time Abby Jones talked to Leelah Alcorn, it was summer, when Alcorn had just taken a new job as a caricaturist at an Ohio amusement park. That day, Jones didn’t notice the sadness. She didn’t see the confusion — or the pain that she would come to recognize in Alcorn’s pale brown eyes. Alcorn was demure, but witty, someone who would surprise with a quiet joke that left you rolling. “She had this light,” Jones told The Washington Post. “She would make these jokes, and say these things quietly that were really funny. Basically, we were soon best friends.” The last time Abby Jones talked to Leelah Alcorn was on Christmas morning. Jones again didn’t notice anything amiss. By then, she knew of the struggles Alcorn endured. She knew that Alcorn’s given name was Joshua, and that she was transgender. She knew Alcorn’s parents resisted their child’s urge to transition. And she knew all about Leelah’s depression. But as the two talked last week, Alcorn seemed upbeat. Happy, even. “She was talking about her New Year’s resolutions, and how she was going to try to be more happy and accept people for who they were,” Jones told The Post early Wednesday morning. “It was a really light-hearted conversation. And then on Sunday, when I heard what happened, I was just in shock.” Her friend, 17, was dead. That morning, around 2:30 a.m., Alcorn walked four miles from her middle-class home in King Mills to the nearby Interstate 71. There, according to local media reports, she was struck by a Freightliner semi truck. The driver has not been charged, and local authorities continue to investigate. But Jones said she knows what happened: Her friend committed suicide. Support for that conclusion was etched all over Alcorn’s Tumblr page. The transgender teen posted an impassioned “suicide note” on that page that has now attracted worldwide attention, spawning a trending hashtag #LeelahAlcorn. Transgender advocates have seized upon her words as a clarion call for transgender rights. “My dear GIRL, baby SISTER #LeelahAlcorn,” one person wrote. “We will make your voice heard. Rest in power, beautiful.” The conversation sparked by her death is exactly what Alcorn said she wanted. She spoke of a terrible suffering: caught between two genders, trapped among adults she said couldn’t possibly understand. “The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,” she wrote in her note, which by early Wednesday morning had attracted tens of thousands of views. “… My death needs to mean something. …  My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say, ‘That’s f—ed up,’ and fix it. Fix society. Please.” Alcorn’s parents have not commented on their child’s post. According to the Cincinnati Enquirer, they have requested privacy. On Sunday, mother Carla Wood Alcorn mourned her child’s death. “My sweet 17-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went to Heaven this morning,” she wrote in a message she later removed. “He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck. Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your prayers.” Friend Abby Jones criticized that message as an example of what contributed to her friend’s depression. “They used the wrong pronouns,” Jones told The Post. “Her mom is there referring to her as her ‘baby boy Joshua.’ She could not be who she wanted to be because of her home life.” That observation is reflected in Alcorn’s posts, which were found shortly after her death. The first was called “suicide note.” And the second was titled, “Sorry.” In that letter, she wrote to a number of family and friends, complimenting them and thanking them for their help. In her note to Abby Jones, she lamented “all I did was make your life harder and I’m sorry.” But she affected a very different tone in her final correspondence with her parents. “Mom and Dad: F–k you. You can’t just control other people like that,” the 17-year-old wrote. “That’s messed up.” She elaborated in her “suicide note,” where she recalled when she realized she was a “girl trapped in a boy’s body.” She said she spent the next 10 years in a state of confusion. “When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. … My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to Christian therapists (who were all very biased), so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.” Then, finally, Alcorn signed her note. “Goodbye,” she said. “(Leelah) Josh Alcorn.”	128	"[{""start"": 1289, ""end"": 1676, ""text"": ""Her friend, 17, was dead.

The final evening of Jack Chen’s life was indistinguishable from many others. The sophomore returned home from school, ate dinner with his mother and retired to his room. His mother asked him to turn out his light at midnight. Inside his bedroom, anguish gnawed at him, a darkness invisible to friends and family: He maintained a 4.3 grade-point average at one of the area’s top high schools, was a captain of the junior varsity football team and had never tried drugs or alcohol. But that hidden pain drove Jack from his Fairfax Station home early the next morning — Wednesday, Feb. 26. The 15-year-old, who pestered his father to quit smoking and wear his safety belt, walked to nearby tracks and stepped between the rails as a commuter train approached. His death is one of six apparent suicides at Fairfax’s W.T. Woodson High School during the past three years, including another student found dead the next day. The toll has left the school community reeling and prompted an urgent question: Why would so many teens from a single suburban school take their lives? County officials say they do not believe the deaths are directly connected, and experts say that suicides among teens occurring in such a short span are extremely rare. Students have cried openly in Woodson’s hallways while teachers have tried to show resilience. Frustrated parents have asked the Woodson leadership and school system administrators for answers while wondering whether the school’s high-pressure, high-achieving culture could be playing a role. “A loss like this cuts a deep wound. It persists. It lingers. It’s very slow to heal,” said Steve Stuban, whose son attended Woodson and committed suicide in 2011. “I have no idea what causes this to occur with increased incidence. All I know is it seems it’s occurring more at Woodson than any other place in the county.” In interviews, parents of five of the six Woodson teens who apparently took their own lives said their search for answers is never-ending. The Washington Post generally does not identify youths suspected of killing themselves, but the families agreed to speak to The Post about their children to illustrate how teen suicide has profoundly affected their lives. Ivy Kilby’s 15-year-old son Cameron committed suicide on Aug. 4, 2012, a month before he was supposed to return to Woodson for his sophomore year. As a mother who has faced the grief that follows the death of a child, she said that parents should talk to their children about suicide and mental health before it’s too late. “I never had a conversation with my kids until that happened to us,” Ivy Kilby said. “I hope every parent has a conversation with their children to ask them how they are doing mentally.” A search for answers Jack Chen spent his final hours writing a note. He loved his family and friends. He had dreams of being a computer science professor and having four children. But at 15, he “couldn’t keep doing this.” “There is too much stress in my life from school and the environment it creates, expectations for sports, expectations from my friends and expectations from my family,” Jack wrote. He ended with a simple: “Goodbye.” Jack’s death and the loss of five other students have reverberated within the community; more than 1,000 Woodson parents, teachers and administrators flooded into the school’s auditorium on a recent night trying to make sense of it all. The suicides have been especially baffling because many of the teens did not seem to exhibit the factors that would put them at risk. They had good grades, stable families and excelled at sports. Fairfax County School Board member Megan McLaughlin, whose Braddock district includes Woodson and whose two sons attend the school, said talking about teen suicide is no longer taboo, and the school has moved quickly to talk to students about depression and self-harm. “We absolutely have a responsibility to examine this as closely as possible to understand why this has continued to happen in one particular high school at this rate,” McLaughlin said. “It’s simply too high.” Many wonder if there is a common thread. A number of parents and students said they worry about the fierce competition for limited spots in the state’s prestigious public university system. Though teen suicide has dropped since its peak in the 1980s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fairfax saw 10 youths die by their own hands in 2013, a five-year high. At Woodson, it is an unavoidable subject. Karen Garza, Fairfax County’s public schools superintendent, said that she encourages students, teachers and parents to talk to one another if they need help. On May 17, the school system plans to host a countywide event that will focus on mental health. “We are all profoundly saddened by the untimely deaths of our students, and our thoughts remain with the families and friends impacted by these losses,” Garza said. Two suicides at Woodson in 48 hours marked the second time this year that has happened at a Fairfax County school. County officials said two Langley High School students committed suicide in January within a day of each other, though investigators also said those deaths appear unrelated. The Langley suicides deeply affected the close community in McLean, and the recent losses at Woodson stoked old memories among the student body. In January 2011, 15-year-old Nick Stuban, a sophomore and rising star on the Woodson Cavaliers football team, committed suicide after he became mired in school discipline hearings for buying synthetic marijuana. “There are many things that play into an individual’s decision to take their own life, and trying to grasp at understanding that is very difficult,” said his father, Steve Stuban. “You’re left with the why, the why did this occur, and a sense of guilt of ‘what could I have done?’ ” Cameron Kilby, a Boy Scout, acolyte at his church and sophomore cross-country runner at Woodson, took his life in the late summer of 2012. A few months later, senior football player Bryan Glenn disappeared one day in October. He planned to attend the upcoming homecoming dance and had ambitions of serving in the military as a helicopter pilot. He was found dead a week later in a Fairfax park a mile and half from Woodson. Then in April, 17-year-old junior Ethan Griffith jumped off a parking garage at the Annandale campus of Northern Virginia Community College. Each of those tragedies was reawakened when the public address system at Woodson crackled to life during sixth period on the day Jack Chen died. Senior Killian Rodgers said he and his classmates froze. They sensed the announcement that was coming, after so many other deaths. “The color just drained out of their faces,” Rodgers said. There was little respite. Students were notified two days later of the junior who took his life after Jack. Many were attending a region semifinal basketball game in Woodson’s gym. The news rippled through the crowd as students checked their phones. “Slowly, people just kept breaking down,” said Bailey Bishop, a senior. Sydni Weissgold, 16, a sophomore, said students and teachers have been reaching out to one another — little acts of reassurance to get through this difficult time and to weave a safety net for any other vulnerable students. Weissgold said friends are sending texts saying “I love you.” She was approached recently by a boy from her history class she rarely spoke with. He gave her a thumbs up and asked whether she was all right. “It’s hard to make sense of it all,” Weissgold said. “You try to stay strong and stay together.” A knock at the door Jim Chen is at a loss. When he runs through the events of the days and weeks leading to his son’s death, he finds nothing amiss. No clue to what he overlooked. There were no signs of depression. No outbursts. No withdrawal. Jack had maintained all A’s, except for a single B-plus in a math class. He rowed on the crew team and was a hurdler on the track team. The father and son had made plans to practice driving. Then, on that chilly February morning, there was a knock at the door. Jack was dead, a police officer told his parents. “I said, ‘This is impossible,’ ” Chen recalled. “ ‘He was a happy boy.’ ” Jim Chen speculates that Jack’s skin medication, which can cause depression, might have played a role. “There was something going on in his mind, but he didn’t give me any chance to do anything,” Chen said. “My heart is aching.” That same anguish has gripped five other Woodson families. Rosella Glenn, Bryan Glenn’s mother, said Woodson doesn’t have the tools to help students with mental health issues. “How many more need to die before somebody wakes up and realizes there is a situation that warrants bringing in more resources to fight this problem?” Glenn said. “I’m tired of seeing flowers and signs around Woodson.” The Glenns said that in the weeks before their son died, he was “at the high point” of his life. There was no explanation for his death, the Glenns said, and they find his suicide hard to accept. “People need to ask more questions about why this is happening,” Rosella Glenn said. “It could be their kids next.” Gayle Griffith lost her husband, Matthew, in 2011, when he died of a heart attack. Less than two years later, her son Ethan committed suicide. The warning signs didn’t appear obvious at first, Griffith said. A straight-A student and Woodson track athlete, Ethan’s slipping grades appeared to be fallout from his father’s death. He was known to help his friends work through math homework assignments in the cafeteria during lunch, and he wore outlandish costumes during spirit days at the school. “He tried to be friends with everyone,” Griffith said. Ethan attended a suicide prevention seminar at Woodson last April, Griffith said, where he heard a nationally renowned speaker, Jordan Burnham, speak to teens about how he had leaped off a building and survived. Burnham uses his own cautionary tale to promote mental health awareness. Days later, Ethan climbed to the top of a parking garage in Annandale and jumped to his death. Griffith had been trying to get her son professional help. The Monday before he died, she arranged for a Woodson psychologist to evaluate him, but the meeting was canceled at the last minute for an emergency, Griffith said. That meeting was rescheduled for Wednesday; Ethan killed himself that Tuesday night. In January, nine months later, Griffith was rummaging through her son’s closet and opened up his backpack. Inside, she found a paper Ethan had written for an Advanced Placement class a few months before he died. He had written that he felt depressed and had suicidal thoughts. “The teacher didn’t follow their protocol,” Griffith said. “If a kid says he’s thought about it or writes about it in a paper, they are supposed to call their team of counselors. But that never happened.” Griffith said she hopes that her son’s writings can serve as a tool to help teachers identify warning signs in students’ work. The county’s assistant superintendent for special services, Kim Dockery, who met with Griffith, declined to comment on Ethan’s case but said the administration is planning to have all county teachers review their training for detecting the signs of suicide. Other families believe the school is doing the best it can. Cameron Kilby’s parents credit Woodson Principal Jeff Yost and other school officials for their efforts to promote suicide awareness. “It’s an extremely hard issue,” Jim Kilby said. “For folks who aren’t affected by it, the tendency is to look for a discrete cause. Having wrestled with this for a while, I don’t think it’s quite so simple.” The Kilbys said that before their son died, teen suicide had never crossed their minds. Now teen mental health is a subject that the Kilbys think about often. “For folks that aren’t connected to suicide, it is a harsh, jolting fact when this happens. It is for us, too, but it’s never too far away from our thoughts,” Jim Kilby said. “We never stop thinking about it.” At Woodson, the latest deaths have revamped efforts in the school community to promote well-being. A student group recently started stress-reducing yoga sessions after class, and other teens have been trained as mental health first responders. In recent years, the administration has moved to restore the number of school psychologists and social workers lost during recession-era budget cuts. Fairfax County high schools have begun posting suicide and depression hotline information on the front pages of their Web sites. School officials said the recent efforts already have had a positive effect: a number of students expressing self-harming feelings have reached out to the school system for help . Yost said that Woodson’s challenges addressing mental health concerns among the student body are not unique. “Every school has this issue,” Yost said. “Every school has to go about fixing it.” Christine Moutier, the chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said the number of suicides at Woodson is high, even if there appears to be nothing linking them. She said such suicide clusters could have very real effects on other students. “The thing we are always concerned about is the phenomenon of suicide contagion,” Moutier said. “Youths are more susceptible to contagion, and research has found that 2 to 5 percent of teen suicides had a possible role of contagion. It is a vast minority, but it doesn’t mean the phenomenon doesn’t exist.” Experts said the problem is particularly acute in the age of social media. Woodson teachers have observed students retweeting and favoriting the final messages from Jack Chen and the junior who died after him, rapidly exposing hundreds of students to the tragedies in an unfiltered way. In a 2011 survey of Fairfax County youths, the most recent data available, approximately 16 percent of Fairfax eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders — a total of 4,840 students — considered suicide. A much smaller percentage of the student population — but more than 1,150 teens — admitted attempting suicide that same year, according to the survey. But the numbers can’t capture the impact of each death. More than 500 people turned out for Jack Chen’s funeral. Friends produced a video showing old family photos of Chen frolicking with his sister, holding a football and playing piano. “He was a great guy with all the smarts and talent to have a bright future,” Jim Chen said. “It’s unbelievable.” Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report..	127	"[{""start"": 757, ""end"": 1068, ""text"": ""His death is one of six apparent suicides at Fairfax’s W.T.

In Palo Alto, Calif., the shrill horn of incoming trains bring a constant reminder of young lives lost too soon. In the past seven years, several teenagers have stepped in front of Caltrains in the Silicon Valley city, where the adolescent suicide rate has soared to five times the national average. It was in this way that a bright, popular, goofy kid named Cameron Lee ended his life in November 2014. By then, his classmates at Henry M. Gunn High School were all too accustomed to this sort of inexplicable tragedy. They hailed, after all, from a part of the country that had become known for its affluence, technical ingenuity and the number of kids that had been pushed to the brink. “I am 15 years old and I just organized a memorial,” Isabelle Blanchard, the sister of one suicide victim, told the Atlantic magazine. It is an eerie refrain that has played out again and again. Over the course of nine months in 2009 and 2010, six Palo Alto teenagers committed suicide. Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 20 children and young adults killed themselves annually in Santa Clara County, where Palo Alto is located. The deaths in the city constitute two recent “suicide clusters” (multiple suicides within a short time frame); there are an average of five in the entire country each year. Having two in the same city in less than a decade is extremely rare. The students died on the tracks, but also by hanging and jumping off a roof or overpass. Each time it happened, their classmates mourned them, and their distraught parents sought answers. In response to what Santa Clara County officials have called an urgent public health problem, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is launching an epidemiological study on teen suicide in the area. A team of suicide prevention specialists is arriving in Santa Clara on Tuesday for a two-week site visit. While these federal teams generally act on infectious-disease outbreaks, the San Jose Mercury News reported, this investigation signals a rare instance of the CDC dispatching a unit for a chronic health issue. In November 2014, the CDC conducted similar research in Fairfax, Va., and found “multiple risk factors,” including high expectations for students, parental pressure on students for success and parental denial of mental health issues among their children. It found that 72 percent of youth suicides exhibited mental health problems. Community members hope that the study will yield responses to the question that has plagued them for the past seven years, when the first suicides began: If these kids had everything they needed to succeed, why were so many choosing to or contemplating giving up on life altogether? In the note that Lee left behind, he wrote that no one was to blame. Not school, not family or friends. He said he felt simply that he had no future in the world, despite his good grades the people who loved him. As the Atlantic’s Hanna Rosin noted in her cover story in December, 74 percent of Gunn students have at least one graduate-degree-holding parent. The high school has been ranked among the nation’s top five in science education. About 20 students get into Stanford University every year. At the same time, when Rosin attended a school meeting halfway through the academic year in 2015, it was announced that 42 Gunn students had been hospitalized and treated for having suicidal thoughts since the fall. The city’s other public high school, Palo Alto High School, has a similarly accomplished record, with SAT scores surpassing state averages by nearly 200 points. The median household income in Palo Alto is $121,465 (double California’s median). In “The Problem With Rich Kids,” published by Psychology Today in November 2013, former Yale psychologist Suniya Luthar noted that social, emotional and behavioral issues are as prevalent in the wealthy end of the socioeconomic spectrum as they are on the poor end. She said that, on average, rich offspring experience serious levels of depression and anxiety at twice the national rates. “The evidence all points to one cause underlying the different disturbances documented: pressure for high-octane achievement,” Luthar wrote. “The children of affluent parents expect to excel at school and in multiple extracurriculars and also in their social lives. … It plays out in crippling anxiety and depression, about anticipated or perceived achievement ‘failures.'” Shortly after Lee’s death, a 16-year-old Gunn classmate named Martha Cabot uploaded a YouTube video urging Palo Alto parents to change their attitudes. “Students feel the constant need at our school of having to keep up with all the achievements,” she said. “I’m trying to raise awareness — especially for the parents. We love our moms and we love our dads, but calm down.” Students and alumni of Gunn and Palo Alto high schools have rallied around the cause of suicide prevention and awareness, eager to help their schools shed the reputation they have gained in recent years. A website called “Henry M. Gunn Gives Me Hope” collects pearls of optimism related to the school. One senior wrote: “Gunn gives me hope because even though we are an entirely new group of students, we are still able to react to our tragedies in supportive and caring ways. Although I certainly have not yet fully processed what has happened, our school has already gone to the ends of the earth to help students that are reeling.”	126	"[{""start"": 300, ""end"": 517, ""text"": ""It was in this way that a bright, popular, goofy kid named Cameron Lee ended his life in November 2014.

The Obama administration late Wednesday called for a ban on so-called “conversion” therapies that promise to cure gay and transgender people. The statement was issued in response to a White House petition signed by more than 120,000 people after the suicide of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn, a transgender teen from Ohio whose suicide note condemning the society’s treatment of transgender people went viral after her death. In the note, she indicated she had been subjected to such therapies. “The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,” Alcorn wrote in her note. The White House statement, issued by President Obama’s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, condemned “conversion” therapy, also known as “reparative” therapy, which she defined as any treatment aimed at changing a person’s sexual identity. “The overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrates that conversion therapy, especially when it is practiced on young people, is neither medically nor ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm,” she wrote. “As part of our dedication to protecting America’s youth, this Administration supports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors.” Shortly before releasing the White House response to the petition on conversion therapy, according to a White House official, Jarrett spoke with organizers of the petition. “She listened to their personal stories about why this was important to them and thanked them for their efforts,” said the official, who asked for anonymity in order to describe a private conversation. California, New Jersey and the District have banned licensed professionals from using the therapy on minors, and several other states are considering similar steps, including Iowa and Nevada. A similar bill that was being debated in Colorado apparently failed late Wednesday. This type of therapy has been condemned by a number of health organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy for Pediatrics. Exodus International, a group that had championed such therapies, shut down in 2013 and apologized to gays for the harm it had done. But some conservative Christian groups have defended the ability to change a person’s sexual orientation. “There are many psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and therapists who have reported success in treating clients for unwanted same-sex attractions,” Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council wrote in a position paper last year. Advocates for gay, bisexual and transgender people praised the White House. “Having President Obama and the weight of the White House behind efforts to ban conversion therapy is so critical in the fight for transgender and LGB young people,”  Mara Keisling, executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement. Obama has made expanding gay and transgender rights a hallmark of his presidency, three years after announcing he had “evolved” to support same-sex marriage. The military’s ban on open service by gays was lifted during his presidency, the Justice department has opposed same-sex marriage bans in court, and Obama last year signed an executive order requiring large federal contractors to have policies barring discrimination against gays. Wednesday’s statement comes as the administration has made several significant moves particularly on the issue of transgender rights. The Justice department on Monday filed suit against the University of Oklahoma for terminating a transgender professor. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has labeled discrimination against transgender people a prohibited form of sex discrimination. And on Wednesday, White House officials announced the designation of a one-person, “gender-neutral” bathroom in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, aimed at giving both staff and visitors the option of using a restroom that is not specifically associated with either men or women. Federal employees have had the option of using a restroom consistent with their gender identity since 2011. “The White House allows staff and guests to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity, which is in keeping with the administration’s existing legal guidance on this issue and consistent with what is required by the executive order that took effect today for federal contractors,” said White House spokesman Jeff Tiller in a statement. Jarrett also announced in an op-ed in the Advocate magazine that the executive order signed by Obama last year on federal contractors took effect Wednesday.	125	"[{""start"": 142, ""end"": 680, ""text"": ""The statement was issued in response to a White House petition signed by more than 120,000 people after the suicide of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn, a transgender teen from Ohio whose suicide note condemning the society’s treatment of transgender people went viral after her death.

A high school senior faces involuntary manslaughter charges in Massachusetts for urging her boyfriend to commit suicide, according to police. Michelle Carter, 18, is accused not only of failing to seek help for Conrad Roy III — who, police say, Carter knew intended to commit suicide — but also of texting him during the act and pressuring him to go through with it, according to authorities. In the more than 1,000 messages between the two, police found numerous texts sent to Roy indicating that Carter was communicating with him until the moments before his death last July. But there was one message that was particularly chilling, police say. Noting that he was afraid and didn’t want to leave his family, Roy noted that he got out of the truck where he would later be found dead. After texting Carter about his fears, she replied: “Get back in.” Roy was found in his truck dead of carbon monoxide poisoning the following day, July 13. “Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death,” Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Tom Quinn, said in a statement to the Sun Chronicle. In a report filed in New Bedford Juvenile Court, Fairhaven Police Detective Scott R. Gordon suggested that Carter encouraged Roy to kill himself while simultaneously putting together “a plan to get sympathy from her friends,” according to South Coast Today. [Inside Tumblr’s teen suicide epidemic] Gordon alleges that such a plan was evident because late on the night of July 11, two days before her boyfriend was found dead, Carter had “already started explaining (to friends) that it’s her fault that Conrad is dead, even though he was still alive and speaking and texting with her regularly.” That same day, Carter also texted Roy: “Let me know when you’re gonna do it.” In the months after Roy’s death, Carter helped raise thousands of dollars for suicide prevention in her dead boyfriend’s name. But writing to friends after Roy’s body was discovered, police say, Carter appeared to acknowledge that her messages to her boyfriend were intended to encourage him to go through with the suicide. “[H]is death is my fault like honestly I could have stopped him I was on the phone with him and he got out of the car because it was working and he got scared,” Carter texted a friend Sept. 14, according to the Boston Herald. “I [expletive] told him to get back in … because I knew he would do it all over again the next day and I couldn’t have him live the way he was living anymore I couldn’t do it I wouldn’t let him…” Carter’s parents say that their daughter, an honor roll student, is being unfairly portrayed as a villain. [One teen charged with killing two homeless men was once homeless himself, his father said] “Our hearts have and remain broken for the Roy family,” her parents said in a statement, according to the Boston Herald. “For everyone that does not know our daughter, she is not the villain the media is portraying her to be.” They added: “She is a quiet, kind, and sympathetic young girl. She tried immensely to help Mr. Roy in his battle with depression. We know that once all of the facts are released, our daughter will be found innocent.” Carter was indicted Feb. 6 on charges stemming from Roy’s death. Charging documents, filed in juvenile court because Carter was 17 at the time of the suicide, were obtained last week by local news organizations. The charges have added a horrifying dimension to an already tragic story, particularly for Roy’s family, which is now reliving the worst moments of his death. Janice Roy told CBS affiliate WBZ that despite her grandson’s long struggle with depression, she believes he could have been persuaded to not follow through with his suicide plan. “We were hoping,” she told the stations. “He seemed to be pulling out of it.” Of hearing about the text messages, she said: “I felt like the blood drained out of me. I don’t believe this, it’s too horrific.” [Manassas City detective in teen ‘sexting’ case sues teen’s lawyer for defamation] It’s a dramatic turn of events for Carter, who in the months after Roy’s death mourned him publicly and used his death as a catalyst for activism on suicide prevention. In messages on Twitter, Carter wrote, “such a beautiful soul gone too soon.” And, “I will never understand why this had to happen.” Carter’s Twitter account has since been deleted and she is prohibited from using social media while charges are pending. She helped plan a fundraising softball tournament for Roy called “Homers for Conrad.” But even that raised the suspicions of Roy’s friends, who told police that she was “looking for attention” after Roy’s death, according to court documents obtained by the Boston Herald. Roy’s best friend told Gordon, the detective, that Carter accused him of trying to take “credit” for the fundraiser idea and that her name was added to the fundraiser’s Facebook page because “it bothered her” that she wasn’t listed, according to the Herald. His friend apparently had no idea that the two were in a relationship. “He further explained that (Carter) was getting so involved in it, and he was just curious about how she knew Conrad, and Michelle said that they had been dating on and off for 2 years and (he) said at that point that he had never heard of her, so he didn’t know exactly if that was true or not,” Gordon wrote, according to the Herald. “Carter has a history of being the ‘girl that cried wolf,’ and sometimes (it) was hard to tell if she was being totally truthful,” another friend told police, according to the report. Carter’s attorney remains confident that the case has no merit and has accused the Bristol County District Attorney’s Office of bias. Quinn, the district attorney, is Roy’s third cousin and has recused himself from the case. “Everyone in that office knows that they are prosecuting somebody who is alleged to have caused the death of their boss’s cousin,” said Carter’s attorney, Joseph Cataldo, according to the Boston Herald. “I don’t know how you can separate that and have somebody objectively looking at this … as a prosecutor needs to do.” Carter was released on $2,500 bail and will be tried as an adult.	124	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 140, ""text"": ""A high school senior faces involuntary manslaughter charges in Massachusetts for urging her boyfriend to commit suicide, according to police"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 942, ""end"": 1325, ""text"": ""Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death,” Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Tom Quinn, said in a statement to the Sun Chronicle"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	134	2023-03-20T11:32:22.781991Z	2023-03-20T11:32:22.782106Z	482.942
Authorities in Polk County, Fla., have arrested two girls, ages 12 and 14, who they claim are partly responsible for the suicide of Rebecca Ann Sedwick last month. Sedwick, 12, was bullied cruelly and at length by a group of her peers before she hurled herself from the top of a tower at an abandoned concrete plant, according to authorities, who said they made the arrests to protect other children: [Polk County Sheriff Grady] Judd said he arrested the 14-year-old girl after she posted online Saturday that she bullied Rebecca and she didn’t care. “We decided that we can’t leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?” Judd said. Police also arrested a 12-year-old girl who is accused of bullying Rebecca. Both have been charged with felony aggravated stalking. The sheriff’s office identified the two girls, but the Associated Press generally does not name juveniles charged with crimes. Judd said the bullying began after the 14-year-old girl started dating a boy that Rebecca had been seeing. She “didn’t like that and began to harass and ultimately torment Rebecca,” Judd said. The 12-year-old girl was Rebecca’s former best friend, but Judd said the 14-year-old girl turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped being friends with her for fear of being bullied, the sheriff said. Authorities have said Rebecca was “terrorized” by as many as 15 girls who ganged up on her and picked on her for months through online message boards and texts. Associated Press The sheriff’s office gave a detailed account of Sedwick’s ordeal: The 14-year-old girl had several arguments with Rebecca via Facebook, as well as verbal confrontations at school. Witnesses told investigators that the girl sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to drink bleach and die, and telling Rebecca that she should kill herself. Rebecca was jumped in school and later bombarded with such hateful messages via a cellphone application as “You’re ugly,” “Why are you still alive?” and “Go kill yourself.” In February, the 12-year-old was suspended from school after allegedly attacking Rebecca. The sheriff’s office said the 14-year-old girl bullied anyone who was friends with Rebecca, making students fearful of befriending Rebecca. Her mother decided to home-school her daughter and eventually Rebecca transferred to Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, but detectives found evidence that the bullying continued on her cellphone. Orlando Sentinel Authorities reportedly arrested the two girls after the older one admitted online to having bullied Sedwick.	123	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 162, ""text"": ""s in Polk County, Fla., have arrested two girls, ages 12 and 14, who they claim are partly responsible for the suicide of Rebecca Ann Sedwick last month"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1584, ""end"": 1696, ""text"": ""The 14-year-old girl had several arguments with Rebecca via Facebook, as well as verbal confrontations at school"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1698, ""end"": 2044, ""text"": ""Witnesses told investigators that the girl sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to drink bleach and die, and telling Rebecca that she should kill herself.

Michelle Carter knew that if anyone found her text messages to her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, she might go to jail. “[If the police] read my messages with him I’m done. His family will hate me and I can go to jail,” Carter texted a friend after her 18-year-old boyfriend used a gas-powered water pump to commit suicide in the parking lot of a K-Mart. Carter had asked Roy in a text message to delete her messages before he carried out the suicide last summer, but investigators found them anyway. According to prosecutors, Carter pressured her boyfriend to go through with suicide for almost a week before he carried out the act. She counseled him to overcome his fears; researched methods of committing suicide painlessly; and lied to police, his family and her friends about his whereabouts during the act itself and after, prosecutors said. Carter, who was 17 at the time of Roy’s death, now faces manslaughter charges in juvenile court in Massachusetts. Her attorney argues, however, that the charges should be dropped because Carter’s messages are protected by free speech. According to attorney Joseph P. Cataldo, Carter was “brainwashed” into supporting Roy’s plan for suicide. “He ultimately persuaded a young, impressionable girl,” Caldato told reporters, according to South Coast Today. “Eventually he gets her to endorse his plan.” [‘Get back in’: Teen charged with pressuring boyfriend to commit suicide] But in an indictment, prosecutors outlined in nauseating detail the extent of Carter’s alleged role in helping Roy overcome his doubts about suicide. For more than a week in July 2014, Carter and Roy exchanged hundreds of messages in which Carter insisted that Roy would be better off dead. “You’re finally going to be happy in heaven. No more pain,” she told him in one message. “It’s okay to be scared and it’s normal. I mean, you’re about to die.” According to prosecutors, the two had struck up a romantic relationship — mostly online — in 2012. Her lawyer says they had only met a few times in person over the course of two years prior to Roy’s death. Roy had a history of depression and had attempted suicide in the past, but his family was hopeful that he would get through it. “He seemed to be pulling out of it,” his grandmother Janice Roy told WBZ.  [How to talk to your teen about depression, suicide] Text messages recovered by police, however, suggest that by 2014, Carter had gotten tired of Roy’s idle talk of suicide and she wanted him to go through with it  — now. “You always say you’re gonna do it, but you never do,” Carter complained. “I just want to make sure tonight is the real thing.” Another time, she texted: “You can’t keep pushing it off, though. That’s all you keep doing.” [‘I needed to do this’: A school shooter’s final texts before gunning down his friends] Carter was insistent, even when Roy steered the topic to other things: ROY: How was your day? CARTER: When are you doing it? Roy said he was having a good day, but Carter wasn’t satisfied. CARTER: Really? ROY: Yes. CARTER: That’s great. What did you do? ROY: Ended up going to work for a little bit and then just looked stuff up. CARTER: When are you gonna do it? Stop ignoring the question??? Roy had doubts, and he was scared, according to his texts. What if it didn’t work and he ended up injured for the rest of his life? How would his family cope with the loss? Carter had answers. He would be her guardian angel in heaven. She would comfort his family and they would move on. If he followed the directions he had found online for killing himself with carbon monoxide, it would “100 percent work,” she said. “There isn’t anything anyone can do to save you, not even yourself,” she told him. But committing suicide would require tools. Roy thought about using a tube to channel the exhaust from his truck’s tailpipe into the vehicle but realized that the diesel engine emitted lower levels of carbon monoxide that might make failure more likely. Carter was confident that it would work and told him why. If the truck emitted a specific amount of carbon monoxide “for five or ten minutes, you will die,” she told him. “You lose consciousness with no pain. You just fall asleep and die.” But Carter didn’t love that idea, either, because she feared that Roy would make up an “excuse” to explain why it didn’t work. “I bet you’re gonna be like ‘oh, it didn’t work because I didn’t tape the tube right or something like that,'” she texted him “You always seem to have an excuse.” When Roy decided to use a generator instead, Carter was impatient. “Do you have the generator?” she asked him. “Not yet LOL,” he replied. “WELL WHEN ARE YOU GETTING IT?” she wrote. Eventually, Roy did find a generator — his father’s — but it was broken. Carter told him to take it to Sears for repairs. And if Roy couldn’t find a way to use carbon monoxide, Carter suggested alternatives: “I’d try the bag or hanging,” she told him. “Hanging is painless and take like a second if you do it right.” The day of Roy’s death — July 12, 2014 — he and Carter exchanged texts in the early morning hours. “You can’t think about it. You just have to do it,” Carter said, telling him she didn’t understand why he was hesitating. “I’m gonna eventually,” he replied. “I really don’t know what I’m waiting for but I have everything lined up.” She suggested that he take medication to fall asleep and allow the fumes to work. She worried that he wouldn’t go through with it because the sun would soon be coming up. She suggested that he go to an empty parking lot. They texted throughout the day about the plans, about Roy’s doubts, and about Carter’s insistence that “the time is right” and that he was ready. [Trying to quantify teen suicide] At the same time, Carter appeared to be preparing her friends and Roy’s relatives for his eventual death. Days before his suicide, Carter texted a friend named Samantha and claimed that Roy was missing — though she was communicating with him at exactly the same time about how to fix his father’s broken generator. The day before his death, she told her friend: “I’m thankful that our last words were I love you.” At some point on the night of July 12, Roy went through with the suicide, using a gas-powered water pump. He died of carbon monoxide poisoning inside the cab of his pickup truck. While he was in the truck with the pump running, he was on the phone texting and talking with Carter, she told her friend. “Like, honestly I could have stopped it,” Carter texted Samantha months later. “I was on the phone with him and he got out of the car” because the carbon monoxide was working, she said. She added that she “told him to get back in.” Roy’s body was found by police on the morning of July 13. A judge will now decide whether Carter will face charges in his death. She will appear in court again on Oct. 2. After his death, Carter became a self-proclaimed advocate for mental health. She organized a fundraising tournament in Roy’s memory and posted on Facebook and Twitter about her attempts to save her boyfriend’s life. “Even though I could not save my boyfriend’s life, I want to put myself out here to try to save as many other lives as possible,” she wrote on Facebook.

Posted by The Delaware Nation Lenni Lenape on Thursday, January 21, 2016 Police Chief Jason Smith’s heart broke when he learned about the suicide of Jaidon DuBois. Friends and family described the 16-year-old as thoughtful, good-looking nad earnest. He was the kind of kid who doled out hugs to everyone he came across, whose presence lit up rooms. Smith’s heart broke again weeks later, when a 21-year-old from his small town of Anadarko, Okla., shot and killed himself. And again, not long after that, when a local 22-year-old did the same. But when an 11-year-old committed suicide last week, the fourth person from Anadarko to kill him or herself in less than two months, it didn’t break Smith’s heart. It strengthened his resolve. Smith took to Facebook with a desperate plea for young people in his town: “I’m unsure and left at a loss [to] articulate words in this fourth case worked in the past few weeks,” he wrote, “But believe that as a community we can make a difference. If you are reading this post and you have thoughts of suicide please understand YOUR LIFE MATTERS!” “Not talking about the last three didn’t prevent the fourth one,” Smith told KOTV. He had to do something, Smith said in separate interview with KFOR. The suicides were devastating his town. “It has brought us to our knees,” he said. [After six Woodson High suicides, Fairfax County school community searches for solace and answers] It’s not clear what might be behind the rash of suicides in Anadarko, a town of about 6,700 people that’s about an hour’s drive from Oklahoma City. It’s a modest but proud place with a large Native American community. Many residents are farmers or work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs or various tribal offices. The town, named for the Nadaco tribe that lived there, calls itself the “Indian Capital of the Nation.” So far, the suicides — all of which involved guns — are just four data points on a chart with no discernible trend. The victims attended different schools or had completed school. DuBois’ father Jamie told KOTV that the 16-year-old suffered from depression and had been taking medication for his mental illness. The other three victims have not yet been named. It’s not clear that the incidents are connected at all, except by the fact that “they’ve been violent and they’ve really shook the community to the core,” Smith told KOTV. But something broader does seem to be at work. The national rate of suicide in 2014 was about 13 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Anadarko, the rate has been four times that over the course of just seven weeks. Smith told KFOR that police are investigating possible causes of the suicides, including looking into whether bullying was a factor. “If we could put it under a category, like bullying, we’d put our resources toward addressing bullying,” Smith told the Lawton, Okla. Constitution. “That’s the problem right now. There are so many causes. Suicide is a feeling of helplessness and that there’s nothing you feel you can do about it.” Meanwhile, residents of Anadarko are grappling with the gaping loss. “I knew every single one of them. I taught every single one of them or I was their principal and all of them are loved and they didn’t have to choose the course,” Lynn Bellamy, a longtime school teacher in Anadarko who is now pastor at the town’s First Baptist Church, told KFOR. First Baptist is handling the funeral arrangements for the latest victim, an 11-year-old boy. On Wednesday, as news of his suicide spread through town, a group of people gathered outside Anadarko High School holding signs against suicide. “You’re alive for a reason. Don’t ever give up,” one read, according to the Lawton Constitution. “We care. You are strong,” read another. Without an obvious link between the four deaths, city officials have no clear path to preventing more. Some fear that publicizing the deaths may make other teenagers and young adults at risk more likely to kill themselves. Donnie Edmondson, pastor of Virginia Avenue Baptist Church, told the Lawton Constitution that he worried that a “spirit of suicide” had taken hold of the town, a concern echoed by Smith. “Someone’s initials are on a bracelet that’s passed around and someone sees that and feels that’s how they can be recognized,” he told the Oklahoma paper. “That’s not the right way.” Research shows that adolescents are most susceptible to “suicide contagion” when one suicide is followed by a series of several others in an unsually short time frame. Last month, the Atlantic published a report on Silicon Valley high schools that have been plagued by clusters of suicide — the 10-year suicide rate at the schools is four to five times the national average. Closer to Washington, Fairfax County’s W.T. Woodson High School recently saw a spate of six suicides over the course of just three years. It’s not that one suicide suddenly gives others the same idea, according to a CDC report on suicide contagion. But news that someone has taken their own life — especially if it appears they did so as a way of “coping” with hardship — may persuade other, already vulnerable people to do the same. “Slowly, people just kept breaking down,” Bailey Bishop, a senior at W.T. Woodson, told The Washington Post in 2014. Native American teenagers commit suicide at a rate much higher than the national average, according to the CDC. A poisonous tangle of problems — poverty, unemployment, alcoholism, domestic violence, the devastating toll of history — that often persist in Native communities, coupled with an often-dire lack of mental health resources, leaves them even more vulnerable than the average teenager. It’s not clear how many of the victims in Anadarko were Native American. According to Census data, roughly 48 percent of residents identify as American Indian or Alaska Native. The town is home to a Bureau of Indian Affairs office that serves members of seven federally recognized tribes living in the area. Bellamy, the pastor at First Baptist Church in Anadarko, said he wants to convey that suicide isn’t a coping mechanism or solution to life’s problems — it’s only a source of more pain. “They see it as an option and it’s not an option. It’s the end. It’s final. All that’s left is the hurt and suffering of the family and friends,” he told KFOR. Edmondson and other local church leaders are organizing an outreach event for next Sunday for people affected by the tragedies — which, in this close-knit community, is basically everyone. The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health has set up a “care station” at the local hospital for people who need assistance themselves. The city manager is also looking into obtaining suicide prevention courses for the high school. And all around town, urgent fliers flap in the winter breeze. “When it seems like there’s no hope, there is help,” one reads, offering the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. “Honor your life.” Correction: Initial reports on the most recent suicide in Anadarko incorrectly identified the victim as a girl.
