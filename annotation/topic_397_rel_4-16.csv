The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s announcement on Monday that more than 4.7 million vehicles may be part of an urgent recall because of defective air bags has drawn so much interest that it crashed the Web site where people can go and check to see if their car is affected. The NHTSA put a notice up around noon that the site was having intermittent network problems.  “We’re aware of the situation and are working to get it back up as soon as possible,” NHTSA spokeswoman Kathryn Henry told The Washington Post about an hour later. “Please bear with us.” The recall concerns defective Takata airbags  in some vehicles. At least four people have died after inflator mechanisms ruptured on the air bags, spraying the passengers with metal fragments. NHTSA has warned affected drivers to take their vehicles to the dealers immediately. Safety experts said about 12 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled over the airbag problem. NHTSA said it was particularly urgent for vehicles owners in Florida, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands and Hawaii to take immediate action. The federal safety agency said car owners uncertain about whether their vehicle is equipped with a Takata airbag can check at www.safercar.gov/(when the Web site is back up). You will need your vehicle identification number (VIN) to check. Below is a list of vehicle makes and models that may be affected: Toyota: 778,177 vehicles potentially affected. 2002-2004 Lexus SC, 2003-2004 Toyota Corolla, 2003-2004 Toyota Corolla Matrix, 2002-2004 Toyota Sequoia, 2003-2004 Toyota Tundra, 2003-2004 Pontiac Vibe Honda: 2,803,214 vehicles potentially affected. 2001-2007 Honda Accord (4 cylinder), 2001-2002 Honda Accord (6 cylinder), 2001-2005 Honda Civic, 2002-2006 Honda CR-V, 2003-2011 Honda Element, 2002-2004 Honda Odyssey, 2003-2007 Honda Pilot, 2006 Honda Ridgeline, 2003-2006 Acura MDX, 2002-2003 Acura TL/CL Nissan: 437,712 vehicles potentially affected. 2001-2003 Nissan Maxima, 2001-2003 Nissan Pathfinder, 2002-2003 Nissan Sentra, 2001- 2003 Infiniti I30/I35, 2002-2003 Infiniti QX4, 2003 Infiniti FX Mazda: 18,050 vehicles potentially affected. 2003-2004 Mazda6, 2004 Mazda RX-8 BMW: 573,935 vehicles potentially affected. 2000-2005 3 Series Sedan, 2000-2006 3 Series Coupe, 2000- 2005 3 Series Sports Wagon, 2000-2006 3 Series Convertible, 2001-2006 M3 Coupe, 2001-2006 M3 Convertible GM: 133,221 vehicles potentially affected. 2002-2003 Buick LeSabre, 2002-2003 Buick Rendezvous, 2002-2003 Cadillac DeVille, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Impala, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Venture, 2002-2003 GMC Envoy, 2002-2003 GMC Envoy XL, 2002-2003 Oldsmobile Aurora, 2002-2003 Oldsmobile Bravada, 2002-2003 Oldsmobile Silhouette, 2002-2003 Pontiac Bonneville, 2002-2003 Pontiac Montana	75	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 291, ""text"": ""The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s announcement on Monday that more than 4.7 million vehicles may be part of an urgent recall because of defective air bags has drawn so much interest that it crashed the Web site where people can go and check to see if their car is affected"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 639, ""end"": 767, ""text"": ""At least four people have died after inflator mechanisms ruptured on the air bags, spraying the passengers with metal fragments."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 768, ""end"": 851, ""text"": ""A has warned affected drivers to take their vehicles to the dealers immediately"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 853, ""end"": 951, ""text"": ""Safety experts said about 12 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled over the airbag problem"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 953, ""end"": 1120, ""text"": ""NHTSA said it was particularly urgent for vehicles owners in Florida, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands and Hawaii to take immediate action"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 953, ""end"": 1120, ""text"": ""NHTSA said it was particularly urgent for vehicles owners in Florida, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands and Hawaii to take immediate action"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 0, ""end"": 173, ""text"": ""The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s announcement on Monday that more than 4.7 million vehicles may be part of an urgent recall because of defective air bag"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	86	2023-03-17T12:32:37.717984Z	2023-03-17T12:32:37.718069Z	154.865
automotive U.S. demands data on Takata air bags U.S. safety regulators are ordering Japanese auto supplier Takata to provide more information about air bags that can explode and shoot shrapnel toward drivers and passengers. The order sent Thursday makes 36 requests for information on production mistakes, lawsuit settlements and reports of deaths or injuries that the Tokyo-based company has received. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also wants to know how many replacement parts Takata can make each day and what it has discussed with automakers and competitors. Takata has until Dec. 1 to submit the information or it could face fines of $7,000 a day. A Takata spokesman said the company is cooperating and will work to meet the agency’s requests. Ten automakers have recalled nearly 8 million vehicles in the United States — and 12 million worldwide — equipped with potentially faulty Takata air bag inflators. Safety advocates say the problem has caused four deaths in the U.S. Honda has been hit hardest, with about 5 million cars called back to repair their air bags. Thursday’s order is similar to one regulators sent to GM in March seeking more information about its ignition-switch recalls. GM missed the deadline and was fined $7,000 a day — a total of $420,000 — until it submitted all of the information in June. — Associated Press acquisitions Lockheed set to buy health-care tech firm Lockheed Martin is set to acquire the health-care technology company Systems Made Simple for an undisclosed sum, the Bethesda, Md.-based defense giant said Thursday. The deal is Lockheed’s seventh acquisition of the year and marks one more purchase in the health-care technology market, which many defense contractors see as a lucrative investment area. McLean, Va.-based Booz Allen Hamilton also bought two health-care companies recently. Systems Made Simple is a private company based in Syracuse, N.Y., that also has employees in McLean and Charlottesville. Founded in 1991, the company performs health-data analytics and management work for government agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. The company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. The purchase of Systems Made Simple is part of Lockheed’s strategy to grow within the “critical” federal health IT market, said Horace Blackman, vice president of Lockheed’s health and life sciences sector. The federal health-care market is viewed by many contractors as a bright spot in an otherwise slow federal spending environment. Many government agencies are looking to overhaul their health care systems, including the Department of Veterans Affairs. — Amrita Jayakumar Also in Business ● ●The Federal Trade Commission accused baby-food maker Gerber of claiming falsely that its Good Start Gentle formula can prevent or reduce allergies in children. A complaint filed in federal court in Washington alleged that the company misled consumers by suggesting that its formula was the first to meet government approval for reducing the risk of allergies. The FTC wants Gerber to pull its claim from labels and advertisements.Gerber said it did not violate the law. ● Citigroup is slashing its third-quarter earnings by $600 million, saying recent investigations by regulators have altered the results it reported earlier this month. The bank, based in New York, revised its quarterly net income to $2.8 billion from a previously reported $3.4 billion, citing legal expenses. The company said the unexpected increase came from “rapidly-evolving regulatory inquiries and investigations, including very recent communications with certain regulatory agencies related to previously disclosed matters.” ● Visa shares jumped 10 percent to $236.65 after turning in quarterly earnings late Wednesday that topped Wall Street’s forecasts. The world’s largest payment-processing company announced plans to spend as much as $5 billion on buying its own shares. MasterCard, the world’s second-largest card-payment company, said its third-quarter profit surged as Americans appeared less hesitant to use their debit and credit cards. The results beat Wall Street’s expectations, propelling MasterCard’s stock up 9 percent to $83.13. ● Wal-Mart is considering matching online prices from competitors such as Amazon.com. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., has matched prices of local store competitors but has not followed other retailers including Best Buy and Target, in matching prices of online rivals. But last month Wal-Mart started to test the strategy in five markets: Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Phoenix and northwest Arkansas. ● Starbucks’ relaunch of its popular Pumpkin Spice latte drink failed to heat up business at its U.S. cafes, disappointing Wall Street and sending the company’s shares down almost 5 percent. The world’s biggest coffee chain said a 1 percent increase in traffic contributed to a 5 percent gain in sales at Americas-region cafes open at least 13 months. But that result fell short of the 6.2 percent gain expected by analysts. The Seattle-based company reported quarterly net income of $587.9 million. — From news services Coming Today ● 8:30 a.m.: Personal income and spending for September. ● Earnings: Berkshire Hathaway, Exxon Mobil, Graham Holdings, Hilton Worldwide Holdings.	74	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 222, ""text"": ""e U.S. demands data on Takata air bags U.S. safety regulators are ordering Japanese auto supplier Takata to provide more information about air bags that can explode and shoot shrapnel toward drivers and passengers"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 224, ""end"": 401, ""text"": ""The order sent Thursday makes 36 requests for information on production mistakes, lawsuit settlements and reports of deaths or injuries that the Tokyo-based company has received"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 774, ""end"": 933, ""text"": ""utomakers have recalled nearly 8 million vehicles in the United States — and 12 million worldwide — equipped with potentially faulty Takata air bag inflators."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 934, ""end"": 1092, ""text"": ""Safety advocates say the problem has caused four deaths in the U.S. Honda has been hit hardest, with about 5 million cars called back to repair their air bags"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 0, ""end"": 222, ""text"": ""automotive U.S. demands data on Takata air bags U.S. safety regulators are ordering Japanese auto supplier Takata to provide more information about air bags that can explode and shoot shrapnel toward drivers and passengers"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 224, ""end"": 402, ""text"": ""he order sent Thursday makes 36 requests for information on production mistakes, lawsuit settlements and reports of deaths or injuries that the Tokyo-based company has received."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	85	2023-03-17T12:30:00.439609Z	2023-03-17T12:30:00.439752Z	282.325
Federal officials dialed up the largest consumer recall in history Tuesday, ordering auto manufacturers to replace defective air bags made by auto-parts giant Takata in a whopping 33.8 million vehicles. But neither automakers nor the government has made it easy to find out whether your car is included — and how it should be fixed. Federal officials have released only a partial list of affected vehicles (see below). Consumers can also enter their VIN numbers — the 17-character serial number usually located on the dash of a car — on the Web site SaferCar.gov. That will show car owners every recall associated with their vehicles. But the site does not include all of the vehicles affected by Tuesday’s massive recall. That’s because federal transportation officials said they need to do more tests and coordinate with automakers before putting cars on the final recall list — an effort that could take days to complete. Fixing the problem will be even more complex, with federal officials forecasting that it could be months or years before the auto industry makes enough air bags to replace the defective ones. Consumers reported Tuesday that they got conflicting answers or no answers at all when they called dealerships about the recall. Meanwhile, car manufacturers said people should continue to drive their vehicles — even those with the deadly defect — until the parts arrive at their local dealerships. This left car owners with a pressing question that neither federal officials nor automakers seemed to be able to answer Tuesday: Is my car safe to drive?

Federal regulators on Tuesday ordered air-bag maker Takata to pay a cash fine of $70 million and to speed up the replacement of defective safety devices that are in millions of cars and have killed seven people in the United States. Takata also agreed to give an outside monitor appointed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration “unrestricted access” to company documents and other information over five years to ensure the company complies with the terms of a consent order Tuesday and another from May. That was in part a reaction to a history of bad information from the company, according to Tuesday’s order. “In several instances, Takata produced testing reports that contained selective, incomplete or inaccurate data,” according to the order, which noted that the company also “failed to clarify inaccurate information provided” to traffic safety administration regulators during a January 2012 presentation. NHTSA also said that Takata faces much larger civil penalties, including $60 million if the company misses deadlines for phasing out production of some air bags and $70 million if additional safety violations are discovered. If they all applied, the civil penalties would be nearly twice the largest ever issued by NHTSA. But they pale in comparison to the $1.2 billion in criminal fines against Toyota in connection with the sudden acceleration of its vehicles, and the $900 million in such levies against General Motors for ignition-switch problems. Tuesday’s Takata settlement does nothing to impede an ongoing criminal investigation of the company by federal prosecutors, a federal official said. Shigehisa Takada, Takata’s chairman and chief executive, said, “We deeply regret the circumstances that led to this Consent Order,” adding that Tuesday’s settlement “marks a pivot point for Takata by setting out an orderly transition to the next generation of inflaters.” NHTSA officials said they are, for the first time, using their authority to speed up the repairs on millions of recalled vehicles, finding that “there is a risk of serious injury or death” if the fixes are not accelerated. Eleven auto manufacturers have issued recalls for Takata air bags, and in certain cases a propellant problem has caused “explosive ruptures,” federal officials said. In addition to the deaths, those ruptures have caused nearly 100 injuries when drivers and passengers are struck by shrapnel from the bags. The safety agency had manufacturers help come up with a “risk-based framework” for speeding up replacement of the air bags, which federal officials said are in 19 million vehicles. Key factors include the age of the air bag (older is worse), where they are placed (more fatalities have occurred on the driver side), and the geography and climate (hot and humid is bad). In particular, “vehicles that have spent significant continuous time periods in areas of high absolute humidity, such as the Gulf Coast region and Puerto Rico, are at a higher risk of rupture,” according to a federal outline of the agreement. The highest-risk vehicles are “generally those from model years 2008 or older that have spent time in the high absolute humidity region and that have either a recalled driver-side inflator or both driver- and passenger-side inflators,” according to the outline. NHTSA ordered all affected carmakers to guarantee that they have “sufficient remedy parts on hand” by March 31, 2016. Other risk groups have later deadlines in 2016. But people still have to repair their cars to purge the potentially deadly parts. Federal officials gave manufacturers 90 days to come up with “recall engagement plans” outlining how they propose to “maximize remedy completion rates.”	72	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 232, ""text"": ""al regulators on Tuesday ordered air-bag maker Takata to pay a cash fine of $70 million and to speed up the replacement of defective safety devices that are in millions of cars and have killed seven people in the United States."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 0, ""end"": 92, ""text"": ""al regulators on Tuesday ordered air-bag maker Takata to pay a cash fine of $70 million"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1903, ""end"": 2124, ""text"": ""NHTSA officials said they are, for the first time, using their authority to speed up the repairs on millions of recalled vehicles, finding that “there is a risk of serious injury or death” if the fixes are not accelerated"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2126, ""end"": 2290, ""text"": ""Eleven auto manufacturers have issued recalls for Takata air bags, and in certain cases a propellant problem has caused “explosive ruptures,” federal officials said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2292, ""end"": 2430, ""text"": ""In addition to the deaths, those ruptures have caused nearly 100 injuries when drivers and passengers are struck by shrapnel from the bags"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3473, ""end"": 3554, ""text"": ""But people still have to repair their cars to purge the potentially deadly parts."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	83	2023-03-17T12:22:45.395102Z	2023-03-17T12:22:45.395200Z	442.995
RECALLS NHTSA seeks details from air-bag maker The U.S. government’s auto safety agency, responding to criticism of its slow response to safety issues, told the manufacturer of millions of potentially faulty air bags to make replacement parts faster and do more testing to find the cause of the problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent letters Wednesday to Japanese air-bag maker Takata and 10 automakers seeking information in a widening air-bag recall that now covers nearly 8 million U.S. vehicles. The vehicles are equipped with Takata air bags that can potentially inflate with too much force, blowing apart metal canisters and sending shards flying at drivers and passengers. Safety advocates say four people have died because of the problem. Tests by Takata have shown that prolonged exposure to high humidity can cause the inflators to malfunction. Some automakers have limited their recalls to a small number of high-humidity areas, but lawmakers and others are demanding that recalls be expanded nationwide. The letters sent to automakers urge them to speed up owner notification and replacement part distribution. In his letter to Takata, NHTSA Deputy Administrator David J. Friedman said those efforts will fail if the air-bag maker does not produce enough parts. “Takata’s production capacity is critically important,” Friedman wrote. “Production of replacement parts must not just be expedited, it must be prioritized.” NHTSA also asked the automakers for test results on air bags that were sold outside ­high-humidity areas. Automakers have different boundaries for recall zones, which has confused consumers. NHTSA said the affected area includes Florida; Puerto Rico; limited areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Louisiana; and Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii. Also Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office to investigate NHTSA. The panel said that the agency responds slowly to safety issues. — Associated Press TECHNOLOGY Mobile profit plunges 74% for Samsung Samsung Electronics said Thursday that operating profit from its smartphone business plunged 74 percent in the third quarter to its lowest in more than three years amid slowing sales of its flagship Galaxy handsets. The drop battered the South Korean company’s overall quarterly net profit, which tumbled 49 percent to $4 billion — the lowest since the first quarter of 2012, but above market expectations. Operating income from its mobile business, which previously had contributed more than 60 percent of Samsung’s total profit, fell to $1.66 billion from $6.4 billion a year earlier. That was the lowest since the third quarter of 2011. Samsung had warned earlier this month that its handset profit declined despite a marginal shipment increase. Analysts said the Galaxy S5 smartphone launched in April did not sell well. Many consumers held off upgrading their phones, instead waiting for Apple’s new iPhones. — Associated Press ALSO IN BUSINESS ● Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced Wednesday that it will spin off sports carmaker Ferrari into a separate company. Fiat Chrysler also said it is recalling more than 566,000 trucks and SUVs in two recalls for malfunctioning fuel heaters that can cause fires and a software glitch that can disable the electronic stability control. The largest of the recalls covers nearly 382,000 Ram 2500 and 3500 pickups and Ram 4500 and 5500 chassis cabs from 2010 through 2014. The second recall covers more than 184,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs from 2014. ● Microsoft notified 3,000 more workers that they are being laid off. This means that virtually all of the planned 18,000 job eliminations the company announced in July are now completed. Wednesday’s layoffs cut across different groups and geographic areas, but most of them were in finance, human resources, marketing and other support functions. The company’s acquisition of Nokia’s phone business brought in some 25,000 Nokia workers to Microsoft. Most of the 18,000 cuts — about 12,500 professional and factory jobs — were former Nokia positions. ● Kraft Foods Group said quarterly profit fell nearly 11 percent as price hikes, designed to offset higher commodity costs, hit demand for popular products such as Velveeta cheese and Jell-O desserts. The company, which also makes Oscar Mayer meats and Kool-Aid beverages, has been raising prices on more than half of its products. Kraft’s net income fell to $446 million in the third quarter from $500 million a year earlier. Revenue edged up 0.1 percent, to $4.40 billion. ● United Parcel Service forecast that it will deliver more than 585 million packages in December. That is up 11 percent from a year ago, when harsh weather and a surge of last-minute online retail orders overwhelmed UPS’s capacity and forced it to miss some Christmas deliveries. UPS said it expects shipments to peak Dec. 22, when it predicts dropping off more than 34 million packages. Last year’s one-day record of 31 million packages is expected to be surpassed on six days this year, the company said.● — From news services COMING TODAY ● 8:30 a.m.: Third-quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims. ● 10 a.m.: Weekly mortgage rates. ● Earnings: Altria Group, Groupon, LinkedIn, Starbucks.

Honda said Monday that it failed to report 1,729 incidents in which one of its vehicles caused an injury or death. Blaming the failure on “inadvertent” data entry and computer programming errors, Honda said an independent audit of its records between 2003 and 2014 discovered the failure to provide accurate incident reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In a conference call with reporters Monday afternoon, Rick Schostek, executive vice president of Honda, said the company also was slow to react when it discovered its quarterly safety reports were flawed. “Honda acknowledges that it lacked the urgency needed to correct its problems on a timely basis,” Schostek said, reading from a prepared statement. He declined to take questions about the audit, saying it hadbeen filed with NHTSA on Monday and citing the possibility of further lawsuits from injured Honda owners. “We received Honda’s response to our Special Order and will immediately begin reviewing the documents as part of our ongoing investigation into Honda’s failure to report airbag-related injuries and deaths in a timely manner,” said Kevin Vincent, chief counsel at NHTSA. At issue is the Takata air bag that NHTSA says has been installed in at least 5 million Hondas, as well as millions of vehicles made by other major auto manufacturers worldwide. At least five people have died and scores were injured when Takata air bags sprayed them with shrapnel when they deployed during crashes. The working theory has been that the air bags’ inflator canisters can malfunction when exposed to consistently high humidity. Honda, Takata’s biggest customer, has recalled 6.2 million cars with Takata air bags worldwide, and 4.1 million in humid regions of the United States. Instead of reporting all 2,873 claims involving deaths or injury over the 11-year period, the audit found that Honda told ­NHTSA only about claims that had been denied. The 1,729 it failed to report were those it paid and counted as warranty claims. One of the incidents involved a death. NHTSA last week asked Honda and nine other automakers — BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota to provide documents and a sworn detailed account of all past or current testing they did of Takata inflators outside current recall areas. NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman said he would take steps to force the nationwide recall if the companies are reluctant. Friedman said only the automakers can say for sure how many vehicles that would involve, but it has been estimated it could amount to 20 million cars and cost Takata an estimated $852 million. Takata has resisted the call for a nationwide recall, suggesting it should focus on more humid regions where replacement air bags are most needed. If the recall goes nationwide, it will be one of the largest in U.S. automotive history. Takata air bags are installed in 1 in 5 vehicles worldwide. Sens. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.V.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) sent Takata a lengthy list of questions they said were unanswered by Hiroshi Shimizu, a Takata vice president, at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last week. The senators want to know whether Takata engineers questioned the safety of using ammonium nitrate as a propellant in the air-bag canisters. They also asked for internal documents and communications that they believe could point to a coverup of the defects by Takata employees. The senators asked for details of Takata’s ability to produce replacement air bags in sufficient quantity to keep up with the recalls. “Mr. Shimizu was unable to sufficiently answer many questions about the current production and safety testing of replacement air bags for vehicles currently covered by recalls or safety improvement campaigns,” Rockefeller and Nelson wrote to the company’s chief executive, Shigehisa Takada. “As a result, we still have many significant questions about the circumstances surrounding Takata’s manufacturing of defective air bags and their widespread distribution and installation in vehicles sold and driven in the United States.”	70	"[{""start"": 900, ""end"": 1167, ""text"": ""We received Honda’s response to our Special Order and will immediately begin reviewing the documents as part of our ongoing investigation into Honda’s failure to report airbag-related injuries and deaths in a timely manner,” said Kevin Vincent, chief counsel at NHTSA"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1347, ""end"": 1484, ""text"": ""At least five people have died and scores were injured when Takata air bags sprayed them with shrapnel when they deployed during crashes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1485, ""end"": 1761, ""text"": ""The working theory has been that the air bags’ inflator canisters can malfunction when exposed to consistently high humidity.

"Authorities have blamed eight fatalities on what they say are defective air bags manufactured by the Japanese auto-parts maker Takata. They say Takata's flawed components are in millions of vehicles, posing serious risks to their owners. On the whole, however, cars are far safer than they've ever been. Air bags, which save the lives of thousands of drivers and passengers every year, are among several technologies that have contributed to an extraordinary reduction in the number of deaths on the road. You rarely hear about the deadly wrecks that don't happen, though. Authorities say Takata's air bags are defective and can explode in a collision, sending shrapnel toward passengers. After regulators accused Takata of misrepresenting test data and demanded a $70 million fine on Tuesday, the firm lost its most important customer, as Honda announced it would no longer use Takata's products in new models. The defective air bags are in cars sold by 10 other manufacturers besides Honda. ""We deeply regret the circumstances"" that brought on the fine, Takata's chairman, Shigehisa Takada, said Tuesday. [Read more: Takata fined $70 million for deadly air bags, subjected to outside overseer] Takata's air bags aren't the first to be blamed for the deaths of people they were intended to protect. In a recent report, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration counted 290 fatalities due to air bags since 1990, many of them children riding in front. (The agency has required air bags in all cars since the 1998 model year.) Such deaths are now very rare. Parents are more aware of the risks of putting a child in the front seat, and some newer cars have sensors that can detect the size of the person in front of the air bag and inflate the bags with the appropriate force automatically. Federal analysts estimate that the devices have saved the lives of nearly 40,000 people who survived wrecks that would have been fatal without air bags. That's a reduction of about 12 percent in the number of traffic deaths. Air bags, seat belts, telescoping steering columns and other safety components now avert about 55.9 percent of traffic fatalities, according to a recent federal report. In other words, without any of these components, deaths on the road would be more than twice as frequent. Roughly 614,000 more people would have lost their lives on the road since 1960 -- not including those who are still alive due to improved medicine and safer driving. As the chart above shows, that's a huge increase from a time when safety technology in cars was still rare."	69	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 237, ""text"": ""s have blamed eight fatalities on what they say are defective air bags manufactured by the Japanese auto-parts maker Takata.

Honda said Wednesday that it will expand its recall of cars with potentially deadly air bags to all 50 states, a decision that could result in the recall of several million vehicles. Honda made the move one day after Takata, the Japanese auto supply company that makes the air bags, refused to comply with a federal demand that it expand the recall beyond several Southern states. If Takata had agreed to the recall order by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the automakers who install the company’s air bags would have been bound to carry it out. Honda Executive Vice President Rick Schostek announced the recall expansion at a hearing before a House subcommittee that heard testimony from two other automakers — Toyota and BMW — a Takata vice president and NHTSA Deputy Director David J. Friedman. In the face of sharp criticism from committee members, Takata’s Hiroshi Shimizu was unrelenting in insisting that the recall be limited to regions of the country with persistent high heat and humidity. Although conceding that the company has not found what causes the air bags to malfunction, spraying drivers and passengers with metal shards, Shimizu argued that the deaths and injuries it has investigated occurred in humid regions, primarily Florida and Puerto Rico. “The data indicates that we should remain focused on areas of high temperature and humidity,” Shimizu said. The response of Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) typified the skepticism Shimizu faced from the committee. “How many people would need to die before you would do a nationwide recall?” Long said. “It’s tantamount to driving down the road with a shotgun aimed at your chest.” When a vehicle is involved in a collision, sensors ignite a solid wafer of chemical propellant inside the metal canister of the air-bag inflator. A chemical reaction creates a gas that inflates the air bag within milliseconds, popping it from the steering wheel or dashboard. But if the propellant burns faster than intended, it produces more gas than the vents into the air bag can handle. The metal canister can break into fragments that spray the driver or passengers. At least five people have died and scores have been injured by Takata air bag malfunctions. “If our products are defective, supported by the scientific data, we are responsible,” Shimizu said. At least 7.8 million older-model cars equipped with Takata air bags have been subject to recalls that have been underway for several years. The recalls involve 10 automakers— Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, General Motors, Subaru, Ford, Chrysler, BMW and Nissan. Takata produces 1 in 5 air bags worldwide. Given that neither Takata nor auto manufacturers have been able to pinpoint the cause of the malfunctions, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) questioned the quality of air bags being installed in the recalled vehicles. “If you don’t know the root cause, how do you know that the replacement part that you’re supplying solves the problem?” Sarbanes said. Shimizu, who contends the problem is a manufacturing flaw rather than an engineering defect, said he was confident that replacement air bags supplied by the company are safe. At one point, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) said Shimizu’s responses were “nonsensical” and “confusing to drivers.” Several committee members also challenged the three automaker representatives at the hearing with a similar question: Would you allow a family member to drive a car with a Takata air bag? All three said that if a vehicle had been recalled, they would suggest that it immediately be taken in for a replacement air bag. “If they don’t feel safe, we will tow the vehicle,” Toyota Vice President Abbas Saadat said. That gave rise to questions about whether replacement air bags could be produced fast enough to meet the needs of the recall. Shimizu said the company is producing 300,000 air bags a year and would expand production to 450,000 units when new facilities come on line in January. He also said the company is working with two other suppliers to address the demand. “What does a driver do [with] a vehicle that’s in a recall that’s not going to be repaired for a year, year and a half?” Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) asked. Friedman told the committee that NHTSA would continue to take steps to force Takata to announce a nationwide recall, while working with automakers to ensure that they independently recall cars with Takata air bags. After the hearing, Friedman was asked if the replacement Takata air bags and those that automakers are installing in new vehicles are safer than the recalled models. He said the problem appears to develop several years into a vehicle’s life, so new air bags are likely to be safer. But will they have problems in five to 10 years? “You’re asking the exact same question we are,” Friedman said.

Auto parts giant Takata ignored deadly air-bag flaws and skipped global safety checks to save money in the years before the largest U.S. auto recall was launched, according to a congressional report cited during a hearing Tuesday into the defect that has left eight dead and more than 100 injured. But lawmakers at the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing focused their anger not just on Takata, but on federal safety regulators, who were criticized in a scathing Transportation Department inspector general’s audit for failing to protect drivers from disastrous defects. “This isn’t about resources. This is about blatant, incompetent mismanagement,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who called the Transportation Department IG’s audit of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration “one of the worst I’ve ever seen.” “If NHTSA doesn’t know when an investigation should be opened, we might as well shut it down,” she added. After months of testing, investigators have yet to identify a root cause for the Takata recall, which now includes about 34 million defective air-bag inflators in 32 million vehicles made by about a dozen of the world’s largest automakers. On Friday, an eighth death was conclusively tied to a faulty Takata air bag, which inflate with so much force that they blast out metal shards: a 26-year-old woman who rented a 2001 Honda Civic from a San Diego rental outlet, even though the car had been repeatedly recalled. Takata, one of the world’s biggest air-bag makers, was lambasted in the report issued by the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee’s Democratic minority, led by Sen. Bill Nelson (Fla.). Internal company e-mails “suggest that Takata may have prioritized profit over safety by halting global safety audits for financial reasons,” the report said. The Japanese auto parts supplier, the report said, knew of quality-control gaps in manufacturing as early as 2001 and at least three incidents involving faulty air-bag parts by 2007. Yet the first and smallest recall was not launched until 2008, and Takata fiercely resisted an expanded recall that would cover millions of additional defective cars. In one 2011 e-mail exchange quoted in the report, a supervisor at a Takata plant in Mexico told a quality engineer about inflators that were not properly welded: “We cannot be faced with findings/defects of this sort and NOT do ANYTHING. . . . A part that is not welded = one life less, which shows we are not fulfilling the mission.” The engineer agreed, saying “we are in a very critical situation because of the most recent problems that we have detected on the line. . . . Situations like this can give rise to a Recall.” Nevertheless, quality-control problems continued. Displaying a jagged chunk of metal that blasted out of an air bag and bloodied a Miami driver, Nelson said: “This is deadly serious business. . . . For years, Takata did not put safety first.” Takata’s North American executive vice president, Kevin Kennedy, disputed the report’s findings, saying that the internal e-mails were misconstrued and that routine audits of product safety and quality were never paused. Asked by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) whether Takata would establish a victims’ compensation fund similar to the General Motors fund covering ignition-switch defects, Kennedy said that Takata would deliver an answer within two weeks. Even without the fund, the Japanese firm is facing huge financial hits. A Fiat Chrysler executive said Tuesday that the carmaker would replace all recalled Takata driver-side air-bag inflators, in vehicles such as the Dodge Ram and Chrysler 300, with new parts from TRW Automotive, the biggest shift yet from a large automaker to one of Takata’s rival manufacturers. When pressed, the Fiat Chrysler executive said that the firm had switched suppliers because the firm had more confidence in the parts made by other manufacturers. Lawmakers said they were worried about the possibility that many more Takata deaths and injuries have yet to be discovered. Blumenthal compared the eight confirmed Takata deaths to those from General Motors’s ignition defects, which early estimates suggested had killed about a dozen people. The confirmed death count has since risen to 117. Meanwhile, many of the defective cars remain on the road while automakers struggle to get enough replacement parts. Takata has so far produced 5 million replacement kits, less than a sixth of the number needed, and executives expect the firm to be able to manufacture only a million replacement parts a month. A Honda Motor executive at the hearing said that the company’s vehicles were averaging more than 50,000 air-bag repairs a week, adding that company dealers were authorized to give rental cars to drivers whose recalled cars were undergoing repairs. Many vehicles have been given temporary air-bag fixes but will need further repairs. Takata said that it continues to use a chemical, ammonium nitrate, in its air bags to hurry along repairs, even though some experts have said that the propellant is unsafe. Some senators agreed with NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind’s insistence that the agency needed more money to manage an “overwhelming” flood of potential investigations and complaints. But lawmakers from both parties said that they would demand more far-reaching reforms before agreeing to invest more in the federal watchdog. “I’m not about to give you more money until I see meaningful progress,” McCaskill said.	67	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 296, ""text"": ""arts giant Takata ignored deadly air-bag flaws and skipped global safety checks to save money in the years before the largest U.S. auto recall was launched, according to a congressional report cited during a hearing Tuesday into the defect that has left eight dead and more than 100 injured"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 124, ""end"": 229, ""text"": ""argest U.S. auto recall was launched, according to a congressional report cited during a hearing Tuesday"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 960, ""end"": 1199, ""text"": ""After months of testing, investigators have yet to identify a root cause for the Takata recall, which now includes about 34 million defective air-bag inflators in 32 million vehicles made by about a dozen of the world’s largest automakers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1200, ""end"": 1475, ""text"": ""On Friday, an eighth death was conclusively tied to a faulty Takata air bag, which inflate with so much force that they blast out metal shards: a 26-year-old woman who rented a 2001 Honda Civic from a San Diego rental outlet, even though the car had been repeatedly recalled."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1710, ""end"": 1810, ""text"": ""Takata may have prioritized profit over safety by halting global safety audits for financial reason"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1830, ""end"": 2178, ""text"": ""he Japanese auto parts supplier, the report said, knew of quality-control gaps in manufacturing as early as 2001 and at least three incidents involving faulty air-bag parts by 2007.

If you are one of tens of ­millions of auto owners whose vehicle is recalled to replace an air bag that could explode and maim or kill you, one thing’s for sure: Someone else will be footing the bill. Just who should pay poses a rare question in an industry that has seen multiple recalls for a variety of defects this year. In most recalls, the company that built the troublesome product pays to fix it. But in this case, the automakers who are recalling and replacing faulty air bags simply installed a product made by someone else, Japanese auto-parts supplier Takata Corp. So far, Takata has resisted federal pressure that it issue its own recall of the potentially deadly air bags, insisting that the recall responsibility lies with the automakers themselves. “In any recall, the costs are largely determined by who is responsible for the recall,” said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “If a supplier produces a defective part that doesn’t meet the manufacturer’s requirements, the supplier will be charged for the recall.” At this point, Takata says it is unsure exactly what is causing the explosions. Five people have died and scores have been injured when the metal canister of a Takata air bag exploded during a collision, spraying the vehicle’s interior with sharp metal shards. Ford became the latest car company to expand its recall of cars with Takata driver-side air bags Thursday, adding 502,500 older model Mustangs to its recall list. Honda, Chrysler and Mazda had already expanded their recalls. They were among 10 car manufacturers who began a regional recall in June, focusing on areas of high heat and humidity where the air bags were believed more likely to malfunction. Before the carmakers added millions of vehicles to the recall this month, it was estimated that 20 million Takata-equipped cars were under recall orders. Neither Takata, which declined to comment, nor the automakers want to talk publicly about who will pay for the parts, labor and inconvenience of the recall. Several automakers have promised free loaner vehicles to customers while air bags are replaced. “I’m sorry, but I can’t get into the financial aspects of this action at this time,” said Chris Martin of Honda, which is recalling about 5.4 million cars in the United States. “Our primary focus is on repairing affected vehicles and addressing the needs and concerns of our customers.” The who-pays issue may be dictated by contracts between Takata and the automakers, and the question is sure to be under discussion as the recalls mount. “In these situations, it can require litigation to sort out the respective responsibility,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, “but if Takata really bears the lion’s share of responsibility, it may be cheaper, better for its reputation, and better for its future relationship with manufacturers, to absorb the recall cost or pay for most of it.” Peter Shervington, a London-based lawyer who specializes in dispute management, said carmakers are motivated to protect the reputation of their brand. “The automaker will want to be seen to be taking responsibility for its product, even if it is ultimately able to recover the cost of the recall from another party,” Shervington said. “They will be very concerned to ensure that their customers are not put at risk, and will also be conscious of the threat that, if they don’t act, the regulator will step in and force a recall.” The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is already taking steps to force a nationwide recall. Takata makes 1 in 5 air bags worldwide, has 55 factories in 20 countries and is among the world’s largest suppliers of auto parts. But the company hasn’t been able to keep up with the demand for replacement air bags, and its competitors are reluctant to ramp up production unless they get long-term commitments from automakers for their products. If Takata is saddled with the full cost of the recall, some question whether the company is too big to fail and say the automakers may want Takata to survive to preserve their source of air bags. “In many cases, there is a mutual interest in preserving commercial relationships and the parties are able to resolve the matter without the need for legal action,” Shervington said. The automakers may be motivated to absorb some of the cost because they recognize they, too, bear legal liability for the defect, said Jayne Conroy, a New York-based leading products liability lawyer. “There’s no way a company like Takata is completely responsible,” Conroy said. “We will find out that those car manufacturers told Takata exactly the size of the air bag component that needed to be put into the car, exactly what it should weigh. We will find ways that the car manufacturers are actually dictating to Takata what that product ought to look like.” She said consumer liability lawsuits may begin with Takata, but the car companies will feel the sting too. “I don’t know whether Takata is going to be big enough financially to withstand all of the litigation,” she said, “and I’m not sure that the car manufacturers should be off the hook for what I guarantee you was a composite effort.”	66	"[{""start"": 7, ""end"": 139, ""text"": ""are one of tens of ­millions of auto owners whose vehicle is recalled to replace an air bag that could explode and maim or kill you,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1045, ""end"": 1305, ""text"": ""At this point, Takata says it is unsure exactly what is causing the explosions.

It’s advice as true for U.S. Air Force fighters as it is for those trading credit-default swaps in Wall Street trading houses: “no guts, no glory.” And, in the case of one storied Japanese firm that had the guts to go for glory in an untested market — air bags — about 30 years ago, the advice has proved disastrous. Takata Corporation, a firm that punched above its weight when entering uncharted territory, must now deal with the biggest recall in history. “A recall of this scope illustrates the potential for massive automaker expense and consumer inconvenience when a common, mass-produced part is defective,” Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, told The Washington Post’s Drew Harwell. “Ironically, the use of common parts across markets and manufacturers is meant to save money, yet a recall of this size will cost the industry billions.” [Flawed Takata air bags in 34 million vehicles lead to biggest recall in history] But Takata, founded in 1933 in Japan, didn’t start out in the automobile business. For about two decades, the firm, which specialized in textiles, was content to make lifelines for parachutes. But, after the end of World War II, Takata got into seat belts. The business proved lucrative. Takata, according to the company’s Web site, staged the first public seat-belt crash tests using dummies. By the 1970s, it was working with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, creating child-safety seats and sponsoring an “International Seat Belt” symposium. Then the 1980s brought a moment of truth: Should the company start making air bags? Juichiro Takada, son of the company’s founder, wasn’t sure. “If anything happens to the airbags, Takata will go bankrupt,” Takada said, according to a Honda engineer, as Automotive News reported last year. “We can’t cross a bridge as dangerous as this.” But just like the three billy goats gruff, the company crossed the bridge to make itself fat. And, for a while, the feeding was good. “The bet paid off spectacularly,” Ben Klayman and Yoko Kubota of Reuters explained. “Air bags evolved from a pricey option to standard equipment on cars, and Takata became one of the top three manufacturers in the world.” And then it started to look like the company had eyes bigger than its stomach. Making air bags, it turned out, required more than just being really good at weaving. Air bags depend on, of all things, pyrotechnics. And pyrotechnics and textiles do not necessarily mix. “The tale that emerges from interviews with industry officials, chemical engineers, former U.S. safety officials and former Takata employees — as well as reviews of documents filed with U.S. regulators — is one of a company that lost its grip on quality,” Reuters wrote. “It’s a classic case study in how a lapse in quality-control rigor can prove extraordinarily costly to even a well-regarded, successful company.” It’s the explosives that proved a problem for Takata. The company tried for decades to make them more stable — with unclear results, as one lawyer for a man injured by an airbag in 2006 claimed. “The patents, some from as early as 1985, were intended to improve the ammonium nitrate propellants that help inflate the bags and strengthen their metal housing,” Automotive News wrote. “The applications provide ammunition for lawyers seeking to show the Japanese supplier could have acted sooner to head off defects linked to at least five deaths globally after air bags have deployed with too much force.” Even as the company battled arcane problems — the need for propellants to be placed in dry storage on weekends, the need for employees to wear anti-static shoes to prevent explosions at plants — people were dying. Sure, airbags may have saved more than 250,000 lives between 1975 and 2011, but Takata products had also allegedly killed, among others, an 18-year-old cheerleader in Oklahoma in 2009. A 33-year-old woman in Virginia that same year. A driver in Malaysia in 2014. Tests to determine the cause of the problems weren’t always conclusive, and words meant to sound reassuring often weren’t. “The cases all had completely different causes that led to recalls,” a company spokesman told Reuters last year. “If you ask me whether there was a causal relationship between them, I can only say that there wasn’t.” The company not only briefly installed its first non-Japanese president, but apologized. “Our whole company will strengthen our quality management structure and work to prevent an incident from occurring again,” Shigehisa Takada — son of Juichiro, grandson of Takata’s founder — said last year. Two months later, a 35-year-old father of two was allegedly killed by a Takata airbag in Houston. After this week’s historic recall, Takata, admitting it has a problem, seems to have a new attitude. “Up until now Takata has refused to acknowledge that their airbags are defective,” said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, as the New York Times reported. “That changes today.” Whether it takes responsibility or not, the company faces a hard reckoning. Its goal, according to its Web site: “to achieve its dream of ‘a society with zero fatalities from traffic accidents’ by improving automotive safety systems.” Unfortunately, Takata’s greatest obstacle in achieving this goal may be itself.	65	"[{""start"": 148, ""end"": 457, ""text"": ""And, in the case of one storied Japanese firm that had the guts to go for glory in an untested market — air bags — about 30 years ago, the advice has proved disastrous.

AUTO INDUSTRY Eighth death in U.S. with link to air bags A teen driver who died a few days after a July car crash near Pittsburgh has been tentatively identified as the eighth death in the nation due to an explosive air-bag inflator made by Takata, federal transportation officials said Wednesday. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials also announced an expansion in the recall of vehicles with Takata air bags, the largest and most complex recall in its history. NHTSA learned of the latest death last week after a lawyer for the teen’s family contacted the agency, NHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge told reporters. The car involved was a 2001 Honda Accord under recall. “The agency has now tentatively concluded that this was likely a rupture-related fatality,” Trowbridge said. A death also occurred outside the United States, bringing the global total of fatalities to nine. Dozens of people have been injured by the Takata inflators, which can explode with too much force, sending shrapnel into drivers and passengers. In the United States, about 23 million Takata air-bag inflators have been recalled on 19 million vehicles. Crash testing among those recalled resulted in five passenger side air-bag inflator ruptures, Trowbridge said. As a result, NHTSA is expanding the number of recalled vehicles to include other model years of the five vehicles involved in the tests, he said. Trowbridge said it would amount to several hundred thousand vehicles. Those vehicles are Mazda 6 model years 2005-2008, Honda CRV years 2002-2004, Subaru Legacy years 2005-2008 and Subaru Outback years 2005-2008. — Associated Press TECHNOLOGY Apple shareholders get nominating rights Apple on Tuesday became the latest U.S. company to amend its bylaws to allow long-term shareholders to nominate members to its board.

MONETARY POLICY Head of Minneapolis Fed stepping down Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said Friday that he will step down when his term ends in early 2016, marking the departure of one of the Fed’s leading proponents of easier credit conditions to battle unemployment. Kocherlakota said he has informed the regional bank’s board of directors that he would not seek another term when his current one ends Feb. 29, 2016. Currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Kocherlakota cast the lone dissenting vote at the Fed’s last meeting in October. He argued against ending the Fed’s bond-buying program and urged the central bank to make a commitment to achieving its inflation target before starting to raise interest rates. Before his appointment as head of the Minneapolis bank in October 2009, Kocherlakota had served as an economist on the research staff at the Minneapolis Fed. Prior to that, he was a professor and chairman of the economics department at the University of Minnesota. Two other top Fed officials, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, have announced they will step down from their posts in the spring of 2015. — Associated Press AUTO INDUSTRY Chrysler expanding recall over air bags Chrysler Group is expanding its U.S. recall of older-model vehicles with Takata passenger-side air bags, adding a second ­inflator design to the recall and extending it to more regions. Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said in a statement late Thursday that it was recalling 208,783 vehicles by adding the second inflator family and including five more states and three territories. The company said no accidents or injuries in any of its vehicles have been linked to any Takata passenger-side inflators. Chrysler was one of 10 automakers that began a regional recall in June of older-model vehicles equipped with both driver- and passenger-side Takata air bags in areas with high humidity. Including a recent passenger-side air bag recall involving a single pickup truck model and a different Takata inflator design, the total number of affected vehicles is estimated at 617,573, Chrysler said. “Chrysler Group has not identified an inflator defect in any of its vehicles,” the company said. “However, the company is committed — out of an abundance of caution — to replacing these components.” On Dec. 3, Chrysler recalled 2003 Ram pickup trucks with passenger-side bags using inflators from a product family code-named “SPI.” Thursday’s recall covers inflators from the “PSPI” family of Takata inflators, Chrysler said. The recall affects 2003 to 2005 models of Dodge and Chrysler cars, pickup trucks and SUVs. The latest expansion adds Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, American Samoa, Guam and Saipan to a list that initially was made up of Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. — Reuters Also in Business ● A French court ruled that Uber’s ride-hailing service may infringe French law and ordered the company to make changes to its popular mobile-app-based service.

The public outcry over the recent massive recall of potentially dangerous airbags — this one affecting as many as 4.7 million vehicles — is just another reminder that the humble car airbag still has a ways to go before it reliably offers the type of safety protection that Americans have a right to demand. Ever since the first car airbag appeared at the beginning of the 1970s, there have been numerous iterations on the basic design — a giant bag of air that rapidly deploys upon impact — but we simply have not come far enough, fast enough in 40 years. While it seems as though we are caught in a seemingly endless cycle of incremental innovation for the humble car airbag, there are some out-of-the-box ideas out there. One idea is to supplement airbags inside cars with airbags outside cars in order to protect innocent bystanders. In 2012, for example, Volvo created the world’s first “external” pedestrian airbag for the V40. The aim was to have an airbag that would deploy to prevent pedestrians from being sideswiped by vehicles. Another idea is to specifically target parts of the human body with airbags that are smaller and deploy with less energy — and thus, avoid some of the problems posed by the Takata airbags involved in the recall. The general idea is to create airbags specifically contoured to parts of the human body. Fifteen years ago, for example, knee airbags were developed to prevent knees from being crushed upon impact with the dashboard. And, back in 2009, Ford Motor Company pioneered “inflatable seat belts” as a way to cushion impact, using a hybrid seat belt-airbag approach to automobile safety. But the real potential for disruptive innovation in today’s airbag industry is in “pre-crash” airbags that work in concert with sensors and cameras on the vehicle. This would help to reduce one of the most common problems — airbags that deploy upon impact with too much force. Without any advance warning of a crash, airbags must generate enormous force in order to work, and that’s what leads to all sorts of safety problems. In short, it’s like “getting hit in the face with a boxing glove.” With sensors, though, airbags would be able to deploy in advance — and those precious milliseconds might be enough to reduce serious injuries. Automakers such as Audi and Lexus are now working on “pre-crash” and “pre-collision” systems that include radar sensors and active cameras. If you push hard enough on the concept of sensors and cameras being used to create a “pre-crash” system, you get the self-driving car. That’s where things get really interesting. If you consider that 90 percent of all accidents are caused by driver error and that 40 percent of those accidents can be linked to driver fatigue, alcohol, drugs or other distractions, it’s clear that cars without beer-drinking, texting human drivers — or, at least, cars with enough sensors to detect traffic in front of and in back of them — could have a significant impact on reducing the risk of being involved in a serious car accident. In 2012, a report from KPMG and the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Michigan suggested that the coming era of self-driving vehicles would have a huge number of consequences for automobile safety. They might even change how we build cars. For example, as Professor Raj Rajkumar of Carnegie Mellon University, who is the co-director of the Carnegie Mellon self-driving car project, told me in a phone conversation, self-driving cars would not need to include as much reinforced steel for safety reasons, making them lighter and less dangerous. And that’s not all. Self-driving cars, if they ever become mainstream, would radically change the car driving experience. There would be fewer traffic jams, fewer traffic lights and less need for road signs. If cars travel together in packs, all traveling at the same speed, as KPMG and CAR suggest, wouldn’t that mean more “fender benders” and less serious types of collisions? You wouldn’t have a mix of aggressive and conservative drivers on the road, you’d have cars all going at about the same speed. As Rajkumar told me, “Speeds would be harmonized and that would help to avoid accidents and traffic jams.” And, who’s to say that the standard car configuration — a driver and passenger in front, more passengers in back — is even the optimal configuration from a safety perspective? As Rajkumar suggested, “We could see different layouts. The seating could be adaptable, the seats could be turned into more of a roundtable, or the back seat could become a bed.” That would seem to argue for a different approach to airbags that challenges the conventional approach based on frontal airbags for drivers. If cars start to look more like other forms of mass transportation, that begs the obvious question: What other forms of mass transportation have airbags? The important point is that new innovations in car safety made possible by sensors, radars, lasers and onboard computers could also lead to radically new types of car experiences. And that could lead to a radical re-rethinking of the humble car airbag. If you break it down, the idea of an exploding bag of air to protect drivers is really just a high-tech version of surrounding yourself with pillows. We have a choice: Do we just create a more efficient airbag or do we break open the category entirely and create a new auto safety paradigm in the process? Once the cost of installing sensors in self-driving cars comes down even further, we might see the beginning of the end of the humble car airbag.	62	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 306, ""text"": ""lic outcry over the recent massive recall of potentially dangerous airbags — this one affecting as many as 4.7 million vehicles — is just another reminder that the humble car airbag still has a ways to go before it reliably offers the type of safety protection that Americans have a right to demand."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1039, ""end"": 1250, ""text"": ""Another idea is to specifically target parts of the human body with airbags that are smaller and deploy with less energy — and thus, avoid some of the problems posed by the Takata airbags involved in the recall."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1039, ""end"": 1159, ""text"": ""Another idea is to specifically target parts of the human body with airbags that are smaller and deploy with less energy"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	73	2023-03-17T10:28:19.145905Z	2023-03-17T10:28:19.146036Z	693.184
Federal safety officials are calling for a massive national recall of automobiles built with a potentially explosive air bag, a move that may affect an estimated 30 million vehicles in the United States. The announcement regarding driver’s-side air bags could lead to one of the nation’s largest-ever automobile recalls, and possibly overwhelm manufacturers’ ability to replace the air bag systems. The devices are made by a Japanese firm, Takata, and used by at least 10 automakers — BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “We now know that millions of vehicles must be recalled to address defective Takata air bags, and our aggressive investigation is far from over,” NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman said in a statement. “We’re pushing Takata and all affected manufacturers to issue the recall and to ensure the recalls capture the full scope of the problems.” A previous recall had been more limited, involving only about 8 million vehicles in more humid areas, where the problem had seemed most prevalent. The exploding air bags can blast shrapnel into drivers or passengers. But even the more limited recall seemed to stretch automakers’ abilities to do the repairs, in part because the replacement air bags are in short supply. Honda said it did not have enough parts to immediately fix the more than 5 million Accords, Civics and other vehicles with defective air bags. Toyota, meanwhile, said it was instructing its dealerships to disable air bags and warn against riding in the passenger seat. The speed of the recall could depend on Takata. “It’s going to be a long slog,” said John O’Dell, an analyst at Edmunds.com, the automotive Web site. “Takata has to step up to the plate and get them product. One can’t fault the automakers for not having what the suppliers haven’t supplied.” NHTSA officials nevertheless signaled their determination to broaden the fix, though they have not yet pinpointed which models and years will be involved. If Takata and the manufacturers do not quickly agree to the recall, the officials said in the announcement Tuesday, the agency “will use the full extent of its statutory powers to ensure vehicles that use the same or similar air bag inflator are recalled.” The announcement appears to represent a significant turnabout by the agency, which had previously defended the more limited recall. Regulators had said a broader nationwide recall would divert a limited supply of replacement air bags “from those at demonstrated risk” in areas with long-term humidity and heat. But that position drew stern criticism from Capitol Hill. In a letter to NHTSA last month, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said they were “increasingly troubled and alarmed” by regulators’ public guidance. They also criticized the “arbitrary geographic boundaries” of automakers’ “puzzling and inconsistent” recall. For example, while Subaru and BMW had announced nationwide recalls for Takata air bags, Honda at the time had issued a more limited recall. At the time, Markey’s office put the number of affected vehicles at 30 million, an estimate based on auto registration and other federal transportation data. Blumenthal and Markey said they were pleased by NHTSA’s decision Tuesday, and added that the recall should include both driver’s-side and passenger-side air bags. “NHTSA today acknowledged that the danger presented by Takata air bags is not limited to any one part of the country,” Blumenthal and Markey said in a statement. “Three of the four known deaths that have occurred from these deadly air bags happened outside of the regional recall boundaries, which proves that this haphazard geographic safety regime doesn’t work,” Markey said separately. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement that “by demanding this national recall, NHTSA has demonstrated once again that it will follow data and evidence to protect the lives of Americans on the road and to hold manufacturers accountable.” Although the rate of reported incidents is low, the air bags have been linked to four deaths and more than 100 injuries so far. In recent days, Takata has conceded that it changed the chemical mix of its propellant in newly designed air bag inflators, according to NHTSA. The agency said it will investigate whether the new chemical composition of Takata’s propellant mix may be a contributing factor in the air bag inflator ruptures. It has asked the company to provide, under oath, documents and detailed information on the propellant used in Takata’s inflators. Company and government officials are due to face Congress in a hearing Thursday.	61	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 203, ""text"": ""l safety officials are calling for a massive national recall of automobiles built with a potentially explosive air bag, a move that may affect an estimated 30 million vehicles in the United States."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 575, ""end"": 785, ""text"": ""according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “We now know that millions of vehicles must be recalled to address defective Takata air bags, and our aggressive investigation is far from over,”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 850, ""end"": 988, ""text"": ""We’re pushing Takata and all affected manufacturers to issue the recall and to ensure the recalls capture the full scope of the problems.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1136, ""end"": 1204, ""text"": ""The exploding air bags can blast shrapnel into drivers or passengers"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2994, ""end"": 3080, ""text"": ""For example, while Subaru and BMW had announced nationwide recalls for Takata air bags"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3486, ""end"": 3573, ""text"": ""he danger presented by Takata air bags is not limited to any one part of the country,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4149, ""end"": 4231, ""text"": ""he air bags have been linked to four deaths and more than 100 injuries so far.

AUTOMOTIVE Japan’s Big 3 widen global air-bag recall Japan’s three biggest automakers are expanding a huge global recall triggered by potentially fatal air bags made by Takata, saying Wednesday that they will take back millions of vehicles worldwide for investigation. Toyota and Nissan said they are recalling about 6.5 million vehicles globally, while Honda said it would follow suit, without giving details. A U.S. Honda spokesman added, however, that any potential action would not affect automobiles that were sold in the United States. Wednesday’s announcements raise to about 31 million the number of vehicles recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata air-bag inflaters, which can erupt with too much force, spraying shrapnel inside the car. The Takata-linked recalls top the largest U.S. recall of 21 million vehicles by Ford Motor in the 1980s for a parking gear problem, according to U.S. safety regulators and safety advocates. General Motors recalled about 30 million vehicles last year, but those were for a range of defects, including faulty ignition switches. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said Toyota and Nissan, as well as Japanese government officials, have been in contact with the U.S. safety agency over the past few days, and NHTSA will soon announce “significant new steps” related to accelerating Takata recalls. Six deaths have been linked to the defective Takata air bags, all on cars made by Honda, which announced disappointing profit forecasts last month, citing high quality-related costs. — Reuters TRANSPORTATION Plouffe shifts jobs at Uber, joins board Uber Technologies said David Plouffe, head of communications for the mobile car-hailing application, is shifting to an advisory role and joining the company’s board.

"Look at your six closest neighbors: If all of you have a car, there's a good chance one of you is driving behind a dangerously faulty Takata air bag. Nearly 34 million cars and trucks (out of the about 250 million on American roads) were just called defective amid the biggest consumer recall in U.S. history. The air bags hide a nasty flaw that has been linked to six deaths and more than 100 injuries. A chemical inside the bag can burn too hot, causing it to burst and blast out metal shards. The defect is made worse in humid climates with lots of moisture in the air. As you might have noticed, summer is coming, so the problem's not exactly going to go away on its own. The air bags pose a huge danger, but for the vast majority of drivers, the recall process may be marked by much more commonplace headaches. It's a confusing process, after all: Is your car at risk? If so, what do you do? And when can you expect repairs? We put together a quick how-to guide to help you know what to expect just in case you're one of those drivers. [Flawed Takata air bags in 34 million vehicles lead to biggest recall in history] The first step First, get your vehicle's identification number, or VIN. It's a 17-digit code you can find on the driver's side of your dashboard, by looking in from the outside of the windshield. Type that unique code into www.safercar.gov/vin. That's the Department of Transportation's database for cars that have been recalled but not repaired over the last 15 years. (Many automakers run their own, too: www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Owners/vin-lookup-sites.) If your car has been recalled, contact your local dealership to schedule your replacement appointment. It's free: The fix is on the company's dime. You should also ask your dealer or carmaker for a free ""loaner"" car while the car's in the shop. Easy so far, right? Here's where it gets tricky It's going to take a few days, maybe even a few weeks, for carmakers to say exactly which cars and trucks need to be included in the Takata recall. You should keep checking on that VIN lookup over time just in case your vehicle gets added later on. We have some idea which car companies are touched by the recall: Cars from BMW, Dodge, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and a few others, generally made between 2000 and 2008, have already been recalled. But that list only includes half of the recalled vehicles. In essence, everyone should be checking. Car owners (as decided by your registration) are also sent first-class letters telling them of the recall. But you'd be surprised how many throw them out, thinking they're a piece of spam or not important. About 30 percent of the drivers notified in a traditional recall don't respond at all. (Don't be one of them.) [How to know if your car is part of the biggest recall in history] The waiting game Takata is doing a ""rolling recall,"" sending notices to the drivers they think are in the most urgent trouble spots: Humid areas with high moisture, which make the rupture problem worse. (Southerners, Gulf Coasters: This means you.) If you got a notice already, you should call your dealer as soon as possible. ""The sooner you contact your dealer, the sooner you'll get on the list for repairs,"" said Jack Gillis, a consumer advocate with the Consumer Federation of America. But there's no guarantee the dealer will be ready to fix your car then and there. In fact, it could take years for carmakers to get all the parts they need. Some carmakers are signing deals with other suppliers besides Takata for replacement parts. That means you may have to wait. Federal regulators say, yes, that means you may still be driving a defective car for months. But no, they caution, don't disable or tamper with the air bag. Those things still save about 2,400 lives a year, federal safety data show. ""There is a frustration factor. ... If parts are not immediately available, people will say, 'If it were that serious, they'd tell me to park it,'"" Clarence Ditlow, an executive director for the Center for Auto Safety, said last year. ""Once you miss the initial opportunity, you're going to lose people."" [Defective air bags raise questions about automakers’ ability to handle gigantic recall] Recall fatigue It's easy to see why many drivers never hear about recalls or ignore them outright. More than 50 million cars and trucks were recalled across the country last year: That's more than three times as many vehicles were even sold nationwide the year before. Those recalls were spread out over what amounted to about two recall campaigns a day. The notices carmakers send out have been criticized for softening the dangers. Then, of course, come the horror stories of driving scares and dealership frustrations, which can prompt many drivers not to bother. John Kauffman Jr., a Maryland driver whose 2011 Chrysler 300 began filling up with smoke last year while on the highway, learned that the car had been recalled due to faulty alternators. His local dealership told him to tow it in, but after replacing the part, technicians said the recall wasn't official yet and tried to charge him $1,041 for the repair. (The company later said it would reimburse owners who paid for repairs.) These things are concerning not just because they make the driver less safe. They also make it less safe for buyers down the road, who may buy the car later off Craigslist or a used-car lot. Carfax said about 3.5 million cars and trucks were listed for sale in 2013, even though they'd been recalled. That makes it harder for automakers to find the new drivers and alert them to problems. (Some carmakers, like Honda, pay for investigative teams to track down hard-to-reach drivers.) ""There's automotive recall fatigue,"" Mike Rozembajgier, a vice president of recall consultant firm Stericycle, said last year. ""People begin to think, 'I already checked,' or 'That's not my car,' or 'That's not that serious.' But they're all serious. They all have safety implications."" [It’s the worst year ever for auto recalls. Why are so many dangerous cars still on the road?] The other problem Even after months of investigations from government, industry and independent researchers, no one knows exactly what to blame for the defect. Takata has pointed to separate flaws in different types of vehicles, and regulators generally have an idea of what makes the problem worse, but we're all still confused at what exactly is the root cause. That means all those replacement parts may, yes, have the same problem. A very disconcerting end to this whole process, I know. But that still shouldn't prevent you from following through. Federal officials launched a Web site, www.SaferCar.gov/RecallsSpotlight, that they say will keep posting updates. You can also sign up for email alerts for new recalls, based on your car's make and model: http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/subscriptions/.

"It's becoming the year of the recall: Automakers have recalled more than 28 million vehicles in the United States this year--more than one in 10 vehicles on the road -- putting the industry on track to trample the 2004 record of 30.8 million. Just on Monday, Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan recalled close to 3 million vehicles worldwide to repair an air bag problem. Coupled with a recent Toyota recall to fix a similar problem, it means that in just the past month Japan's three largest automakers have called back more than 5 million vehicles worldwide to fix faulty air bags. It's unclear how many of those vehicles are in the United States. Industry analysts see two big factors behind the flood of recalls: Automakers everywhere are being extra careful after seeing Toyota get slapped by a $1.2 billion fine earlier this year to settle charges that it hid safety problems from customers and regulators. And, of course, there's the debacle confronting General Motors, which is facing multiple investigations for taking more than a decade to recall cars equipped with a defective ignition switch linked to at least 13 deaths. In February, GM started recalling 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars equipped with defective ignition switches. But that was just the beginning. So far this year, GM has ordered 44 recalls covering 17.7 million vehicles in the United States and more than 20 million in North America, the automaker said. The U.S. recalls account for nearly two-thirds of all recalls in the country this year. ""Almost all automakers are doing a large number of recalls,"" said Arthur C. Wheaton, an automobile industry specialist at The Worker Institute at Cornell University. Many of the defects have been serious: faulty ignition switches, overheating exhaust parts, power steering problems. But others, not so much: Earlier this month, GM recalled 184 Chevrolet and GMC trucks that were equipped with floor mats prone to move under the driver's feet because the vinyl floors have no attachments to secure them in place. GM also recalled more than 57,000 trucks whose chimes did not work if a key was in the ignition while a driver's door is open, or a front seat belt is not buckled. The cost of recalls can put a financial strain automakers. GM estimates that its recalls will take $2 billion off its bottom line this year. But for automakers and dealers, there is also an upside. Analysts say that at least two in three recall notices is fulfilled, meaning that dealers get to have their old customers back in the showroom. There, they can show off the new models, and, at minimum, be in a position to sell drivers on some repairs they previously were not considering. ""The recalls, per se, are not bad,"" Wheaton said. ""The thing is how you handle them, and are you, as an automaker, seen as trying to hide something. If done right, they can help dealers and automakers. Dealers get traffic in the showrooms, and automakers get to show they are being aggressive and concerned about fixing problems."" While the huge number of recalls this year is an anomaly, people who follow the industry say car owners should expect to see a healthy number of recall notices in their mailboxes going forward. As cars become equipped with more computer and other electronic components, the chances of defects increase. Also, Wheaton noted, more autos than ever share parts, meaning that if one part is bad, more vehicles will have to be recalled to fix the problem."	57	"[{""start"": 243, ""end"": 372, ""text"": ""Just on Monday, Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan recalled close to 3 million vehicles worldwide to repair an air bag problem."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3037, ""end"": 3230, ""text"": ""While the huge number of recalls this year is an anomaly, people who follow the industry say car owners should expect to see a healthy number of recall notices in their mailboxes going forward."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3095, ""end"": 3196, ""text"": ""people who follow the industry say car owners should expect to see a healthy number of recall notices"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	69	2023-03-16T23:37:25.420469Z	2023-03-16T23:37:25.420575Z	242.768
THE NATIONAL Highway Transportation Safety Administration is widening its crackdown on air bags at risk of exploding — potentially killing or maiming the people they are supposed to protect. This is another case in which it has taken years for the government and car companies to come to grips with the full scale of a deadly automotive defect, demonstrating again that the nation’s vehicle safety monitors aren’t doing a good enough job. Takata is one of a few firms worldwide that manufacture air bags. The devices are supposed to deploy with enough force to provide protection in milliseconds, preventing dangerous impacts with other parts of a car. The bags at issue appear prone to deploy too violently, creating metal shards and propelling them toward people in the car. The problem has been linked to four U.S. deaths and many injuries — including those of Stephanie Erdman, who testified before a Senate panel on Thursday that she was blinded in one eye after her Honda air bag deployed. Takata air-bag recalls have been going on since 2008, but evidence of the problem began emerging long before that. The company admitted last week that Honda sent it photos of a burst air bag in 2005 that it failed to investigate. Since then, the scale of the problem has grown alarmingly. Air bags in humid places seem to be more at risk, suggesting some interaction between chemicals used to deploy air bags and moisture. Recalls first focused on 8 million cars in humid climates. Last week the NHTSA began to push for a nationwide recall affecting perhaps 30 million cars. That’s the right call, and it should have happened sooner. Cars can be driven in and out of humid regions. All owners deserve notice that they might have a defective air bag that should be replaced. But Takata can produce only 300,000 replacement kits a month. Shouldn’t scarce kits go where they’re needed most? Not a problem, say industry critics, because even if a national recall is declared, replacement kits should still be prioritized for places where the risk is highest. The bigger question is whether carmakers and the NHTSA are effectively monitoring and responding to aftermarket problems. This year it emerged that General Motors failed for years to fix faulty ignition switches in some cars. Now it seems that millions of Americans have been driving for years with dangerous air bags. Part of the problem appears to be what car companies have — or haven’t — been telling the NHTSA, and part of it is that the NHTSA doesn’t always pick up on significant problems in their early stages. Democrats and Republicans in Congress are looking for ways to improve the system. Meanwhile, there is at least one thing that already makes sense for them to pass: A bill that would reduce the routine secrecy surrounding court settlements in lawsuits concerning public safety or public health. There were air-bag-related proceedings as early as 2003. With more information on the public record, those in and outside of government would have a better chance of connecting the dots sooner.

Nearly 34 million cars and trucks nationwide were declared defective Tuesday because of deadly air bags made by auto-parts giant Takata, in what is expected to be the biggest recall of any consumer product in U.S. history. The expanded recall doubled the number of vehicles believed to have the air bags, which can blast out sharp metal shrapnel when deployed, a flaw that has been linked to six deaths and more than 100 injuries. The nationwide recall effort is expected to be a logistical nightmare for the auto industry, costing billions of dollars and potentially overwhelming automakers, parts suppliers and dealerships already struggling to find enough safe replacement parts. It could be days before vehicle owners hear from automakers about whether their models are covered by the recall, officials said, and analysts expect that it could take years for all the defective cars to get the needed repairs. In the meantime, millions who drive some of the most popular models from BMW, Ford, Honda, Toyota and other carmakers could remain behind the wheel with a defect that lawmakers have deemed a “public safety threat.” [READ: Is your car part of the recall?] “How long is this going to take? Nobody knows that yet,” National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Mark Rosekind said Tuesday, referring to the recall process. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx added that it was “probably the most complex consumer safety recall in U.S. history.” The Takata recall eclipses General Motors’ recall of 30 million vehicles last year for faulty ignition switches and other problems. It also surpassed the biggest previous consumer recall, in 1982, of 31 million bottles of Tylenol amid a poison scare. Federal officials said years of humid weather, along with other factors, could cause the propellant in driver- and passenger-side air-bag inflaters to burn hotter than it should, leading to shard-blasting ruptures that Takata blamed on “over-aggressive combustion.” But an investigation by Takata, automakers and independent researchers has yet to point to a definitive cause behind the ruptures, leading safety advocates to worry that replacement parts could have the same fatal flaw. Takata, a Tokyo-based parts manufacturer, supplied an estimated 30 percent of the world’s air bags to several global automakers, and its defective parts have been found in dozens of car and truck models made since 2000. Federal officials said they did not yet know exactly which makes and models were covered in the recall. Nearly a dozen automakers, including Honda, Toyota and Ford, have already recalled 17 million potentially defective vehicles across the United States and more than 36 million worldwide. But Takata bitterly resisted an expanded recall for months, opting to limit the effort to humid regions where high moisture levels worsened the defect. Early recalls, Takata said, will target older cars in more humid climates before expanding across the country. The expanded recall is a victory for NHTSA, which fought with Takata for months and was criticized by lawmakers last year for its public guidance amid the regional recall. Foxx called it “a major step forward for public safety,” adding: “We will not stop our work until every air bag is replaced.” “It’s a huge, huge recall, and it’s really a relief to know that this has now been resolved,” said Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA head. “This is such a dangerous system that I don’t think anyone is going to hesitate to bring their car in to get it fixed.” Shigehisa Takada, Takata’s chairman and chief executive, said Tuesday that the company “was pleased to have reached this agreement with NHTSA, which presents a clear path forward to advancing safety and restoring the trust of automakers and the driving public.” In February, NHTSA began fining Takata $14,000 a day for failing to cooperate with its investigation. That fine, which has reached about $1.2 million, was suspended Tuesday following the expanded recall. Some lawmakers celebrated the recall as a step toward safer roads. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), a persistent Takata critic, said, “Folks shouldn’t have to drive around wondering if their air bag is going to explode in their face.” But others worried that more questions needed to be answered. In a statement, Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) and Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) urged Takata and NHTSA to intensify their investigation, adding that they were concerned that “the root cause of these deadly deployments is still unknown.” Replacing the defective parts could be a worldwide challenge. Takata, which runs 56 plants in 20 countries and employs 36,000 workers worldwide, has said it could make millions of new air bags a year, but not tens of millions. Automakers such as Honda, believed to be the worst affected, have signed deals with other suppliers and manufacturers, including Autoliv and TRW Automotive, for replacement parts. Even so, some automakers were telling drivers that it could be months before their cars are repaired. “A recall of this scope illustrates the potential for massive automaker expense and consumer inconvenience when a common, mass-produced part is defective,” said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “Ironically, the use of common parts across markets and manufacturers is meant to save money, yet a recall of this size will cost the industry billions.” On top of its standard first-class recall mailers and more than 1 million phone calls to owners, Honda has told its dealerships to check vehicles’ identification numbers during every visit and to offer free rental cars during repairs, Bruce Smith, American Honda Motor’s senior vice president, said last month at a NHTSA recall workshop. Honda workers have been scouring salvage yards, collecting more than 20,000 defective inflaters to prevent them from being used in repairs, Smith said. The carmaker has also enlisted an investigative firm in hopes of finding hard-to-reach owners of older vehicles with the recalled part. The Justice Department is investigating Takata, and numerous lawsuits have slammed the parts maker’s handling of the recall. Orlando lawyer Richard New­some represents seven clients who say they were injured by Takata air bags. One Florida man, Corey Burdick, said he was blinded in one eye last year after the air bag in his 2001 Honda Civic deployed, sending a metal projectile into his face. “We still don’t know how this is happening,” Newsome said. “Are the replacement air bags going to have the same problem?” More than 50 million cars and trucks were recalled in 2014 in the worst year for recalls in U.S. history, with 1 in 5 vehicles on the road said to be at risk of critical defects. Drivers can find out whether their cars are included in a recall by visiting vinrcl.safercar.gov/vin. Federal officials have also launched a “recalls spotlight” section of Safercar.gov to provide updates. Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, said the millions of vehicle owners who have already received recall notices should set up appointments with their dealerships soon, since ­automakers believe they’re at greatest risk. “No matter how you look at it, it’s going to be a mess,” Ditlow said. “The real question: Is this recall going to be big enough?” Todd C. Frankel contributed to this report.	55	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 136, ""text"": ""y 34 million cars and trucks nationwide were declared defective Tuesday because of deadly air bags made by auto-parts giant Takata,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 223, ""end"": 429, ""text"": ""he expanded recall doubled the number of vehicles believed to have the air bags, which can blast out sharp metal shrapnel when deployed, a flaw that has been linked to six deaths and more than 100 injuries"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 929, ""end"": 1126, ""text"": ""millions who drive some of the most popular models from BMW, Ford, Honda, Toyota and other carmakers could remain behind the wheel with a defect that lawmakers have deemed a “public safety threat."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1713, ""end"": 1978, ""text"": ""eral officials said years of humid weather, along with other factors, could cause the propellant in driver- and passenger-side air-bag inflaters to burn hotter than it should, leading to shard-blasting ruptures that Takata blamed on “over-aggressive combustion."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1986, ""end"": 2198, ""text"": ""investigation by Takata, automakers and independent researchers has yet to point to a definitive cause behind the ruptures, leading safety advocates to worry that replacement parts could have the same fatal flaw."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2332, ""end"": 2417, ""text"": ""its defective parts have been found in dozens of car and truck models made since 2000"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4461, ""end"": 4521, ""text"": ""“the root cause of these deadly deployments is still unknown"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3144, ""end"": 3269, ""text"": ""Foxx called it “a major step forward for public safety,” adding: “We will not stop our work until every air bag is replaced.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3144, ""end"": 3200, ""text"": ""Foxx called it “a major step forward for public safety,”"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 6150, ""end"": 6251, ""text"": ""Orlando lawyer Richard New­some represents seven clients who say they were injured by Takata air bags"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6253, ""end"": 6418, ""text"": ""One Florida man, Corey Burdick, said he was blinded in one eye last year after the air bag in his 2001 Honda Civic deployed, sending a metal projectile into his face"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6421, ""end"": 6541, ""text"": ""We still don’t know how this is happening,” Newsome said. “Are the replacement air bags going to have the same problem?”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6480, ""end"": 6541, ""text"": ""Are the replacement air bags going to have the same problem?”"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	67	2023-03-16T23:28:02.746568Z	2023-03-16T23:28:02.746671Z	661.635
Pressure continued to mount on General Motors late Thursday as a review of federal crash data found that 303 drivers and front-seat passengers died in accidents in which air bags did not inflate in two models that the automaker recalled last month. The review by Friedman Research Corp. was commissioned by the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group. The center has accused GM and federal auto safety regulators of failing to aggressively pursue complaints about faulty ignition switches that caused cars to stall, disabling their air bags even in violent collisions. GM announced last month that it was recalling 1.6 million vehicles to repair the defective part, which the automaker said had played a role in 12 deaths. Previously GM said there were 13 deaths. The review identified fatal accidents recorded in the federal Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database that involved just two of six models recalled by GM, the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion. The center said that if the other recalled models were evaluated, the death toll would certainly be much higher. Researchers did not attempt to assess whether the faulty switches played a part in the air bags’ failure to deploy. In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the center, criticized the agency for not doing more to uncover the ignition flaws and demand a recall. He said the NHTSA missed red flags stretching back more than a decade. “As the agency has done in past investigations, special investigation teams should have been sent out to acquire more information on the crashes found in FARS and determine in which ones the airbag did not deploy due to the ignition key defect.” The review’s findings were first reported by the New York Times. The NHTSA has defended its actions, noting that early on it launched three investigations into the accidents. But the agency said those probes were unable to find the exact cause of the accidents amid a blur of complaints and complicating factors, including the introduction of a new type of air bag around the time of the earliest suspicious crashes. For its part, GM said that the Friedman analysis did not determine why the air bags did not deploy in the fatal accidents. “As knowledgeable observers know, FARS tracks raw data,” GM spokesman Greg A. Martin said in a statement late Thursday. “Without rigorous analysis, it is pure speculation to attempt to draw any meaningful conclusions. In contrast, research is underway at GM and the investigation of the ignition switch recall and the impact of the defective switch is ongoing.” The problem with the ignition switches and the amount of time that passed before a recall was ordered have put the NHTSAand GM in investigators’ crosshairs. Members of both the House and Senate have announced plans to summon GM officials to Capitol Hill for hearings, and a potential criminal investigation is underway at the Justice Department. Meanwhile, newly installed GM chief executive Mary T. Barra has ordered an internal review that is being led by a former federal prosecutor. GM has told federal regulators that reports date back as far as 2001, and federal regulators began looking into reports of problematic switches several years later. But neither party says there was enough evidence to order a recall. It wasn’t until last month that GM ordered a recall, acting after a rigorous investigation conducted for the company by an outside engineer identified the problem, according to a chronology of events GM has filed with federal regulators. The recall letters — which the company said went out this week — cover the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, the 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and the 2007 Saturn Sky.	54	"[{""start"": 105, ""end"": 247, ""text"": ""303 drivers and front-seat passengers died in accidents in which air bags did not inflate in two models that the automaker recalled last month"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 570, ""end"": 722, ""text"": ""GM announced last month that it was recalling 1.6 million vehicles to repair the defective part, which the automaker said had played a role in 12 deaths"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 724, ""end"": 764, ""text"": ""Previously GM said there were 13 deaths."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2165, ""end"": 2287, ""text"": ""For its part, GM said that the Friedman analysis did not determine why the air bags did not deploy in the fatal accidents."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2165, ""end"": 2287, ""text"": ""For its part, GM said that the Friedman analysis did not determine why the air bags did not deploy in the fatal accidents."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 570, ""end"": 665, ""text"": ""GM announced last month that it was recalling 1.6 million vehicles to repair the defective part"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 202, ""end"": 247, ""text"": ""odels that the automaker recalled last month"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	66	2023-03-16T23:16:45.108111Z	2023-03-16T23:16:58.042993Z	451.65999999999997
Though Takata still doesn’t know why its defective air bags killed six drivers, the car-parts giant is continuing to use a chemical that experts have blamed for the deadly defect, the company said Tuesday during a congressional hearing into the biggest auto recall in history. Nearly 34 million cars and trucks, or about 1 in 7 on U.S. roads, have been recalled because Takata air bags can blast shrapnel when deployed and have led to more than 100 injuries. Even after months of testing, Takata says it has no firm answer for what went wrong. The nation’s top auto-safety regulator said drivers should check whether their cars are subject to potential recalls once a week. But National Highway Traffic Safety Administration head Mark Rosekind added it would still take two weeks for automakers to say which cars are affected, and experts say it could take years for all cars to be repaired. Many of the cars now being fixed, Rosekind added, may need to be repaired again because Takata, one of the world’s biggest air-bag makers, is installing temporary fixes in new cars and replacement units while the “root cause” of the problem remains unknown. Lawmakers at the hearing Tuesday, the first since the recall was expanded last month, harshly criticized Takata for months of resisting a recall, sharing few details and shifting the blame. “We’ve got a young lady sitting over your shoulder bearing the scars of a mistake that was made, and we’re still not getting the answers,” said Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), pointing to an audience member injured by a defective air bag. “We’re doing a recall and replacing parts with parts that are still faulty. There’s no excuse for that.” Takata’s executive vice president in North America, Kevin Kennedy, told lawmakers the company had undertaken tens of thousands of tests to find the fatal flaw, saying, “It is unacceptable to us for even one of our products to fail to perform as intended.” Takata blamed most of the ruptures, including those that killed U.S. drivers, on older air bags with faulty “batwing”-shaped wafers, which hold the propellant that helps the air bag inflate on command. The company said it would stop making the batwing inflaters and replace all older parts. But Takata has not stopped using ammonium nitrate, even though Kennedy said the compound was “certainly a factor” in some accidents. Aggravated by years of heat and humidity, the inexpensive propellant can explode, a flaw that former Takata engineers have told lawmakers should have prevented its use in passenger cars. Takata will gradually switch over to a different compound used by competitors, though Kennedy said the firm was using the old one to speed the production of millions of replacement parts. Kennedy said tests have yet to prove the compound was solely at fault, and new air-bag parts will also use a drying agent, called a desiccant, that Takata says is proven to help. But lawmakers still questioned whether the firm was putting costs ahead of driver safety. “The replacement could be as dangerous as the current,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who had held up a defective Takata air bag, punctured with jagged holes. “Why even replace it?” Takata said finding the cause of the air bags’ “over-aggressive combustion” has been complicated because there are 10 configurations of the inflater used in vehicles by a dozen automakers. Takata resisted a broad national recall for months, even as regulators and safety advocates voiced worries over a growing death count, until an announcement was made last month that the company had agreed to an expanded recall. Even so, Kennedy said the move went beyond what “the science” says is necessary. In February, federal regulators began fining Takata $14,000 a day for failing to assist with its investigation, but the fine has been suspended and none of the $1.2 million has been collected, Rosekind said. The agency can still levy future fines. Rosekind said a full plan for recall fixes may not be ready for the public until the fall, leaving tens of millions of defective cars on the road. Safety advocates worried that drawing the process out even further would worsen drivers’ “recall fatigue” in the aftermath of 2014, the biggest year for recalls in U.S. history. One in five of those polled for a recent Autotrader.com survey said they’d never heard of the Takata recall, data from the car-sales site released Tuesday show. The hearing came the same day automakers reported new-car sales were on pace to hit nearly 18 million, making this the busiest year for car lots in a decade. During the hearing, Rosekind pleaded for help for the NHTSA, saying the agency that has helped oversee a growing spate of complicated recalls was understaffed and working off of a budget that had been slashed more than 20 percent over the past decade. “At some point you need people and authority to get the job done,” he said. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) recounted a recent nighttime crash in which his car struck two deer while traveling at 70 mph and his air bag deployed. “I remember thinking, ‘You know, I’m very lucky I didn’t have a defective Takata air bag,’ ” he said. “And then I thought, ‘The safety of your air bag can’t be just a game of luck.’ ”	53	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 276, ""text"": ""h Takata still doesn’t know why its defective air bags killed six drivers, the car-parts giant is continuing to use a chemical that experts have blamed for the deadly defect, the company said Tuesday during a congressional hearing into the biggest auto recall in history."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 277, ""end"": 458, ""text"": ""Nearly 34 million cars and trucks, or about 1 in 7 on U.S. roads, have been recalled because Takata air bags can blast shrapnel when deployed and have led to more than 100 injuries."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 459, ""end"": 543, ""text"": ""Even after months of testing, Takata says it has no firm answer for what went wrong."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 750, ""end"": 891, ""text"": ""it would still take two weeks for automakers to say which cars are affected, and experts say it could take years for all cars to be repaired."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 750, ""end"": 890, ""text"": ""it would still take two weeks for automakers to say which cars are affected, and experts say it could take years for all cars to be repaired"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 892, ""end"": 1149, ""text"": ""Many of the cars now being fixed, Rosekind added, may need to be repaired again because Takata, one of the world’s biggest air-bag makers, is installing temporary fixes in new cars and replacement units while the “root cause” of the problem remains unknown."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1341, ""end"": 1578, ""text"": ""We’ve got a young lady sitting over your shoulder bearing the scars of a mistake that was made, and we’re still not getting the answers,” said Rep.

A Texas teenager has been confirmed as the 10th person to die in the U.S. when the airbag that was supposed to protect her exploded instead, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday. Huma Hanif, 17, who lived in a Houston suburb, died March 31 when the Takata airbag in her 2002 Honda Civic malfunctioned in a collision struck another vehicle from behind at an intersection. NHTSA examined records which showed that the car was first recalled in 2011 but there was no indication that it had been repaired. About 29 million vehicles made by various automakers have been recalled in the U.S. to replace Takata airbag inflators that can spray drivers and passengers with shards of metal. When a vehicle is involved in a collision, sensors ignite a solid wafer of chemical propellant inside the metal canister of the airbag inflator. A chemical reaction creates a gas that inflates the bag within milliseconds, popping it from the steering wheel or dashboard. But if the propellant burns faster than intended, it produces more gas than the vents into the airbag can handle. The metal canister can break into fragments that spray the driver or passengers. Takata is the world’s leading manufacturer of airbags. In addition to the 29 million U.S. recalls, 7 million more vehicles have been recalled worldwide. Prolonged exposure to hot, humid weather is believed to contribute to the Takata malfunctions, although some have occurred in vehicles used elsewhere. NHTSA said the Hanif’s Honda was registered in the gulf coast region of Texas its entire life. NHTSA Communications Director Bryan Thomas urged drivers whose vehicles have been recalled to get them repaired as quickly as possible. But the demand for replacement airbag inflators has far outstripped the supply, and some dealerships are telling customers that it might take months before the repair can been completed. Owners can visit www.safercar.gov to determine whether their vehicle has been recalled.	51	"[{""start"": 2, ""end"": 140, ""text"": ""s teenager has been confirmed as the 10th person to die in the U.S. when the airbag that was supposed to protect her exploded instead,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 208, ""end"": 399, ""text"": ""Huma Hanif, 17, who lived in a Houston suburb, died March 31 when the Takata airbag in her 2002 Honda Civic malfunctioned in a collision struck another vehicle from behind at an intersection."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 531, ""end"": 1175, ""text"": ""About 29 million vehicles made by various automakers have been recalled in the U.S. to replace Takata airbag inflators that can spray drivers and passengers with shards of metal. When a vehicle is involved in a collision, sensors ignite a solid wafer of chemical propellant inside the metal canister of the airbag inflator.

Federal authorities levied a record $70 million fine on Honda Motor Co. on Thursday for its failure to report more than 1,700 deaths and injuries in its vehicles. “Today’s announcement sends a very clear message to the entire industry that manufacturers have responsibility for the complete and timely reporting of this critical safety information,” said Mark Rosekind, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “The actions we are requiring will push Honda to significantly raise the bar on the effectiveness of its . . . reporting program. Our ongoing oversight will ensure compliance and determine if there is cause for additional actions.” Honda has agreed to pay the fine, federal officials said. The punishment signals that recalls and penalties against automakers that set records in 2014 will continue this year. More than 60 million vehicles were recalled last year, nearly double the record set in 2004, and manufacturers faced an unprecedented $126 million in fines. Honda, which blamed the underreporting on “inadvertent data entry or computer programming errors,” faced fines of $7,000 per day per violation, a maximum civil penalty of $35 million for failure to report the deaths and injuries. It was fined another $35 million for failing to report warranty claims to federal regulators. Rosekind said the Department of Transportation would seek to have the maximum fine per violation increased to $300 million. “We need to increase the cap, and only Congress has the ability to do that,” Rosekind said. Honda said the reporting errors were discovered in a third-party audit conducted after the company received a demand from federal regulators for information. “We have resolved this matter and will move forward to build on the important actions Honda has already taken to address our past shortcomings in early warning reporting,” Rick Schostek, Honda’s executive vice president for North America, said in a statement. “We continue to fully cooperate with NHTSA to achieve greater transparency and to further enhance our reporting practices.” Honda acknowledged failing to report 1,729 death and injury incidents in an 11-year period starting in 2003. Carmakers are required to report those incidents to NHTSA to comply with an October 2000 mandate from Congress that they provide “early reporting” related to defects, injuries or deaths in their vehicles. Honda has contended that its “narrow interpretation” of the law led it to disregard third-party reports, such as those from private investigators or police. “Honda and all of the automakers have a responsibility they must live up to — no excuses,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “Last year alone, we issued more fines than in NHTSA’s entire history. These fines reflect the tough stance we will take against those who violate the law and fail to do their part in the mission to keep Americans safe on the road.” Foxx, who called Honda’s failures “egregious,” said he had conferred with the Justice Department on whether further action should be taken. “It is the Justice Department’s determination whether to pursue criminal penalties,” he said. The 1,729 claims that Honda failed to report eclipsed the number it did report — 1,114 — for the same period. The Italian automaker Ferrari was hit with a $3.5 million penalty last year for failure to meet early-warning reporting requirements on three deaths and vehicle defects. Until Thursday, that had been the largest fine levied under the congressional mandate. Honda already has been hit hard by recalls, with close to 10 million vehicles under recall because of defective air bags that can spray drivers and passengers with shrapnel when the devices deploy. At least five people have been killed by the bags, four of them in the United States.	50	"[{""start"": 3532, ""end"": 3815, ""text"": ""Honda already has been hit hard by recalls, with close to 10 million vehicles under recall because of defective air bags that can spray drivers and passengers with shrapnel when the devices deploy.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said Friday that the world’s largest air-bag maker, Takata, will be fined $14,000 a day until it complies with federal demands for more information on air bags that have killed six people and maimed dozens more. “Those air bags can explode with such force that they have grievously injured people and, in a half-dozen cases­, killed them,” Foxx said. “To remove that threat and get to the root cause of this defect, we need Takata’s cooperation, and so far they have not demonstrated it.” The metal inflation canisters on some Takata air bags have been shattered by the propellent they contain, spraying drivers and passengers with shards of metal. More that 22 million vehicles, including about 17 million in the United States, have been recalled by automakers. Only 2 million U.S. vehicles had been repaired as of December. “We’ve pushed hard to get millions of defective Takata air bags off our roads,” said Foxx, who was in Richmond on a bus tour to promote infrastructure investment. The National Highway Traffic Administration “has issued two orders compelling Takata to provide the documents and information we need to fix this problem, and the company has failed to abide by those orders. Takata’s failure to fully cooperate with our investigation is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.” Foxx also asked Congress to require that rental cars and used cars up for sale that are under recall be repaired before they are rented or sold. The most recent death attributed to a Takata air bag, that of Carlos Solis, 35, near Houston last month, came in a used car that was under recall when he bought it, NHTSA said. Although it was first threatened with the fines in November, Takata issued a statement Friday saying it was “surprised and disappointed.” “We strongly disagree with their characterization that we have not been fully cooperating with them,” the statement said. “We have provided the agency with almost 2.5 million pages of documents to date. We have also been meeting regularly with NHTSA engineers on efforts to identify the root cause of the inflator issue.” NHTSA, in a letter sent to the Japanese company Friday, said that “Takata is neither being forthcoming with the information that it is legally obligated to supply, nor is it being cooperative.” “Takata has failed to provide the information we need to properly analyze the 2.4 million documents it has produced,” NHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said in a conference call with reporters. Trowbridge said NHTSA was preparing a preservation order that would require Takata to maintain and provide all of its internal test results. He pointed car owners to the federal Web site safercar.gov, where they can enter their vehicle identification number to see if it has been subject to recall. “If they receive a notice, make an appointment to immediately have that vehicle repaired,” Trowbridge said. Faced with dozens of proposed class-action lawsuits in the United States that also may name many of their automaker customers, Takata has moved cautiously when pressed to identify the cause of the deadly air-bag deployments or acknowledge its fault. Ten auto manufacturers — Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, General Motors, Subaru, Ford, Chrysler, BMW and Nissan — have issued air-bag recalls since the problem emerged more than six years ago. Regulators first thought — and Takata still believes — that the inflator explosions were caused by sustained exposure to humidity and heat. The initial U.S. recalls were in southern regions, where the five U.S. fatalities and most of the injuries occurred. But last year, NHTSA demanded that the recall be nationwide. Takata said Friday that its research “so far, supported our initial view that age and sustained exposure to heat and humidity is a common factor in the small number of inflators that have malfunctioned.” NHTSA believes that the inflator propellant used by Takata, ammonium nitrate, burns faster than intended after exposure to prolonged moisture in the air. A fast burn can cause an explosion of the metal canister that is supposed to contain the explosion.	49	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 254, ""text"": ""ransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said Friday that the world’s largest air-bag maker, Takata, will be fined $14,000 a day until it complies with federal demands for more information on air bags that have killed six people and maimed dozens more."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 256, ""end"": 392, ""text"": ""Those air bags can explode with such force that they have grievously injured people and, in a half-dozen cases­, killed them,” Foxx said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5, ""end"": 253, ""text"": ""ransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said Friday that the world’s largest air-bag maker, Takata, will be fined $14,000 a day until it complies with federal demands for more information on air bags that have killed six people and maimed dozens more"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 532, ""end"": 690, ""text"": ""The metal inflation canisters on some Takata air bags have been shattered by the propellent they contain, spraying drivers and passengers with shards of metal"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 870, ""end"": 959, ""text"": ""We’ve pushed hard to get millions of defective Takata air bags off our roads,” said Foxx,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 870, ""end"": 948, ""text"": ""We’ve pushed hard to get millions of defective Takata air bags off our roads,"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1492, ""end"": 1663, ""text"": ""ost recent death attributed to a Takata air bag, that of Carlos Solis, 35, near Houston last month, came in a used car that was under recall when he bought it, NHTSA said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3047, ""end"": 3169, ""text"": ""Takata has moved cautiously when pressed to identify the cause of the deadly air-bag deployments or acknowledge its fault."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3170, ""end"": 3364, ""text"": ""Ten auto manufacturers — Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, General Motors, Subaru, Ford, Chrysler, BMW and Nissan — have issued air-bag recalls since the problem emerged more than six years ago."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3887, ""end"": 4140, ""text"": ""NHTSA believes that the inflator propellant used by Takata, ammonium nitrate, burns faster than intended after exposure to prolonged moisture in the air.

Federal regulators said Tuesday that fewer cars than first thought will be recalled for faulty air bags. The recall of cars equipped with Takata air bags remains the biggest recall in U.S. history, however, with the figure now set at 23.4 million vehicles that have been recalled. Regulators first thought that 34 million inflators in 30 million vehicles might be subject to recall, but they said Tuesday that they discovered that some vehicles had been counted twice in the initial tally. They said that so far, the faulty bags have been replaced in 4.4 million vehicles. They said data collected from Takata and automakers has been shared with the Department of Justice, which is considering civil or criminal action against Takata, which allegedly knew about problems with the bags without notifying federal officials. At least eight deaths and numerous injuries have been tied to faulty air bags made by Takata, which inflate with so much force that they spray a driver or passengers with metal shards. In addition to a recall issued by Takata, 11 automakers have recalled their vehicles. When a vehicle is involved in a collision, sensors ignite a solid wafer of chemical propellant inside the metal canister of the air-bag inflator. A chemical reaction creates a gas that inflates the air bag within milliseconds, popping it from the steering wheel or dashboard. But if the propellant burns faster than intended, it produces more gas than the vents into the air bag can handle. The metal canister can break into fragments that injure the driver or passengers. Takata makes one in five  air bags worldwide, has 55 factories in 20 countries and is among the world’s largest suppliers of auto parts. But the company hasn’t been able to keep up with the demand for replacement air bags, and its competitors are reluctant to ramp up production unless they get long-term commitments from automakers for their products.	48	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 104, ""text"": ""al regulators said Tuesday that fewer cars than first thought will be recalled for faulty air bags."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 109, ""end"": 196, ""text"": ""call of cars equipped with Takata air bags remains the biggest recall in U.S. history"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 573, ""end"": 821, ""text"": ""They said data collected from Takata and automakers has been shared with the Department of Justice, which is considering civil or criminal action against Takata, which allegedly knew about problems with the bags without notifying federal officials."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 573, ""end"": 672, ""text"": ""They said data collected from Takata and automakers has been shared with the Department of Justice,"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 822, ""end"": 1006, ""text"": ""At least eight deaths and numerous injuries have been tied to faulty air bags made by Takata, which inflate with so much force that they spray a driver or passengers with metal shards."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1093, ""end"": 1237, ""text"": ""When a vehicle is involved in a collision, sensors ignite a solid wafer of chemical propellant inside the metal canister of the air-bag inflator"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1484, ""end"": 1564, ""text"": ""The metal canister can break into fragments that injure the driver or passengers"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	60	2023-03-16T13:36:02.469749Z	2023-03-16T13:36:02.469854Z	260.409
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration put out a recall notice Monday for defective air bags and urged people whose cars are equipped with them to take action immediately. More than 4.7 million vehicles are involved in the recall. At least four people have died when inflator mechanisms ruptured on the air bags, spraying the passengers with metal fragments. NHTSA warned drivers whose cars have been recalled as a result of faulty inflators to take them to the dealer immediately. Safety experts said about 12 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled. The air bags are made by Takata and are in place in some Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan and General Motors models. NHTSA said it was particularly urgent for vehicles owners in Florida, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii to take immediate action. The federal safety agency said car owners uncertain about whether their vehicle is equipped with a Takata airbag can check at www.safercar.gov/. Using the site requires that owners enter their vehicle identification number (VIN). NHTSA said the affected vehicles by manufacturer are: Toyota: 778,177 vehicles potentially affected. 2002-2004 Lexus SC, 2003-2004 Toyota Corolla, 2003-2004 Toyota Corolla Matrix, 2002-2004 Toyota Sequoia, 2003-2004 Toyota Tundra, 2003-2004 Pontiac Vibe Honda: 2,803,214 vehicles potentially affected. 2001-2007 Honda Accord (4 cylinder), 2001-2002 Honda Accord (6 cylinder), 2001-2005 Honda Civic, 2002-2006 Honda CR-V, 2003-2011 Honda Element, 2002-2004 Honda Odyssey, 2003-2007 Honda Pilot, 2006 Honda Ridgeline, 2003-2006 Acura MDX, 2002-2003 Acura TL/CL Nissan: 437,712 vehicles potentially affected. 2001-2003 Nissan Maxima, 2001-2003 Nissan Pathfinder, 2002-2003 Nissan Sentra, 2001- 2003 Infiniti I30/I35, 2002-2003 Infiniti QX4, 2003 Infiniti FX Mazda: 18,050 vehicles potentially affected. 2003-2004 Mazda6, 2004 Mazda RX-8 BMW: 573,935 vehicles potentially affected. 2000-2005 3 Series Sedan, 2000-2006 3 Series Coupe, 2000- 2005 3 Series Sports Wagon, 2000-2006 3 Series Convertible, 2001-2006 M3 Coupe, 2001-2006 M3 Convertible GM: 133,221 vehicles potentially affected. 2002-2003 Buick LeSabre, 2002-2003 Buick Rendezvous, 2002-2003 Cadillac DeVille, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Impala, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 2002-2003 Chevrolet Venture, 2002-2003 GMC Envoy, 2002-2003 GMC Envoy XL, 2002-2003 Oldsmobile Aurora, 2002-2003 Oldsmobile Bravada, 2002-2003 Oldsmobile Silhouette, 2002-2003 Pontiac Bonneville, 2002-2003 Pontiac Montana	47	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 182, ""text"": ""al Highway Traffic Safety Administration put out a recall notice Monday for defective air bags and urged people whose cars are equipped with them to take action immediately"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 243, ""end"": 369, ""text"": ""At least four people have died when inflator mechanisms ruptured on the air bags, spraying the passengers with metal fragments"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 570, ""end"": 687, ""text"": ""The air bags are made by Takata and are in place in some Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan and General Motors models."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	59	2023-03-16T13:31:26.355294Z	2023-03-16T13:31:26.355396Z	96.301
AUTO INDUSTRY 2 million vehicles recalled for air bag fix More than 2 million Toyota, Chrysler and Honda vehicles are being recalled for a second fix for faulty air bags that may inadvertently inflate while the cars are running. The recall includes some Acura MDX, Dodge Viper, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Honda Odyssey, Pontiac Vibe, Toyota Corolla and Toyota Avalon models made from 2002 to 2004. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says all of the vehicles covered in Saturday’s announcement had already been under a recall for the faulty air bags, but the carmakers’ original attempts to fix the defects worked only about 85 percent of the time. The new recall will fully replace the faulty electronic control unit, which is made by TRW Automotive Holdings of Livonia, Mich. In the previous recall, the unit was only partially replaced. The new remedy will be available to all affected vehicles by the end of the year. However, NHTSA is urging consumers with vehicles under the first recall to have the partial unit installed, even if they have to return to the dealer later for the new remedy. — Associated Press CALIFORNIA ‘Suge’ Knight case video under scrutiny Sheriff’s investigators Saturday were reviewing video of an incident in which hip-hop music mogul Marion “Suge” Knight hit two men with his pickup truck, killing one, that may help provide clarity on whether Knight was the victim or attacker in his most serious run-in with the law to date. The video is in “police custody” said Knight’s defense attorney, James Blatt, and he said he would be seeing it on Monday or Tuesday. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Nicole Nishida confirmed that detectives are reviewing the video, but “they have made no such arrangements with the attorney” and did not have plans to show it to him. Meanwhile, Knight remained jailed on suspicion of murder after turning himself in early Friday. He is being held on $2 million bail. Sheriff’s deputies said Knight hit and killed his friend Terry Carter, 55, with his pickup truck Thursday in a Compton fast-food restaurant parking lot, also injuring Cle “Bone” Sloan, 51, an actor and film consultant who was hospitalized and in stable condition late Friday. Blatt said Knight was an innocent victim who accidentally ran over the men as he tried to escape a vicious attack. The incident was the latest in a long line of brushes with death and the law for the 49-year-old founder of Death Row Records. — Associated Press Whitney Houston’s daughter found unresponsive: The daughter of late singer and entertainer Whitney Houston was found unresponsive, face down in a bathtub Saturday and taken to a hospital in the north Atlanta suburbs, police said. Bobbi Kristina Brown was found by her husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend. When police arrived, they gave Brown additional care until she was taken alive to North Fulton Hospital. Whitney Houston was found dead in a hotel bathtub on Feb. 11, 2012, in Beverly Hills. Authorities concluded that Houston accidentally drowned, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors. Police: Airport traveler attacks homeless man: A traveler who remained at Newark Liberty International Airport after missing two flights faced numerous charges Saturday for allegedly beating a homeless man with a chair as the man was sleeping. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told NJ.com that Leonidas Monroy Sandoval of Guatemala began acting erratically after arriving at the airport Thursday and missing his flights. He allegedly beat the unidentified man early Saturday morning and also threw a chair at Port Authority police. The homeless man was hospitalized with “serious injuries.” NASA satellite to gather water data: A NASA satellite lifted off early Saturday with the hope it will transmit data that will help the world do a better job of preparing for floods and droughts. The satellite is on a three-year mission to track the amount of water locked in soil, which may help residents in low-lying regions brace for floods or farmers get ready for drought conditions. The Delta 2 rocket carrying the Soil Moisture Active Passive — or SMAP — satellite was launched shortly before sunrise from Vandenberg Air Force Base on California’s central coast. — From news services	46	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 227, ""text"": ""DUSTRY 2 million vehicles recalled for air bag fix More than 2 million Toyota, Chrysler and Honda vehicles are being recalled for a second fix for faulty air bags that may inadvertently inflate while the cars are running"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 396, ""end"": 657, ""text"": ""ational Highway Traffic Safety Administration says all of the vehicles covered in Saturday’s announcement had already been under a recall for the faulty air bags, but the carmakers’ original attempts to fix the defects worked only about 85 percent of the time."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 940, ""end"": 1106, ""text"": ""NHTSA is urging consumers with vehicles under the first recall to have the partial unit installed, even if they have to return to the dealer later for the new remedy."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 396, ""end"": 502, ""text"": ""ational Highway Traffic Safety Administration says all of the vehicles covered in Saturday’s announcement"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	58	2023-03-16T13:28:44.838346Z	2023-03-16T13:28:44.838432Z	365.067
The manufacturer of automobile air bags that have killed at least five people and maimed scores of others sidestepped on Tuesday the demand for a nationwide recall of tens of millions of vehicles, setting up a confrontation with federal regulators determined to force the company’s hand. In a statement to U.S. regulators, the Japanese company Takata outlined its response to the crisis, but stopped short of complying with a demand by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA wants regional recalls expanded to include all U.S. vehicles equipped with air-bag inflators that have sprayed drivers with shrapnel when deployed. NHTSA Deputy Administrator David J. Friedman, in testimony prepared for a House committee hearing Wednesday, reiterates his intent to force what is mushrooming into one of the largest vehicle recalls in history. He has threatened to seek a $7,000-per-vehicle fine against Takata. At the hearing, members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce are expected to confront Hiroshi Shimizu, a Takata senior vice president, with the suspicion that his company has replaced air-bag inflators in more than 8 million vehicles with devices no better than the ones being recalled. “Takata has not disclosed whether it has made any changes to the design specifications or manufacturing processes for the replacement inflators,” says a memo prepared for the hearing by the committee’s staff. “In discussions with staff, most vehicle manufacturers indicated that they were replacing the inflators with ‘like’ parts, indicating that it was the same inflator with the same propellant presumably manufactured the same way but of a newer vintage.” A committee staff member familiar with the memo said, “Our members are hoping to gain a better understanding at [Wednesday’s] hearing of what is different and what improvements, if any, have been made in the manufacturing process.” Takata did not respond Tuesday when asked to comment on the suggestion that the replacement parts might not be better than the recalled ones. On Tuesday, Toyota, which has recalled 878,000 vehicles in the United States, called for independent testing of Takata air-bag inflators. In prepared testimony, Abbas Saadat, a Toyota vice president, explains his company’s position: “Like you, we want additional assurances about the integrity and quality of Takata’s manufacturing processes, particularly in light of previous experiences.” Toyota is one of 10 automakers involved in air-bag recalls in the past six years, along with Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, General Motors, Subaru, Ford, Chrysler, BMW and Nissan. Takata has been testing its inflators to find the cause of defects first identified in 2008. The company, which supplies one in five air bags worldwide, has identified production mistakes in one of its U.S. plants and exposure to high humidity as likely causes. “Based on the data currently available and our best engineering judgment, Takata continues to believe that the public safety is best served if the identified areas of high absolute humidity remain the priority for the replacement of suspect inflators,” Shimizu says in testimony prepared for Wednesday’s hearing. In testimony before a Senate committee last month, Shimizu said the company was confident that its current line of air bags is safe. The company is in a precarious position. It has admitted that it cannot produce replacement air bags fast enough to meet the demand if the U.S. recall goes nationwide, even as it rushes to replace recalled air bags globally. Takata’s competitors say they could help fill the gap but would want long-term commitments from automakers to justify the expansion. Shares in the company have plunged 57 percent this year. “We recognize that NHTSA has urged Takata and our customers to support expansions of the current regional campaigns in the United States,” Takata chief executive Shigehisa Takada said in a statement Tuesday. “We will take all actions needed to advance the goal of safety for the driving public, including working to produce additional replacement units to support any further recalls that may be announced by our customers.” Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who chaired last month’s Senate hearing on Takata air bags, responded to the company’s statement by saying, “Anything short of a nationwide recall is unacceptable. “Just look at the thousands and thousands of people who come to Florida from colder climates each year,” Nelson said. “Don’t they face the same risks as people who live in humid areas year-round?” Neither Takata nor any of the five automakers that the NHTSA wants to issue a nationwide recall — Honda, Ford, Chrysler, Mazda and BMW — has agreed to do so. The NHTSA last week took the first formal step toward forcing a recall, demanding that Takata declare that millions of vehicles sold in the United States are equipped with defective air bags. “While a decision to keep the Takata air-bag recall regional may help the supplier address the near-term concerns it doesn’t answer the larger questions related to injuries and deaths that have occurred outside these humid areas,” said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “If more injuries or deaths happen outside the recall zones, it further damages Takata’s image while calling into question NHTSA’s understanding of the problem.” NHTSA released a statement after receiving Takada’s formal submission Tuesday. “We received Takata’s response to our Special Order and will immediately begin reviewing the documents as part of our ongoing investigation into ruptured Takata air bags,” the statement said. Air bags are among major automotive-safety advances that are credited with saving millions of lives worldwide. When vehicle sensors detect a collision they ignite a solid wafer of chemical propellant inside the metal cannister of the air-bag inflator. The chemical reaction creates a gas that causes the air bag to inflate within milliseconds, emerging from the steering wheel or dashboard. But if the propellant burns faster than intended, it creates more gas than the vents into the air bag can handle. The metal cannister can break into fragments that spray the driver or passengers. Takada announced in Tuesday’s statement that the company had recruited three former U.S. secretaries of transportation to review its current air-bag production and advise the company on its handling of the crisis. Samuel K. Skinner, who served as transportation secretary and White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush, has been asked to help with an audit and independent report on the manufacturing process. Rodney E. Slater, secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Norman Mineta, secretary under President George W. Bush, “will advise the company as we address the current challenges we face,” Takada said.	45	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 105, ""text"": ""nufacturer of automobile air bags that have killed at least five people and maimed scores of others"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 492, ""end"": 645, ""text"": ""HTSA wants regional recalls expanded to include all U.S. vehicles equipped with air-bag inflators that have sprayed drivers with shrapnel when deployed."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 926, ""end"": 1221, ""text"": ""At the hearing, members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce are expected to confront Hiroshi Shimizu, a Takata senior vice president, with the suspicion that his company has replaced air-bag inflators in more than 8 million vehicles with devices no better than the ones being recalled."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1223, ""end"": 1429, ""text"": ""akata has not disclosed whether it has made any changes to the design specifications or manufacturing processes for the replacement inflators,” says a memo prepared for the hearing by the committee’s staff"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1432, ""end"": 1679, ""text"": ""In discussions with staff, most vehicle manufacturers indicated that they were replacing the inflators with ‘like’ parts, indicating that it was the same inflator with the same propellant presumably manufactured the same way but of a newer vintage"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1737, ""end"": 1913, ""text"": ""Our members are hoping to gain a better understanding at [Wednesday’s] hearing of what is different and what improvements, if any, have been made in the manufacturing process."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2715, ""end"": 2882, ""text"": ""The company, which supplies one in five air bags worldwide, has identified production mistakes in one of its U.S. plants and exposure to high humidity as likely causes"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4823, ""end"": 4907, ""text"": ""millions of vehicles sold in the United States are equipped with defective air bags."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6021, ""end"": 6212, ""text"": ""if the propellant burns faster than intended, it creates more gas than the vents into the air bag can handle.

Federal regulators Wednesday took the first formal step toward forcing the recall of millions of cars equipped with driver-side air bags that have killed and maimed drivers with shrapnel when they have deployed. The call for a nationwide recall could affect five major auto manufacturers — BMW, Chrysler, Ford, Honda and Mazda — whose vehicles are equipped with Takata air bags. Since last year, 10 automakers have recalled 7.8 million vehicles with Takata air bags, most of them in humid regions of the country where the defect has been most evident. In a letter to the Japanese air-bag maker, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday that it would seek to fine Takata $7,000 per vehicle unless the company files a response by Dec. 2 admitting that some of its driver-side air bags are defective. “Takata has supplied millions of frontal driver’s side air bag inflators to at least five motor vehicle manufacturers over the last fifteen years,” Frank S. Borris II, NHTSA’s director of defect investigations, wrote to Takata. “A growing number of these inflators have ruptured, projecting metal fragments into vehicle occupants, thereby creating an unreasonable risk of death and injury.” At least five people have died — four of them in the United States — and scores have been injured when metal from the inflator cannister has sprayed them as the air-bag has deployed. Takata has admitted to production problems at its Washington state plant and theorized that the air-bag malfunctions were caused by persistent exposure to high humidity. Takata declined to comment on Wednesday’s NHTSA letter. The company resisted NHTSA’s call this month for a nationwide recall, arguing that it should address the need for replacement bags in humid regions where recalls already are underway. “Our best information supports the view that these regions must be the priority for the replacement of air bags,” Takata Vice President Hiroshi Shimizu said at a U.S. Senate hearing last week. “It is imperative that all owners of the affected vehicles in these regions respond to the recall notices at the earliest opportunity.” In his Wednesday letter to Takata, however, Borris said recent cases demonstrate that the problem is not limited to humid regions. He cited instances this year when the California driver of a Honda and the North Carolina driver of a Ford were cut and burned by shrapnel from defective Takata air bags. “Takata has provided no justification for limiting the geographic scope to the high absolute humidity region,” Borris wrote. “NHTSA is issuing this recall request letter to notify you that the agency has tentatively concluded that a defect related to motor vehicle safety exists on a national basis . . . and to demand that Takata issue [a recall],” Borris wrote. Automakers in June announced recalls in the high-humidity areas, and some manufacturers began recalling vehicles with the bags years earlier. Eighteen months ago, Toyota recalled 170,000 of its Corollas, Sequoias, Tundras and Lexus SC 430 models built from 2003 to 2011. NHTSA’s Wednesday letter to Takata is known as a formal demand letter. NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman outlined the steps that will follow after he testified before the Senate committee last week. “If they refuse [to order a recall], then we will further build up our case and hold a public hearing to give them the opportunity to give their side,” Friedman said. “But, frankly, also to give the public the opportunity to hear how weak their case is. After that hearing, I would make a final determination of a vehicle defect, which then would be enforceable in the court.” Takata makes 1 in 5 air bags worldwide. Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said Wednesday that NHTSA was taking the correct and necessary action in moving to force Takata to recall the air bags. “Given the apparent lethal consequences to its failure, it would be tragic to see fatalities continue in the future,” Brauer said. “However, it will be a huge challenge for all [of the auto] manufacturers affected to get notices out to current owners and to stock enough replacement air bags to handle the volume of vehicles affected in a timely fashion.”	44	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 211, ""text"": ""al regulators Wednesday took the first formal step toward forcing the recall of millions of cars equipped with driver-side air bags that have killed and maimed drivers with shrapnel when they have deployed."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 379, ""end"": 550, ""text"": ""Since last year, 10 automakers have recalled 7.8 million vehicles with Takata air bags, most of them in humid regions of the country where the defect has been most evident"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1052, ""end"": 1396, ""text"": ""A growing number of these inflators have ruptured, projecting metal fragments into vehicle occupants, thereby creating an unreasonable risk of death and injury.” At least five people have died — four of them in the United States — and scores have been injured when metal from the inflator cannister has sprayed them as the air-bag has deployed."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1397, ""end"": 1565, ""text"": ""Takata has admitted to production problems at its Washington state plant and theorized that the air-bag malfunctions were caused by persistent exposure to high humidity"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2136, ""end"": 2436, ""text"": ""In his Wednesday letter to Takata, however, Borris said recent cases demonstrate that the problem is not limited to humid regions.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said this week that 3 million additional vehicles may need urgent repairs to prevent drivers and passengers from being injured because of defective air bags. The now 7.8 million vehicles that are part of the recall have air bags manufactured by Takata. At least four people have died when inflator mechanisms ruptured on the air bags, spraying the passengers with metal fragments. Automobiles manufactured by Mitsubishi and Subaru are among those that have been added to the list. NHTSA said owners who live in Florida, Puerto Rico, limited areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii, should be especially aggressive in acting on the notice. That’s in part because extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperature may be a factor in the air-bag problem. “Responding to these recalls, whether old or new, is essential to personal safety and it will help aid our ongoing investigation into Takata airbags and what appears to be a problem related to extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperatures. However, we’re leaving no stone unturned in our aggressive pursuit to track down the full geographic scope of this issue,” NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman said in a news release announcing the additional vehicles. On Monday, NHTSA announced that roughly 4.7 million vehicles could be affected by the recall. Car owners should check their manufacturer’s Web site for recall information. They will need their vehicle identification number (VIN) in order to determine whether their car is included. A Web site maintained by the NHTSA — Safercar.gov — has not been functioning because of overwhelming demand. Below is an updated list of vehicles that may be affected by the recall.

The company whose defective air bags will result in one of the largest vehicle recalls in history stopped short of endorsing an expanded nationwide recall in a contentious Senate hearing Thursday. Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) challenged Takata Vice President Hiroshi Shimizu about whether his company supported a nationwide recall rather than limiting the recall to humid regions where the air bags have been known to malfunction. “It’s hard for me to answer yes or no,” Shimizu said. “It’s not hard to answer yes or no,” Markey responded. “I can’t answer,” Shimizu said. “I’m going to take that as a no,” Markey said. “I think that you’re plain wrong. Your company is making a big mistake in not supporting [a nationwide] recall.” The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called Tuesday for a nationwide recall of vehicles equipped with Takata driver-side air bags, a move that could involve 20 million cars and cost Takata an estimated $852 million. NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman said after the hearing that he would take steps to enforce the recall unless automakers voluntarily comply. Takata air bags are installed in 1 in 5 vehicles worldwide, including many models of the domestic and foreign cars sold in the United States. NHTSA has been investigating whether Takata air-bag inflators that have been exposed to consistently high humidity are responsible for 130 injuries and at least four deaths in the United States and one in Malaysia. Humidity may cause the bags to deploy with so much force that they spray drivers with shards of metal from their steel inflators. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) compared the air bags to a “live hand grenade” poised at a driver’s chest. He called on the U.S. Transportation Department to level fines of up to $1 million a day on automakers who don’t give owners a replacement vehicle to drive until the faulty air bags are replaced. Facing executives from two of the affected manufacturers — Chrysler and Honda — Nelson said they should be “providing . . . a loaner or rental car to people who potentially would be driving a death trap.” The two executives said they would provide vehicles to customers when their recalls take effect but stopped short of offering to provide them immediately. Honda, with 45 injuries and four deaths attributed to Takata air bags, began recalling cars for air-bag replacements in 2008. More than 5 million Hondas ultimately may be subject to recall. “We understand the urgency of the current situation and are taking proactive steps to encourage Honda and Acura owners to get their vehicles repaired at an authorized dealership,” Rick Schostek, executive vice president at Honda North America, told the committee. Friedman said he would push the automakers to send letters to all owners of cars equipped with the air bags. “Until they step up for the American public, my hands are tied, frankly, to help people understand who is at risk,” Friedman said. Friedman told the committee that Takata was guilty of poor quality control and record keeping. “We know that Takata hasn’t always provided the automobile industry with accurate information,” he said. In one of the hearing’s most tense moments, Sen. Dean Heller (R.-Nev.) asked Shimizu whether Takata took “full responsibility for these tragic deaths” linked to its air bags. Shimizu, who had been testifying in English, paused and then consulted with an interpreter. “We recognize that three victims’ cases are related to our products,” Shimizu said after a brief discussion. “The other two are under investigation.” Nelson described Shimizu’s pause before responding as “painful.” Both Schostek and Scott Kunselman, Chrysler's senior vice president for vehicle safety and regulatory compliance, equivocated when Markey asked whether they supported a nationwide recall. “Each of you should be saying yes,” Markey said. When Heller asked Schostek whether his daughter’s Honda was safe to drive, he wasn’t happy with the imprecise response. “It was clear you weren’t sure how to respond,” Heller said. Since 2013, 7.8 million vehicles have been recalled, most of them in regions of the United States with high humidity. Now NHTSA wants a national recall by Takata and 10 automakers — BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota — who use their bags in some models. Takata contended this week that it has tested close to 1,000 of its air bags in regions where humidity is low and that none of them has ruptured dangerously. The company says a nationwide recall may put “lives at risk” by diverting replacement air bags from regions that need them most. The emergence Thursday of a fatality attributed to a Takata air bag in arid Arizona gave a new twist to pinning down the cause of the deadly deployments. Markey and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called a news conference before the hearing to discuss the case of Charlene Weaver, who died of multiple skull fractures and brain hemorrhages as the result of an air-bag deployment when she was riding in a 2004 Subaru Impreza in 2003. “We need to learn the details,” said Friedman, who was unaware of the incident. Markey and Blumenthal have called for a federal criminal investigation into whether the company sought to cover up the defects after they first surfaced in 2004. “Reports that Takata concealed and destroyed test results revealing fatal air-bag defects, along with other evidence that the company was aware of these deadly problems, clearly require a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice,” Blumenthal and Markey said in a joint statement this month. “If the reports are true, the company must be held accountable for the horrific deaths and injuries that its wrongdoing caused.” The report, published in the New York Times earlier this month, described the accounts of two unnamed former Takata employees who said the company attempted to cover up the defects when they were discovered during 2004 testing at Takata’s American headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. Friedman said after the hearing that his agency has been cooperating with a Justice Department investigation since September. Shimizu told the committee that replacement bags and those now being installed in new cars pose no risk. “We are confident that the air bags Takata is producing today, including the replacements for recalled units, are safe,” Shimizu said. In a new report published Thursday, the Times said Takata’s decision to switch to a new formula using ammonium nitrate may be responsible for the defect caused by temperature and humidity changes. Shimizu didn’t respond directly when questioned about the potential defect. “The question was not answered,” Nelson said in the hallway after he adjourned the hearing. He said Shimizu, Schostek and Kunselman did “the shuffle, two step and side step” in response to many of the questions. Nelson and Sen. John Thune (R.-S.D.) said they would introduce legislation to encourage whisteblowers from the automotive sector to come forward with “original information” about defects or attempts to cover them up. “We want them to come forward,” Thune said at Thursday’s hearing, alluding to the numerous auto recalls this year. “The public’s confidence has been shaken.

More than 30 million cars and trucks nationwide are equipped with dangerously defective air bags, congressional officials say, a number that raises questions about whether the U.S. auto industry can handle what could become the largest recall in history. Federal safety authorities have recalled only 7.8 million vehicles over the defect in a few states, a limited action that lawmakers said Thursday was vastly insufficient to address what they deemed “a public safety threat.” Two senators demanded a much broader recall that would cover every affected vehicle nationwide. But a recall of that magnitude — including best-selling models from Honda, Toyota, GM, Chrysler and six other companies spanning 2002 to 2007 — could prove far greater than the industry has ever managed. Manufacturing that many replacement parts could take years and present a variety of logistical nightmares. Dealerships could quickly become overwhelmed by the demand, auto safety experts said. This year, GM recalled a total of 30 million vehicles for faulty ignition switches and other problems, and months later it is struggling to make the repairs. The defective air bags, made by Japanese manufacturer Takata, can rupture and blast out metal shards, particularly in humid conditions, government officials have said. While the rate of reported incidents is low, linked to four deaths and more than 100 injuries so far, their grisly severity has spurred an urgent debate about the matter in Washington. Driving her Honda Accord on Christmas Eve in 2009, Gurjit Rathore, a 33-year-old Virginia mother, was struck in the neck by pieces of an exploding air bag and bled to death in front of her three children, according to a lawsuit filed by her family. Takata controls more than 30 percent of the world’s air-bag market, triggering worries that the recall could grow in the United States and elsewhere. Meanwhile, automakers say new air bags are already in short supply. Honda said it does not have enough parts to immediately fix the more than 5 million Accords, Civics and other vehicles with defective air bags. For a temporary fix, Toyota is instructing its dealerships to disable air bags and attach notes on vehicles’ glove boxes warning against riding in the passenger seat. “It would take potentially years for this to be addressed. That is what is scary about this,” said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “You could have tens of millions of dangerous vehicles on the road.” In a letter Thursday to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said they were “increasingly troubled and alarmed” by regulators’ public guidance. Markey’s office put the number of affected vehicles at 30 million by examining auto registration and other federal transportation data. “The information available to us indicates no factual basis for distinguishing between states or regions of the country regarding the potential severe danger of this defect,” they wrote. “Replacement parts are ‘essential to personal safety’ for all drivers whether they live in New England or Florida.” Regulators pushed back, saying a nationwide recall would divert a limited supply of replacement air bags “from those at demonstrated risk” in areas with long-term humidity and heat. They added that they were urging Takata and other suppliers to boost production. “We have taken an aggressive and relatively unprecedented step by forcing a regional recall on limited information,” Transportation Department spokesman Brian Farber said in a statement, “and we will not rest until we know the full geographic scope of the problem.” To help car owners check whether their vehicles are the subjects of an active recall, the government set up the Web site www.safercar.gov. But over the past few days, the recall search function has been down. Takata spokesman Alby Berman did not return messages seeking comment Thursday. Honda said it “has nearly completed the mailing of notifications regarding the special campaign,” and Toyota, the largest carmaker in the world, said it has intensified efforts to reach customers “in certain geographic areas that appear to warrant immediate action.” But in a letter to regulators last week, Markey and Blumenthal criticized the “arbitrary geographic boundaries” of automakers’ “puzzling and inconsistent” recall. While Subaru and BMW have announced nationwide recalls for Takata air bags, Honda, with millions more affected vehicles, limited its messaging to a group of U.S. islands and Southern states. “Manufacturers are all over the lot” in deciding which areas were affected, said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. “How is it that one manufacturer has a bigger danger area than another?” The limited regional recall means owners of defective cars in non-recall states will neither be notified of the danger nor qualify for free repairs. At least two of the fatal accidents linked to the defect occurred in areas not included in the recall, including in Virginia and Oklahoma. Because the cars are tracked only when they’re registered or initially sold, a move or sale to someone in a more humid area would mean the defect could go ignored for years. More than 3 million recalled cars and trucks were listed for sale last year, according to Carfax. “You can live in upper Wisconsin and register your car there but drive to Florida and spend a heck of a lot of time there. You wouldn’t be traced by the manufacturer or NHTSA,” said Ellen Bloom, senior director of federal policy for Consumers Union, an advocacy group. “To assume that people are registering their cars and limiting their driving to where they registered is pretty shortsighted.” More than 50 million cars and trucks have already been recalled in what has become the worst year for recalls in U.S. history, with 1 in 5 vehicles on the road at risk of critical defects. In the case of the Takata air bags, the full range of affected vehicles remains unclear. The most recently updated NHTSA warning Thursday said an “undetermined number” of General Motors vehicles were equipped with defective air bags. The list of affected vehicles has grown by millions of cars since Monday, with many vehicles incorrectly added or excluded from the recall on lists made public by regulators. Geographic recalls have been criticized as a way for automakers to restrict their repair spending while leaving a subset of drivers at risk. In 2004, the Center for Auto Safety unsuccessfully sued NHTSA, claiming geographic recalls violated the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which requires that automakers notify all owners of defective vehicles and provide a free remedy. “It’s totally arbitrary, and they use it to save money and have as narrow a recall as possible,” said Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA head and longtime traffic safety advocate. “There’s no rationale for it other than to save money.” Members of Congress have requested briefings with NHTSA officials. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has investigated the General Motors and Toyota recalls, said in a statement Wednesday that “we also need to take a close look at . . . the timeline and scope of the recalls,” adding, “When it comes to vehicle safety, there can be no margin for error.” Related: It’s the worst year ever for auto recalls. Why are so many dangerous cars still on the road?
