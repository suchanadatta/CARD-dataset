The U.S. military is preparing for a series of meetings that could shake up how the Pentagon flies its fleet of drone aircraft and move them toward hunting together in packs. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency will host the gatherings in March for its Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program, it said this week. The major emphasis: Figuring out a way to move free of having a pilot operate only one drone with assistance from a sensor operator and a team of intelligence analysts through satellite links. “Just as wolves hunt in coordinated packs with minimal communication, multiple CODE-enabled unmanned aircraft would collaborate to find, track, identify and engage targets, all under the command of a single human mission supervisor,” said Jean-Charles Ledé, the program’s manager, in a statement. DARPA officials said the CODE program would use a combination of software and algorithms to “extend the mission capabilities of existing unmanned aircraft well beyond the current state-of-the-art.” It also would allow drones to operate in areas in which electronic warfare might be used against them or they might be shot down, officials said. A “Proposer’s Day” for the CODE program was held in April. In an explanation provided beforehand, DARPA officials said that while military drones have been successful over the last 25 years, the current systems would be vulnerable in the future. Among the goals: Develop the ability for one mission commander to control numerous drones at one time, develop flexibility so drones in an area can communicate and protect each other, and geo-locating possible targets with powerful sensors and guiding less capable systems within their own ranges.	170	"[{""start"": 345, ""end"": 536, ""text"": ""The major emphasis: Figuring out a way to move free of having a pilot operate only one drone with assistance from a sensor operator and a team of intelligence analysts through satellite links"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 345, ""end"": 536, ""text"": ""The major emphasis: Figuring out a way to move free of having a pilot operate only one drone with assistance from a sensor operator and a team of intelligence analysts through satellite links"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	180	2023-03-23T09:07:44.673011Z	2023-03-23T09:07:44.673168Z	1154.555
"With so much attention being devoted to commercial drones these days, it's easy to forget that the military's long-term strategy for unmanned systems is still a work in progress. A lot of the funding for drone operations comes from the special budget for the war in Afghanistan — and as the drawdown begins, that money is going to dry up. That's a big problem for the military. It now has to transform what was originally a stopgap solution into a sustainable function of the armed services. That process is also going to grant drones a more important place in combat, according to the latest revision to a 25-year roadmap the Pentagon released this week. Depending on the kind of drone we're talking about — unmanned aerial systems (UAS), unmanned ground systems (UGS) or unmanned maritime systems (UMS) — the Pentagon foresees an array of different problems that all need to be tackled over the next quarter century. The near-term will mostly involve making sure the technology works at all. As we move into the next decade, that will give way to exploiting the real potential of unmanned systems. That's when a lot of the changes to doctrine and strategy will begin to take effect. Advances in commercial technology will help speed that process. So will research being done by the Pentagon itself. But the biggest challenges aren't necessarily technical. Take how humans will be expected to interact with their machines in the field. While it's tempting to think about whole fleets of unmanned ships steaming across the ocean as one, the reality is that people are going to be right alongside them for the foreseeable future. There may be fewer humans than drones in a unit. But you might have, for instance, a human pilot being aided by a set of unmanned wingmen in the air. The military already has a name for this: Manned-Unmanned System Teaming, or MUM-T. Figuring out how much interaction will be needed is going to be an ongoing process. Another problem strategists are predicting is the information overload that comes along with vast amounts of data. Drones right now are great at feeding live images and video back to their operators, but that creates obstacles of their own: The more unmanned systems the Pentagon operates, the more bandwidth they require, and the more money the Defense Department has to spend on commercial satellite contracts to carry those transmissions. What's more, sending pictures back for people to look at is an inherently inefficient way of doing business. It would be much better, the Pentagon reasons, if the drone were smart enough to ping somebody only when it recognized an object of interest. That would cut down on the amount of data flowing back and forth, making it easier to load the system with more drones and freeing up people to do other things. Grappling with that will mean having to sort out what we mean by ""automation"" — when human pilots are no longer directly controlling the drones remotely, as they do today. There are two ways to think about that: execution and performance. ""The difference between execution and performance,"" the report notes, ""is that the former simply executes a preprogrammed plan whereas performance is associated with mission outcomes that can vary even during a mission and require deviation from preprogrammed tasks."" It takes a smart machine to recognize and respond to changing conditions. Part of the solution lies in building drones — and equipping them — in adaptable ways. Weapons of the future won't be repurposed from helicopters but designed specifically for drone fleets themselves. These drone-specific munitions might be capable of different yields that can be adjusted before use; they might be ultra lightweight; or they be able to adjust their own trajectory in mid-flight. Even further down the road — into the 2020s and 2030s — the military expects to learn more about nanoparticles and their potential for creating much larger explosions than today's ordnance. The Air Force is already experimenting with an aluminum powder that may prove promising, according to the report."	169	"[{""start"": 179, ""end"": 338, ""text"": ""A lot of the funding for drone operations comes from the special budget for the war in Afghanistan — and as the drawdown begins, that money is going to dry up."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 497, ""end"": 654, ""text"": ""rocess is also going to grant drones a more important place in combat, according to the latest revision to a 25-year roadmap the Pentagon released this week"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 994, ""end"": 1184, ""text"": ""As we move into the next decade, that will give way to exploiting the real potential of unmanned systems.

In what will probably be considered a step forward for autonomous military technology, the Pentagon said in a statement Monday that it had successfully demonstrated “one of the world’s largest micro-drone swarms” over China Lake, Calif., in October. The exercise, put on by Naval Air Systems Command and the Pentagon’s five-year-old Strategic Capabilities Office, involved three F/A-18 multi-role fighters dropping 103 of the tiny remote-controlled aircraft — known as Perdix micro-drones — from specially designed canisters affixed under the aircrafts’ fuselages. The test was first covered by CBS’s 60 Minutes on Sunday. Named after a character in Greek mythology, the Perdix is a cheap, lightweight, 3-D-printed drone that is capable of low‐altitude reconnaissance and “other missions,” according to a Pentagon fact sheet. The drone was originally designed by engineering students at MIT. The drones, instead of individually being given an order, are instead told to conduct broad tasks, such as observing an enemy airfield. The drone swarm then executes the mission, flying and adapting by communicating with one another with little human input. “Due to the complex nature of combat, Perdix are not pre-programmed synchronized individuals, they are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,” said William Roper, the director of the Strategic Capabilities Office. Perdix drones were first dropped in 2014 from a F-16 fighter over Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., according to the fact sheet. After that, they were used during military exercises in Alaska in 2015. Although the Perdix is billed as a surveillance tool, it would take little to imagine the small devices as half-foot-long bombs launched to overwhelm a target by sheer volume or to decimate an enemy airfield or ship without endangering pilots. In the statement, Roper emphasized that human operators will always “be in the loop” when it comes to the Pentagon’s burgeoning autonomous systems such as the Perdix swarms, meaning that an actual person will have the final say on how the drones and other similar equipment is employed. Although the Perdix is part of the Pentagon’s “future battle network,” according to Roper, it is unclear exactly what that means when it comes to how the small devices will be used. With some human input, though, the Perdix is technically semiautonomous. Drones or weapons that can select and engage targets by themselves — something the Perdix might be able to do in the future — are considered fully autonomous. In a February report, Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at Center for a New American Security, highlighted the risk of autonomous weapons stating that they “pose a novel risk of mass fratricide, with large numbers of weapons turning on friendly forces.” “This could be because of hacking, enemy behavioral manipulation, unexpected interactions with the environment, or simple malfunctions or software errors,” Scharre wrote. “Moreover, as the complexity of the system increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to verify the system’s behavior under all possible conditions; the number of potential interactions within the system and with its environment is simply too large.” Human Rights Watch has called for “an international treaty preemptively banning the development, production, and use” of autonomous weapons through their effort called the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.	168	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 228, ""text"": ""In what will probably be considered a step forward for autonomous military technology, the Pentagon said in a statement Monday that it had successfully demonstrated “one of the world’s largest micro-drone swarms” over China Lake"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	178	2023-03-23T08:51:00.450408Z	2023-03-23T08:51:00.450509Z	748.872
The Air Force is grappling with how to manage a potential glut of drones and may eventually scale back the number of combat missions flown with unmanned aircraft by more than 25 percent, the service’s top commander said Wednesday. Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, the Air Force chief of staff, said the Predator and Reaper drones that have been a mainstay of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are not well suited to many other regions where the U.S. military is looking to bolster its presence, such as the Pacific. “I am a big fan of UAVs where they make sense,” he said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles. “We shouldn’t rush into buying a whole bunch of remotely piloted aircraft just because we can.” Welsh’s comments at a breakfast sponsored by the Defense Writers Group are the latest sign that the Air Force may have overfed its once-insatiable appetite for drones. Under plans pushed by then-Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the Air Force was supposed to buy enough drones and train enough crews so that it could fly 65 combat air patrols round-the-clock by 2013. The Air Force never quite reached that high, having maxed out at 62 combat air patrols today. Welsh said the service would probably reduce that number substantially. Although officials haven’t finalized a figure, he said “in the vicinity of 45 would be a good start.” Welsh said a reduction is not imminent and probably wouldn’t happen until the end of combat operations in Afghanistan. The Air Force also uses the drones for surveillance and counter­terrorism missions in places such as Yemen, West Africa, the Turkish-­Iraqi border and Somalia. It takes up to four drones to provide 24-hour coverage for a single combat air patrol. Although the aircraft are unmanned, they require lots of personnel to fly them by remote control and provide support on the ground — about 400 to 500 people for each combat air patrol. “I don’t know where we’re going to go, but building bigger, more expensive, more cosmic [drones] probably isn’t the answer,” Welsh said. “There’s nothing cheap about them.” The armed Predators and Reapers are tailor-made for counter­terrorism operations and war zones such as Afghanistan, where the U.S. military controls the skies and the enemy lacks sufficient firepower to shoot down the drones. But the slow-moving planes aren’t designed to withstand antiaircraft defenses or air-to-air combat. “Predators and Reapers are useless in a contested environment,” Gen. Mike Hostage, chief of the Air Combat Command, said at a conference in September. “I couldn’t put one into the Strait of Hormuz without having to put airplanes there to protect it.” Welsh told reporters that the Air Force needs to spend more on other methods to conduct reconnaissance and gather intelligence from the air. He declined to be specific, but other Air Force officials have advocated more money for satellites, manned spy planes and advanced stealth drones, as well as more-powerful electronic sensors for surveillance. In Asia, the Air Force is still planning to expand its use of another kind of surveillance drone — the Global Hawk — which can stay aloft much longer and fly far greater distances than the Reaper or the Predator. Unlike those drones, the Global Hawk is unarmed. Last month, U.S. and Japanese officials announced an agreement to base a handful of Global Hawks in Japan, starting next year. The Air Force already flies Global Hawks from a base in Guam. Welsh made clear, however, that he thinks the Air Force needs to dedicate the bulk of its long-term budget to modernize and upgrade traditional types of aircraft — those flown by pilots in the cockpit. In the coming years, for example, the Air Force plans to buy more than 1,700 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets, will replace many of its aging refueling tankers and is designing a new long-range stealth bomber. All of those airplanes will cost exponentially more than most types of drones. “We don’t exist to fight a counter­insurgency,” Welsh said, referring to the types of wars fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. “We can help in that, but air forces — major air forces — exist to fight full-spectrum conflict against a well-armed, well-trained determined foe. If we can’t do that as a nation, then I don’t think we’re doing our job.”	167	"[{""start"": 8, ""end"": 229, ""text"": ""Force is grappling with how to manage a potential glut of drones and may eventually scale back the number of combat missions flown with unmanned aircraft by more than 25 percent, the service’s top commander said Wednesda"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 872, ""end"": 1113, ""text"": ""plans pushed by then-Defense Secretary Robert M.

The Air Force units that run the service’s fleet of drone aircraft are “under significant stress,” with long hours and a potential brain drain coming that will prompt a variety of changes, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said Thursday. James, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said that the “unrelenting pace” of remotely piloted aircraft requirements means that those who operate them work six days in a row on average, typically for 13 or 14 hours each. An average pilot flying a manned aircraft flies about 200 or 300 hours per year, but drone pilots fly 900 to 1,100, she said. “Our plan is designed to immediately relieve some of this strain while still meeting the combatant commander requirements, and then we of course recognize we’ll have more work to do for the somewhat longer term to address the people side of this very important, but nonetheless high-demand weapons system,” James said. http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/air-force-drone-pilots-are-worn-out/2015/01/15/47a76c59-53ad-4528-8b77-089213005956_video.html The Air Force also has another related problem on the horizon, she said, appearing alongside Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh. Many of the service’s experienced drone pilots are nearing the end of their active-duty contracts at the same time. If the service can’t retain enough of them, that would effectively amount to a brain drain in a force filling a vital mission over Iraq, Syria and other conflict zones. Several options are on the table to address the issues, James and Welsh said. First, the Air Force plans to use the National Guard and reserve, bringing some of those willing and able to work with unmanned aircraft on active-duty. The service also will seek volunteers who have flown drones in the past, but gone back to flying manned aircraft. The Air Force also will delay the departure of some drone pilots who had moved into the field temporarily, a move that likely to be unpopular with those waiting to return to flying conventional aircraft. “Those three items, we are acting on now,” James said. “And we believe that this will provide some near-term relief to the ops tempo and to boost the quality of life concerns of this force.” The service also may boost pay for drone operators, the secretary added. Previously, service policy did not allow Air Force officials to offer retention bonuses to drone pilots who are only qualified to fly unmanned aircraft, but the service is working to change that, she said. “As our experienced operators reach the end of their initial active-duty service commitment, we will increase the monthly incentive pay from $650 a month to $1,500 for those [drone] pilots while we also explore more permanent incentive plans, which will be a little bit more down the road,” she said. The problems received widespread attention after an internal Air Force memo was published by the Daily Beast this month. In it, Gen. Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle, the chief of Air Combat Command, said the service was facing a “perfect storm” of increased demand and other problems that would damage combat readiness and capability of the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drone fleets for years. Welsh said the Air Force also is considering having enlisted troops flying the service’s drones in the future. The Army does that, but so far only officers pilot the Air Force’s. Enlisted troops work with them, manning the high-powered sensors used for surveillance from the drones. The service also is considering recruiting pilots from other services, he said.

CREECH AIR FORCE BASE, Nev. — Under a searing desert sun, a man in silhouette is pacing sentry-like around a cluster of buildings, a dark object slung over his shoulder. “Yeah, it looks like a gun,” says an American drone pilot, peering into a gray-tone screen in a darkened, distant trailer. The pilot, who Air Force officials asked be identified only as Capt. Bert, is talking to ground headquarters through a headset. He then counts off the half-minute until one of the drone’s Hellfire missiles strikes its target, throwing the man to the ground with a flash of light. The ground controller’s voice comes back in a static burst. “Confirmed: enemy killed in action.” But this target is not a suspected militant on the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan. He’s a U.S. airman, role-playing in the desert outside Las Vegas, and the missile strike was a training simulation at the Nevada air base that coordinates U.S. drone flight overseas. Air Force officials hope to provide more training missions like this for drone operators as the U.S. military cuts back the pace of drone operations overseas. They say increased training for new and existing pilots, along with steps to improve pilot recruitment and retention, is crucial to maintaining the effectiveness of an overstressed force and would help the Air Force meet future demand for remotely piloted flight. The plan to reduce drone capacity to a maximum of 60 simultaneous combat flights by this fall, which the Air Force made public this spring, is the centerpiece of an effort to make the pace of Air Force drone operations more sustainable, and to help heal the stresses caused by a decade of frenetic expansion. But with renewed operations in Iraq against the Islamic State, a new campaign of strikes against the group in Syria and continued operations in Afghanistan, the demand for unmanned aircraft’s surveillance and combat powers is higher than ever. Col. James “Cliffy” Cluff, the top Air Force commander for remotely piloted aircraft, said the service had expected demand for drone flights to fall off as the United States wrapped up its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That plan “was overcome by the enemy,” he told reporters in a rare media visit to Creech Air Force Base, where Cluff commands 3,000 pilots and support personnel. Since last summer’s dramatic advances by Islamic State militants, U.S. aircraft have conducted 3,600 strikes in Iraq and Syria, many of them conducted by unmanned planes. The remotely piloted aircraft program burst into action in the decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In 2001, the Air Force was only capable of keeping two drones flying combat missions at a time. Behind every drone in the air conducting a combat air patrol, there are hundreds of personnel required to maintain active and reserve aircraft and amass intelligence and even special teams deployed overseas dedicated to takeoff and landing of aircraft. By 2010, during President Obama’s surge of troops to Afghanistan, the program’s flight capacity had reached 39. It peaked at 65 in 2014. The growth has complicated challenges the Air Force has faced in fielding and retaining pilots for the program, which has often been seen by pilots as an unattractive alternative to piloting manned aircraft. Today, the Air Force needs to produce 300 new drone pilots a year. Because of recruitment and training constraints, it is only producing 180.The Air Force also loses 240 drone pilots each year as airmen return to other duties or they leave the service altogether. The 500 pilots and 500 sensor operators at Creech, nestled among bare hillsides an hour’s drive from Las Vegas, have pushed themselves hard in recent years to keep pace with the demands of overseas operations. While they typically work shifts of at least eight flight hours, five days on and then two to three days off, they are often called in for a sixth consecutive day because of personnel shortages. The strains of that pace are “why we’re attacking the manning problem today.” As commander of Creech, Cluff is in the odd position of touting the effectiveness of the skills of the airmen of his 432nd Wing and 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing and their arsenal of more than 130 Predator, Reaper and Sentinel aircraft while also pushing for recognition that the pace of their operations must be eased. Earlier this year, the Air Force announced plans to address gaps in drone pilots, including larger retention bonuses and greater use of reservists, National Guard personnel and contractors. A reduction in U.S. drone flights comes as other nations seek to accelerate their own unmanned flight programs, which has the potential to ease the future burden to U.S. operations. The United States is also moving to allow the sale of lethal American drone technology to certain allies. Kelley Sayler, an associate fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the reduction in flight capacity would “necessarily degrade” U.S. intelligence capabilities. In the long run, she said, the Air Force must increase promotions and other opportunities available to drone pilots and consider making the job accessible to enlisted personnel or others with a lesser level of training. “If the Air Force simply maintains its current course, we’re likely to see continued problems with retention, which could in turn result in further reductions in [flight capacity] and negatively impact future military operations,” she said. The job is made personal for Shantae, a sensor operator who like other personnel asked to be identified only by her rank and first name. The daughter of an active duty Marine, the senior airman takes pride in a mission she sees as primarily about keeping American personnel safe overseas. Air Force officials said the vast majority of unmanned flight hours are dedicated to surveillance, including watching over American troops as they conduct operations overseas. But she acknowledged that events on the battlefield sometimes “weigh heavy on you.” The flight demands are made more striking by the fact that drone operators, like a small number of U.S. military personnel stationed in the United States, are “deployed in place.” While they may take part in combat operations during the day, most airmen get into their cars after their shifts conclude and make the 50-minute drive back to Las Vegas, with its lights and revelry. “Every single day this base is at war,” Cluff said. While the dissonance of remote warfare is real, a 2012 survey showed that what drone operators struggled with the most were familiar challenges: the demands of shift work, long hours, lack of sleep and inadequate staffing. To address both kinds of stress, in 2011 the base stood up a “human performance team” including experts in air physiology, psychology and flight medicine, and chaplains, all of whom have top-level security clearances. The Air Force is now trying to replicate the team elsewhere, officials at the base said. In 2014 alone, officials at the base said, they made 13 “suicide saves,” or interventions with service members who were contemplating suicide. The suicide rate is no higher among drone personnel than other Air Force personnel. While in other parts of the Air Force medical personnel might focus on training pilots on coping with high altitudes, those who operate unmanned aircraft must instead find ways to counteract the fatigue associated with long shifts sitting in trailers, their eyes glued to screens. Maj. Maria Elena Gomez-Mejia, who focuses on operational physiology, said many airmen struggled to adjust to regular changing work schedules that could keep them at Creech all or part of the night. Over time, Air Force officials also hope to upgrade equipment in ways that will lessen the toll of long pilot hours. Now, pilots and their sensor operators must contend with a crowded array of 14 different screens, which provide information on everything from the aircraft’s position and course to area topography. To communicate with personnel on the ground or in the air, they can use radio, online chat or phone. The cluttered arrangement has not changed significantly in 15 years, Col. Matthew Finnegan said. A next-generation cockpit now under development will merge those screens and streamline communications.	164	"[{""start"": 1099, ""end"": 1362, ""text"": ""They say increased training for new and existing pilots, along with steps to improve pilot recruitment and retention, is crucial to maintaining the effectiveness of an overstressed force and would help the Air Force meet future demand for remotely piloted flight."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1503, ""end"": 1671, ""text"": ""is the centerpiece of an effort to make the pace of Air Force drone operations more sustainable, and to help heal the stresses caused by a decade of frenetic expansion."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1829, ""end"": 1914, ""text"": ""he demand for unmanned aircraft’s surveillance and combat powers is higher than ever"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2573, ""end"": 2921, ""text"": ""In 2001, the Air Force was only capable of keeping two drones flying combat missions at a time.
