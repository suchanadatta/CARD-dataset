Scientists, public health experts and volunteers working with them have started to show up at music festivals, concerts, raves and other public gatherings where illicit drugs are frequently used. Equipped with special chemical testing kits, they help attendees test pills and powder for purity in real time so that people can make better-informed decisions about whether to take them. The practice — more common in Europe than in the United States — is controversial, and the debate has been similar to the early days of needle-exchange programs in the 1980s. Proponents argue harm reduction. They say people are more likely to reject taking drugs to get high if the substances do not contain what they think they do, which reduces the risk of overdose and other harmful effects. Critics say such programs implicitly encourage the use of illegal drugs. There hasn't been a lot of hard data about pill testing until this month, when a study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found some surprising things about one of the most popular street drugs being used today. Called Molly, the drug is a form of ecstasy or MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) and sought after for its ability to create euphoria and heightened sensations in users. It typically sells for $10 to $20 a dose. As of 2014, a government survey estimated, 7 percent of the U.S. population had tried ecstasy at least once. Molly's appeal is that it's supposed to be purer and safer. So why then has there been an increase in hospital emergency room visits and deaths related to the drugs due to Molly? Researchers looked at data collected by volunteers for the nonprofit organization DanceSafe, who tested samples of pills or powder at gatherings throughout the United States between July 2010 and July 2015. The testers would scrape a small amount of a pill or use part of the inside of a capsule. The first thing the volunteers found was that MDMA was present in only 60 percent of the 529 ostensible Molly samples collected. The others contained a mix of all sorts of other ingredients. Most of the chemicals couldn't be identified through the tests at the sites. But 13 samples contained methamphetamine, a strong nervous system drug. And three samples even had a very potent form of amphetamine known as PMA, which is more likely than many other drugs to kill with one dose. The researchers concluded that Molly is no safer than ecstasy. The study also contained some important findings from a public policy perspective. After attendees at these events got the test results for their pills or powder, they were asked whether they still intended to ingest them. With individuals whose drugs did contain MDMA, 46 percent said they would go ahead and use them. That compared with 26 percent of people who said they still intended to take their drugs although they did not contain MDMA. Such testing programs are catching on in more countries. For the first time in Britain, the more than 200,000 attendees at last year's outdoor music festival Kendal Calling had access to a tent where their pills could be tested, according to NPR. And Australia may conduct a trial at the Spilt Milk festival in November. The “government wants to carefully go through all the details of the arrangements before allowing pill testing to take place,” Alex Wodak, president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, and his colleagues wrote in an opinion piece in the Guardian. “Most public health advocates will welcome this decision, although inevitably some will argue that seven months of preparation is unnecessary. We are relieved that, at last, pill testing is finally moving from debate to policy to practical on-the-ground interventions.” Matthew W. Johnson, one of the authors of the recent U.S. testing study and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, acknowledged in a statement that there is ongoing debate over the legality and value of pill-testing services but that they deserve a closer look. “People would be safest not taking any street drugs at all, but if free, no-fault testing can reduce deaths and other catastrophic consequences, it may be a service worth having,” Johnson said.

Update: On Saturday, additional tests from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation failed to detect THC in the community water supply. The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office now believes the test kits used earlier showed false positives. The original story is below: The tests found something fishy in the water. In the small town of Hugo, Colo., the water coursing through public pipes, officials say, has been tainted by THC. THC, as you may know, is the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. On Thursday afternoon, authorities notified the town of about 800 people that the water should not be drunk, used to cook with or even to bathe. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment later downgraded the warning — it was safe to shower, brush teeth and do laundry with the tap water. Ingestion remained inadvisable as of late Thursday, though by Saturday the water advisory was canceled due to the lack of further evidence. There have not been reports of health issues linked to Hugo’s water, according to an AP report on Friday. Nor did every Colorado local seem terribly distraught by the idea of a cool glass of THC. “I might have to go drink some water,” Patsie Smith, the former mayor of Hugo, quipped to the Denver Post. But investigators view the situation differently. The incident is being handled with “an abundance of caution,” as Capt. Michael Yowell of the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office said in a news conference Thursday. The THC was first identified in a vial of tap water meant to serve as a negative result in a drug test. “However, when that water was tested, a positive indicator for THC was detected,” Yowell said, via KDVR. The sheriff’s office had tweeted earlier that the tests “began after complaints.” The office did not respond to a phone call  from The Washington Post late Thursday seeking clarification. Perplexed by the discovery of THC, officials began examining Hugo’s wells. Town employees, local Fox outlet KDVR reported, discovered that one of the well houses showed signs of a forced entry. Subsequent field tests detected THC in a handful of locations, though the health department does not currently have “reliable information” on the THC concentrations. Officials sealed the well in question. It will take 48 hours to flush all of that well’s water through the system, Yowell said. In the meantime, the county provided bottled water to residents. Hovering over the town like a hazy cloud is the mystery of why the tests found THC — or who might have broken into the water supply. It is legal to possess small amounts of marijuana in Colorado. But unlike Denver and other Colorado municipalities, Hugo does not allow the sale of marijuana. Nor are there any legal marijuana grow operations nearby. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation and the FBI have joined the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office in an attempt to trace the THC taint to the source. Some chemists, however, are skeptical that there is a psychoactive compound floating through Hugo’s water system. “There is zero possibility that there’s anything like THC in the Hugo water,” Peter Perrone, owner of Gobi Analytical, told the Denver Post. Gobi Analytical is a Colorado-based recreational marijuana testing facility and the first state-approved lab of its kind. “The amount of THC required would have to be financially ludicrous for anyone to do this as a practical joke,” said Dan Burgard, a chemist at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash., by phone to The Washington Post. Burgard is currently studying THC traces in Washington wastewater. He does not believe that the Hugo contamination, if it exists, could stem from raw vegetable matter. Unless marijuana is smoked or cooked, the plants are not psychoactive. “It’s probably a false positive from the test kit, that would be my gut,” he said. Water systems have been tainted with drugs before, though most environmental concerns are about incidental exposure. Metabolized amphetamines and other ADHD medications may spike in the sewage systems of college campuses during finals season, as Burgard and his colleagues reported in April 2013. Scientists have also detected ecstasy in rivers after music festivals. But because those substances exist primarily on the back end of the sanitation cycle, such discoveries may be bad news for fish, though less threatening to humans drinking stuff that comes from a faucet. To spike tap water with THC, a culprit would first have to dissolve the chemical. Perrone’s skepticism is based on a property known as solubility. Like oil, THC does not easily dissolve in water. In fact, overcoming THC’s poor solubility has posed a bit of a scientific boondoggle for pharmaceutical researchers. As British and American scientists wrote in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in 2006, even when THC is liquefied with a detergent, it is likely to precipitate — that is, undo all the hard work of dissolving and form clumps — “if care is not exercised.” That said, novelty marijuana drinks exist. Manufacturers rely on a technical extraction process, however, to produce the liquid THC. Even then, the drinks are not typically super-potent. Mirth Provisions, a company in Washington state, offers a soda called Legal. It contains some 20 milligrams of THC per an 11.5-ounce bottle. That’s “enough to know that you’re high, but not so much as to overwhelm,” Adam Stites, founder of Mirth Provisions, told the Huffington Post in 2014. It does not appear that anyone, including the thirstiest residents of Hugo, is in danger of being overwhelmed. In a statement, Lincoln County Health Officer John Fox warned locals about symptoms of “marijuana excess,” including hallucinations, vomiting, elevated heart rate and paranoia, among other ill effects. But, he pointed out: “It would take more product than any of us could afford to contaminate a city water supply to the extent that people would suffer any effects.”	172	"[{""start"": 3939, ""end"": 4118, ""text"": ""Metabolized amphetamines and other ADHD medications may spike in the sewage systems of college campuses during finals season, as Burgard and his colleagues reported in April 2013."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	182	2023-03-23T09:25:50.793375Z	2023-03-23T09:25:50.793480Z	817.797
"It turns out that massive music festivals might not just be a noise disruption for locals -- they might be causing issues for nearby aquatic life, too. According to a study published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, these events could be introducing dangerous drugs like ecstasy and ketamine into the water supply, leaving traces of them in rivers and soil. The study is part of an effort to research so-called ""emerging contaminants,"" (ECs) or things like drugs (both prescribed and recreational) and hygiene products that end up in waste water. According to recent studies, only about half of these contaminants are actually removed during the water treatment process. So eventually, they can end up back in our drinking water -- and in our fish. Researchers were particularly interested in how certain events -- like football games, holiday weekends, and tourist attractions -- could cause spikes or even changes in these sneaky contaminants. After all, it stands to reason that an influx of people (especially a large group all doing the same activity) would have an effect. The researchers measured contaminant levels in Hengchun, a popular vacation destination in Taiwan. ECs were higher in Hengchun rivers than in other areas, despite the low population of the town. That wasn't unexpected -- since the area is popular with tourists, it often has extra people hanging around flushing their waste. These areas also showed a lower concentration of illicit drugs. So the researchers also weren't surprised that contaminants spiked during popular travel times, like weekends and seasons with good weather. But during the ""Spring Scream,"" an event that draws over 600,000 young music fans to the beach town, things got a little crazy. Daily sampling during the week of Spring Scream found big spikes in drugs like ecstasy, ketamine, and caffeine -- exactly the cocktail of ""fun"" drugs one would expect hoards of young music festival goers to partake in. Meanwhile, more benign drugs -- like ibuprofen -- were fairly consistent before, during, and after the concerts. This isn't the first indication that sewage can be affected by one-off events. Studies of water near universities have found spikes in amphetamine (taken illicitly by many students to enhance their studying) during exam periods, for example. Another study found that levels of party drugs like cocaine and ecstasy spike in the London area on weekends. It's not as if going for a swim in this water could get you high. But the concern is that people and animals are being exposed to varying mixtures of different drugs at different concentrations -- so it's hard to guess just what the long-term effects might be. And research has indicated that some of the drugs that change behavior in humans might also change the behavior of aquatic animals exposed to them, so this party drug pollution is something that warrants a closer look."	171	"[{""start"": 244, ""end"": 385, ""text"": ""these events could be introducing dangerous drugs like ecstasy and ketamine into the water supply, leaving traces of them in rivers and soil."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 575, ""end"": 775, ""text"": ""According to recent studies, only about half of these contaminants are actually removed during the water treatment process.
