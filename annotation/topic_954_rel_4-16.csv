ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — From a collection of modest offices in a half-empty high rise, one of Ethiopia’s most prominent journalists publishes his weekly paper with a staff of just four. The country has imprisoned U.S.-educated Eskinder Nega multiple times, most recently for six years. But under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government, he and some dozen other jailed journalists have been released and are free to write. His new weekly Ethiopis takes a strident tone, especially against the city administration and activists from Ethiopia’s Oromo ethnic group, newly empowered by their fellow Oromo, Abiy. He sees his paper and his activism as part of his long struggle for democracy. Others see it as a danger to Ethiopia’s delicate political state and as part of a wave of news outlets that are taking sides and worsening tensions in the country’s many conflicts. “Who’s to say what is extreme?” Eskinder said from his tiny office, adorned with portraits of the Virgin Mary and an Ethio­pian emperor known for uniting the country. “Do we have a consensus on what extreme is?” After becoming prime minister a year ago, Abiy embarked on reforms that brought home exiled politicians and armed opposition groups, freed political prisoners, made peace with Eritrea and opened up a heavily restricted media sector. Ethiopia has been a rare bright spot of increased rights and democracy on a continent more known for leaders overstaying their mandates. Its progress in media freedom — there are no longer any imprisoned journalists — has been so dramatic that it was chosen to host World Press Freedom Day next month. The changes have also prompted conflicts and unearthed long-buried grievances, often revolving around land and ethnicity. To many, a newly polarized press is making things worse. “It’s a familiar story to what we’ve seen in other countries undergoing a rapid and messy democratization, and it will require a massive effort to ensure that high-quality journalism and civic dialogue prevails without compromising freedom of expression,” said Nicholas Benequista of the Washington-based Center for International Media Assistance. In the 2019 World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, Ethi­o­pia rose 40 places, from 150 out of 180 countries to 110 — the biggest improvement this year in any country. Next year, Ethi­o­pia will hold its first free elections in 15 years, and there are fears that the toxic media environment could lead to violence. “This opening up is sort of an ultimate test for us, and we are failing it, I’m afraid,” said Tsedale Lemma, editor of the English-language Addis Standard. “That is damaging, not just to the industry, not just media, but to the social cohesion in a country that’s deeply polarized, ethnicized and going through a fragile moment of transition.” She said the extreme views that had long proliferated on social media, especially among Ethiopians living abroad, are being reflected in the news media. In a recent issue of Eskinder’s weekly Ethiopis, a front-page article accused Oromo politician Bekele Gerba, also recently freed from prison, of promoting ethnic cleansing because of a speech he made encouraging the use of the Oromo language. The article compared young Oromo activists to perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, suggesting that Oromos could carry out similar atrocities. While there have been outbreaks of ethnic-related violence and displacement recently in the country, there has been nothing on the level of what happened in Rwanda 25 years ago. Other articles in Ethiopis accuse the city government of giving ID cards only to people of the Oromo ethnicity or evicting only non-Oromos from their homes — charges repeatedly denied by municipal authorities. The cover of a recent issue of Habesha Weg, another weekly, claimed that Oromo activist Jawar Mohammed had encouraged Oromos to launch a “Islamist militant war” against the rest of the country. There is no evidence that he has done so. “I think you could argue that part of this is inevitable, people were not free to openly express themselves for many years, now they are and it’s this cathartic release of anger and frustration,” said Felix Horne, senior researcher on Ethiopia for Human Rights Watch. “And in many cases that release is happening in a complete security void, there’s no limits in what people are able to say, so that’s a big problem.” The prime minister himself has expressed a degree of frustration over the press freedoms that he has allowed, noting once that everyone in the country seemed to be an activist rather than a worker in a profession. Billene Seyoum, the prime minister’s spokeswoman, said in response to emailed questions that “the government remains committed to opening up of the media space as part of its democratization process.” The government has also announced plans to professionalize the state media, which under previous regimes was a propaganda organ trumpeting the government’s achievements. So far, though, the official media has largely continued to reflect the government’s views. In the case of the Oromo regional broadcaster, Oromia Broadcasting Network, efforts to make it more independent ran into opposition from local politicians. Mohammed Ademo, who worked as a journalist in the United States, accepted a job with the broadcaster with a mandate to turn it into something like NPR. A few months later, however, he was pushed out. “There were people who felt we were bringing about these changes too fast, and they also felt they couldn’t take full advantage of having a regional broadcaster,” he said, expressing doubt about the commitment to restructure the state media. According to the broadcaster, Mohammed was offered a better position at the Foreign Ministry. Stemming the tide of hate in the media while not restricting it is one of the government’s big challenges. There are two laws being drafted: one to regulate media and the other to combat fake news and hate speech. The latter has set off alarm bells, with many worrying that an overly stringent hate-speech law might be used to curb the nascent press. Billene said the government is aware of those concerns. “In defining what constitutes hateful speech, the law would ensure that the definition is precise, clear and narrow to ensure that it does not burden freedoms of speech,” she said, adding that it was also up to the people to become more discerning and hold media “accountable to higher standards of reporting.” That might be slowly happening. As opposition media outlets have returned to the country after fleeing it under the previous regime, their reporting has in some cases mellowed, said Zecharias Zelalem, an Ethiopian journalist and commentator based in Canada. “Ethiopians will start to demand more from their media outlets. The ones that we have currently are going to have to change their approach, are going to have to be less focused on propaganda, rebuttals and vitriol, and they are going to have to up their game,” he said. “They will have to cater to an audience that shares the same taxis as them, that shares the same sidewalks as them, that walks the same streets as them.” paul.schemm@washpost.com	823	"[{""start"": 1080, ""end"": 1312, ""text"": ""After becoming prime minister a year ago, Abiy embarked on reforms that brought home exiled politicians and armed opposition groups, freed political prisoners, made peace with Eritrea and opened up a heavily restricted media sector."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1450, ""end"": 1614, ""text"": ""Its progress in media freedom — there are no longer any imprisoned journalists — has been so dramatic that it was chosen to host World Press Freedom Day next month."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2142, ""end"": 2334, ""text"": ""In the 2019 World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, Ethi­o­pia rose 40 places, from 150 out of 180 countries to 110 — the biggest improvement this year in any country."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	801	2023-04-28T15:02:55.041320Z	2023-04-28T15:02:55.041431Z	414.829
ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — Ethiopia’s reformist prime minister announced Tuesday a new cabinet that is half female, in an unprecedented push for gender parity in Africa’s second-most-populous nation. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has marked his nearly seven months in office with staggering reforms for this once authoritarian country, notably releasing thousands of political prisoners, making peace with Ethiopia’s main enemy, Eritrea, and promising to open up the economy. The new cabinet, which reduces ministerial positions from 28 to 20, has women in the top security posts for the first time in Ethiopia’s history. Aisha Mohammed will be in charge of defense, and Muferiat Kamil, a former parliamentary speaker, will head the newly formed Ministry of Peace. In some ways, this could be one of the most important ministries in the government, though its name has garnered a degree of criticism on social media for its Orwellian sound. It oversees the federal police, the intelligence services and the information security agency, and it will take the lead in tackling much of the ethnic unrest that has swept the countryside since Abiy’s reforms. “Our women ministers will disprove the adage that women can’t lead,” Abiy said in Parliament. Although women have been in the cabinet before, they often held minor positions. In the new cabinet, in addition to defense and security, women will head the ministries of trade, transport and labor, as well as culture, science and revenue. Awol Allo, an expert on Ethi­o­pia at Britain’s Keele University, said this was especially important because the lack of gender equality is a persistent problem in the country, which has strong patriarchal traditions. “It is a very important and progressive move on the part of the prime minister and very consistent with the transformative agendas he’s been pursuing,” Allo said. “I also think it sends a strong message to young Ethio­pian women that one day they can take up positions in the government.” Also represented in the new cabinet are often marginalized ethnic groups. A diverse nation of about 80 ethnicities, Ethi­o­pia has long been dominated by just a few groups. Aisha, the new defense minister, comes from the arid and predominantly Muslim Afar region, while Finance Minister Ahmed Shide is from the Somali region. Hallelujah Lulie, an analyst based in Addis Ababa, pointed out the presence in the cabinet of two Muslim women who wear headscarves, an important inclusion in a country that is one-third Muslim. “Muslims were historically underrepresented,” he said. “It is a good move. It projects a good image. It’s inspiring in many ways.” While much depends on how the new cabinet will tackle the country’s many challenges, including job creation for an overwhelmingly young population and a difficult transition away from an authoritarian system, Hallelujah predicted that the new cabinet would calm tensions and set an important precedent. Abiy was elected by the ruling party after years of anti-government protests shook the country. He immediately embarked on reforms and has promised free and competitive elections in 2020. The ruling party currently holds all the seats in Parliament. The transition has not been easy. In the past year alone, ethnic strife has displaced 1.4 million people as old scores were being settled amid a security vacuum. In many parts of the country, the struggle against the previous regime left government structures weak or nonexistent, making it difficult to enforce the rule of law. The once repressive police and army, which had operated with impunity, also have been struggling to determine their roles in the new environment. “The state is still functioning in the hangover of an authoritarian regime,” Hallelujah said. “The army and the federal police are still having a hard time finding that balance and equilibrium between enforcing the law and respecting human rights.” The country got a scare on Oct. 10 when 240 armed soldiers marched up to the prime minister’s residence demanding pay raises and provoking fears of a coup. In the end, they were invited inside — without their weapons — and were met by top officials, including Abiy, a former military man, who then did push-ups with the soldiers. “Democracy is an existential issue for Ethi­o­pia. There is no option but multi-partyism,” Abiy said in an interview published Tuesday. “Inclusiveness and coexistence is critical in Ethiopia because of differences in terms of tribalism, and religion and the virtually feudal system of land ownership which prevailed in the past,” he said. paul.schemm@washpost.com	822	"[{""start"": 199, ""end"": 469, ""text"": ""Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has marked his nearly seven months in office with staggering reforms for this once authoritarian country, notably releasing thousands of political prisoners, making peace with Ethiopia’s main enemy, Eritrea, and promising to open up the economy"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2945, ""end"": 3132, ""text"": ""Abiy was elected by the ruling party after years of anti-government protests shook the country.

JIMMA, Ethiopia — On a busy back street in the hometown of Ethiopia's prime minister, Nobel Prize-winner Abiy Ahmed, two men sipping coffee and chewing khat tried out a new pastime: having a heated political disagreement in public. Africa’s second-most-populous country is heading into its first multiparty campaign season after Abiy lifted a ban on opposition parties, dissolved his ruling party that controlled life here with an iron fist for nearly three decades and scheduled elections for August. Abiy’s promise to transform Ethiopia into a full-fledged democracy has earned him widespread praise abroad — and is why some Ethiopians aren’t as worried as they once were that speaking critically of the government could lead to a knock on their door by the intelligence services. But the openness has also laid bare a deeply polarized country, riven by political and ethnic rivalries entrenched by Abiy’s predecessors. Rather than uniting the country, democratic politics could derail violently right at their outset in Ethiopia, especially if Abiy’s government denies the opposition space to campaign openly. The elections are a high-stakes gamble for Ethiopia’s future. Despite widespread poverty, unemployment and ethnic violence that has uprooted millions from their homes, Ethi­o­pia remains stable enough to broker regional peace agreements — including with neighboring Eritrea — and Abiy’s promise of new economic policies has landed the country billions of promised dollars in foreign loans and investment. Major political violence would scuttle those ambitions. In an attempt to preempt such violence, officials say, the government has begun to dispatch security forces to clamp down on opposition gatherings and restrict Internet service, phone access and physical movement across a vast opposition stronghold where people have been detained in droves and some killed in custody. Critics see the makings of a crackdown on dissent. Rights groups and journalists have reported cases of arrests and disappearances of vocal opposition leaders and supporters. In speeches, Abiy has forcefully rejected ethnic politics and re-christened his party the Prosperity Party — an anomaly in a sea of coalition and opposition members whose names explicitly denote ethnicity. (Ethiopia is split into nine semiautonomous ethnic regions.) The power of the Prosperity Party “in the coming election will draw on the fear of ethno-nationalism, for people’s personal well-being — and even the survival of the nation,” said Abel Abate, an Ethiopian political analyst. “But there is lots of nervousness, lots of tension, lots of suspicion toward the PP from all corners of the country.” Abiy’s platform is particularly unpopular in two ethnic regions: Tigray, in the far north, where power was centered during previous governments before he wrested it away; and his own Oromia, home to the country’s biggest group, the Oromo, who make up at least a third of the national population and whose ethno-nationalist leaders helped Abiy gain power but now want Oromo interests to be put first. Sitting across from each other on this back street in one of Oromia’s largest market towns, Hassen Mohammed Isa, 30, and Isak Macha, 35, enacted a two-man version of Ethiopia’s national political debate. “Abiy’s ideas are great, but we see that he is surrounded by chameleons of the past regime,” said Isak, who, like an enormous but uncounted percentage of Ethiopians, is unemployed. He gets jobs unloading trucks every once in a while but relies mostly on the largesse of family and friends. He supports an Oromo nationalist party that promises to bring wealth back to Oromo areas that its leaders say was hogged by smaller but more powerful ethnic groups under the previous government. Hassen is a rare success story in Jimma and holds a degree in laboratory technology. He supports Abiy’s vision of an Ethiopia in which national identity comes before ethnic identity. “The way [Isak] is thinking — you see, most people in Ethiopia haven’t even passed class eight in school. That is why when you let these groups operate freely, ethnic politics becomes bigger than ever. Every perceived insult raises the possibility of a riot, and every riot can start a war,” he said. “Friend, this is a country where most people have nothing, absolutely nothing,” Isak shot back. “Only when we figure out today, then we think about tomorrow. How do we get the best tomorrow? We are ready to believe anything. I want to live a life just like you.” Both the ruling party and the opposition will have to rely on coalitions of ethnic parties to prevail in the election. But while the Prosperity Party has a unifying figure in Abiy, the opposition is more scattered. Jawar Mohammed, an Oromo media baron who spent years in exile in Minnesota before Abiy came to power, recently returned and is fashioning himself as Abiy’s main foe — though he has not publicly announced his candidacy and has been locked in battle with the government to recognize his Ethiopian citizenship after he said he renounced his U.S. citizenship. His supporters are deeply devoted to him, and when security forces tried to arrest him in October, riots broke out that resulted in almost 100 deaths. That spark looks likely to be ignited again and again over the course of the campaign season, but Jawar says he preaches nonviolence to his supporters and claims clashes have been instigated only by security forces under Abiy’s orders. “If the army is deployed, there will be blood. And that, well, it comes down to Abiy. If there is violence, it will begin at his command,” Jawar said on a recent Sunday at his residence in the capital, Addis Ababa, where he ate a meal of injera and lentils while scrolling through Facebook, where his Oromia Media Network has more than 1 million followers. Jawar’s anti-Abiy argument has gained steam among new supporters because local officials from the ruling party have prevented his Oromo Federalist Congress party from holding numerous public meetings. Last month in Jimma, for instance, the opposition party was denied permission to use a stadium for a rally on the grounds that the campaign season hadn’t officially begun, but then the Prosperity Party was allowed to hold a rally in the middle of town on the same day. “They brought oil, sugar, T-shirts and had a rally on the same day we had requested ours,” said Samira Kamil, a local Oromo Federalist Congress leader. “Preaching democracy but being a dictator — that’s Abiy for you. We’re not even able to introduce ourselves to the people, and this election is meant to be free?” In the days after the rally, she said, she began getting phone calls from unknown numbers — raspy voices issuing veiled threats — and was followed on the street by suspicious men. She was arrested Feb. 26, charged with “disrupting a meeting” and released on bail two days later in what she said was an attempt to intimidate her. Taye Dendea, spokesman for the Prosperity Party in Oromia, said that the Oromo Federalist Congress was denied permission for a meeting in part because they “engaged in inciting conflict, saying that if they win, they would retaliate the previous misdeeds.” He also said that the Prosperity Party had not organized its own rally but that supporters of Abiy had come out onto the streets on their own volition. Abiy and Jawar were once friends and worked together to usher out Ethiopia’s old political guard and build the cornerstones of democracy. Now Jawar says Abiy is a would-be authoritarian. “I came to the opposition side not to create chaos,” Jawar said, “but to make them competitive, to make the election a real election, to make Abiy feel like he has to run for the money.” The concern over deepening ethnic divides seems to portend a future at odds with the plaudits Abiy received after initiating his raft of policy changes. “The government will apparently continue to do what it has done in the past: restrict public space while allowing the ruling party to use them abundantly,” said Abate, the analyst. “Instead of an opening of political space, it may ultimately be a narrowing.” max.bearak@washpost.com	820	"[{""start"": 502, ""end"": 608, ""text"": ""Abiy’s promise to transform Ethiopia into a full-fledged democracy has earned him widespread praise abroad"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	798	2023-04-28T14:55:19.956949Z	2023-04-28T14:55:19.957018Z	6.447
ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — When Daniel Gayem’s father in Ethiopia wanted to talk to his brother in neighboring Eritrea, they would set up a conference call through Daniel — who lived in Las Vegas. The two brothers were born in Eritrea when it was a province of Ethiopia and had long ago moved to the capital Addis Ababa, but when the two countries fell out in 1998, the brother and the rest of their family were deported, along with 70,000 others of Eritrean origin. Daniel’s father, who was married to an Ethiopian, was allowed to stay in Addis Ababa. All communication and transportation links were cut between the two countries, and families were cleaved in half. Contact was limited to occasional rushed third-party phone calls or arduous trips through neighboring countries. Daniel’s father has yet to visit the grave of his mother, Daniel’s grandmother, who died five years ago in Eritrea. With a startling suddenness, however, this long separation has come to end after the signing of a peace agreement on Monday between Ethiopia’s reformist prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, and Eritrea’s longtime president, Isaias Afwerki. The five-point declaration ended the state of war and promised to restore trade, transport and telecommunication links and reopen embassies. Soon afterward, Ethiopian Airlines announced that flights to Eritrea’s capital, Asmara, would resume on July 18. Ethiopians and Eritreans could obtain visas on arrival, in stark contrast with what before had been a very difficult process. On Saturday, Isaias will arrive in Ethi­o­pia for an unprecedented three-day visit. Some Ethiopians were so excited to reach out to their long-estranged neighbors that they just started dialing numbers. “Oh Gosh, I am so excited over this EthioEritrea thingy, I just called on a random number in Asmara and had a nice chat with a lady named Frtuna,” said one of the many users of social media taking advantage of the new service. The stunning turnabout — a rare bit of conflict-free good news for the African continent — came about through long-standing efforts by regional countries and the exit of Isaias’s longtime rivals in Ethiopia. Eritrea’s information minister, Yemane Gebremeskel, described the changes as “driving on the fast lane for peace and cooperation” as he tweeted a picture of a butterfly in the colors of the nations’ flags. But as Kjetil Tronvoll, an expert on the conflict from Oslo’s Bjorknes University College, warns, much of what has been agreed to has been “low hanging,” and thorny issues remain. “This has been done in a remarkably quick manner, which indicates growing mutual trust between the two government leaders,” Tronvoll said. “But the difficult issues, which were the triggering factors to the war, lie ahead — trade and tariff regimes, as well as currency conversion.” The change in rhetoric has been dramatic, with both countries’ media celebrating the rapprochement; just a few months ago, they were demonizing each other. “It seems like it’s a dream,” said Amleset Araya, who was born near Asmara but grew up in Addis Ababa until the war broke out in 1998. “You never hear anything positive. You think one day God will do something. But this fast? The changes came so fast, it is amazing. Many people are happy. It is like a dream.” She still remembers how people were forced out of homes they had grown up in. “There was no time to pack to get ready,”she recalled. “Sometimes just one member of the family was forced to leave. The rest stayed. The dad or mom had to go alone, or the children stayed with one parent.” Eventually she moved to Canada. Her son, Zecharias Zelalem, a journalist and blogger who writes from Canada, described how only a few months ago, something as simple as a wedding for a family divided between two warring countries was a major logistical undertaking. “For her parents to show up at the wedding, they had to leave Eritrea by way of Sudan, on a bus, and from Sudan, another bus to Ethiopia, which takes two to three days,” he said. Now Ethiopian Airlines says the flight will take just over an hour. Daniel, 36, who now lives in Addis Ababa, mused at how much more accessible whole branches of the family are. “I don’t even know what they look like,” he said. He could call them now — if only he knew how. “We haven’t talked to that side of the family for so long, we don’t even know their phone numbers,” he said. “That’s how bad it is.” Of course, there are many Eritreans living in Ethiopia who are uniquely affected by these developments — the refugees. There are more than 160,000 Eritreans registered as refugees with the United Nations who are living in Ethiopia, often after fleeing compulsory military service. Thousands more come every month. Many try to find their way to Europe, while others live in Addis Ababa, where they hope the peace will also bring changes to the government, which has been criticized by international rights groups. “They are happy [about the peace], but they don’t want to go back there,” said Daniel, who has many friends in Addis Ababa who recently left Eritrea. “They would love to go back to see their family if they won’t be captured, if they have the freedom to leave the country again.” An estimated 70,000 people died during the two-year war. After the conflict, Eritrea remained on a war footing to confront its massive neighbor, which has 20 times the population. The demobilization of this army and the final demarcation of the border will be part of the delicate negotiations to finalize the peace deal. But Tronvoll, who has been studying Eritrea since the 1980s, said that such change could threaten Isaias’s grip on power, which dates to 1991. “It seems unlikely that his regime will last long if he liberalizes, demobilizes the army and accepts the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees,” he said. Instead, he said, Isaias might look for incremental changes. But those small measures will still mean a huge amount for countless families. “With the way things are going now, I will soon go see the rest of my family — I’m really looking forward to it,” Daniel said. “And I can see my grandmother’s grave, uncle’s grave. I haven’t seen my grandmother since I was a kid.” paul.schemm@washpost.com	819	"[{""start"": 1126, ""end"": 1379, ""text"": ""The five-point declaration ended the state of war and promised to restore trade, transport and telecommunication links and reopen embassies.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethio­pian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed traveled Sunday to Eritrea, once a bitter adversary, and agreed to normalize ties after an unprecedented summit. The rapprochement between the two neighbors could have far-reaching consequences for improving the stability of the Horn of Africa, which is home to several conflicts and environmental crises. The two nations, sworn enemies for two decades, fought a brutal war from 1998 to 2000 in which at least 70,000 people were killed. In the intervening years, the two sides have clashed repeatedly and supported rival rebel movements. Abiy was hugged by Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki at the airport in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and they smiled and laughed as they strode past a uniformed band and honor guard. The friendly welcome set the tone for the visit; the two men were shown several times on Eritrean state television smiling together before announcing at an evening banquet that relations will be normalized. The two countries will reopen embassies, restore flight links and allow direct telephone calls. Landlocked Ethi­o­pia will look to start using Eritrea’s Red Sea ports. “We have agreed to open up embassies in our respective countries, allow our people to visit each other’s cities, and allow our airlines and ports to operate freely,” Abiy said. “Love is greater than modern weapons like tanks and missiles. Love can win hearts, and we have seen a great deal of it today here in Asmara.” Abiy, who came to power in April and has already turned Ethiopia’s stagnant political scene on its head, has frequently preached about love and unity in his speeches in Ethi­o­pia. The convoy of vehicles that carried him from the airport through downtown Asmara was swamped by loudly cheering crowds that spilled onto the road and slowed the cars to a crawl. “Peace is everything; it is health, development, education,” an elderly man wearing a turban and sunglasses told Eritrean state television the morning of the visit. “Everyone in the world loves peace.” “The Eritrean people have today got the chance to express their true love and emotion for Ethiopians,” Isaias said at the evening banquet, according to news agencies. “We can imagine that the decision the prime minister of Ethiopia took was not a simple one. But we can assure you we will face the future together. We will work as one.” The change in relations has stunned observers. Hallelujah Lulie, a political analyst specializing in the Horn of Africa, said the two countries had come to the realization that the status quo — no war, no peace — could not continue. As Eritrea’s relations with the West and Arab countries improved, it also became more open to rapprochement. In Ethi­o­pia, the accession of Abiy, who represented a break from the party that conducted the war with Eritrea, also made it easier to find an end to the stalemate. Hallelujah added that mediation over the past month by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have increasingly close ties to Eritrea, probably helped create the breakthrough. “It will radically redraw the geopolitical map of the Horn of Africa and East Africa,” he said. “The rivalry between Ethi­o­pia and Eritrea was reflected in conflicts in South Sudan, Somalia, even sometimes up to Chad.” Nearly 30 years ago, when Eritrea was a province of Ethi­o­pia, the future leaders of the two countries were comrades in the struggle against Ethiopia’s communist dictatorship. But after the overthrow of the dictatorship and Eritrea’s declaration of independence, relations soured despite close cultural and linguistic ties. Abiy broke the deadlock between the two countries June 5 by accepting the 2000 peace agreement that ended the war, which would involve ceding territory still held by Ethi­o­pia. Events moved quickly after that, with Isaias accepting Abiy’s overtures as a “positive” move and sending a delegation led by his foreign minister to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, a week later. The normalization of ties notwithstanding, the complex process of returning disputed territory and figuring out what happens to the people living there lies ahead. Under Abiy, Ethi­o­pia appears to be embarking on a path of reform, but Eritrea has been characterized as one of the most authoritarian and closed states in Africa. For much of the past 20 years, Eritrea has been focused on its conflict with Ethi­o­pia, with substantial spending on its military and indefinite mandatory military service that has led hundreds of thousands of Eritreans to try to immigrate to Europe. The end of the conflict could open the way not only for the end of mandatory conscription in Eritrea but also a return to democratic provisions in the constitution that were suspended, including elections. “There won’t be radical change, but some reforms could be on the horizon,” Hallelujah said. paul.schemm@washpost.com	818	"[{""start"": 24, ""end"": 172, ""text"": ""Ethio­pian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed traveled Sunday to Eritrea, once a bitter adversary, and agreed to normalize ties after an unprecedented summit"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 174, ""end"": 365, ""text"": ""he rapprochement between the two neighbors could have far-reaching consequences for improving the stability of the Horn of Africa, which is home to several conflicts and environmental crise"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 599, ""end"": 781, ""text"": ""Abiy was hugged by Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki at the airport in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and they smiled and laughed as they strode past a uniformed band and honor guard."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1157, ""end"": 1333, ""text"": ""“We have agreed to open up embassies in our respective countries, allow our people to visit each other’s cities, and allow our airlines and ports to operate freely,” Abiy said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 782, ""end"": 988, ""text"": ""he friendly welcome set the tone for the visit; the two men were shown several times on Eritrean state television smiling together before announcing at an evening banquet that relations will be normalized."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1473, ""end"": 1834, ""text"": ""” Abiy, who came to power in April and has already turned Ethiopia’s stagnant political scene on its head, has frequently preached about love and unity in his speeches in Ethi­o­pia.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — In Ethiopia’s latest move to empower women, the country’s Parliament on Thursday installed as Supreme Court president a women’s rights activist whose achievements were championed in a movie promoted by Hollywood star Angelina Jolie. Meaza Ashenafi was a judge on Ethiopia’s High Court from 1989 to 1992 and then an adviser to a commission writing up its new constitution. She also founded the Ethio­pian Women Lawyers Association and helped start the first women’s bank in the country, Enat Bank. Her most famous case, however, was turned into the 2014 Ethio­pian film “Difret,” which was promoted by Jolie as executive producer and went on to win the World Cinema Dramatic Audience Award at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. The film is based on a court case, tried by Meaza, that resulted in outlawing the tradition of kidnapping girls to be forced into marriage in Ethio­pia. In 1996, Aberash Bekele, 14, was kidnapped on her way home from school by a man who intended to marry her. She escaped with a rifle and shot her kidnapper. She was then charged with murder. Meaza succeeded in getting the charges dropped and set off a public debate over Ethiopia’s age-old tradition of kidnapping for marriage. Meaza was selected to head the court by Ethiopia’s new reformist prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who has taken measures to increase the role of women in what is widely described as a patriarchal society. In presenting her to Parliament, Abiy said she would improve the court’s ability to implement reform in the country and the demands of justice and democracy. “I have made the nomination with the firm belief that she has the capacity required, with her vast international experience in mind,” he said, according to the Reuters news agency. Parliament approved the nomination unanimously. On Oct. 16, Abiy reshuffled his cabinet and, in an unprecedented move, named women to half the ministerial posts. Women now hold key portfolios such as defense and internal security. The following week, he nominated the country’s first female president. The prime minister’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, described Meaza as one of the country’s “most seasoned lawyers.” “She brings a track record of competence and relevant experience to the role,” he said in a tweet. Although activists say that Ethi­o­pia still has a long way to go and that women would struggle to overcome prejudices to get elected to office, these moves set important examples for young women. While equal rights is enshrined in Ethio­pian law, and there are national strategies to promote gender equality, women in the country suffer from discrimination, gender-based violence and unequal access to education, especially to secondary schools. Underage marriage is also common in the countryside, where the majority of Ethiopians live. Since coming to power in April, Abiy has undertaken several reforms, notably releasing thousands of political prisoners, inviting back exiled opposition leaders and pledging to open up the economy. paul.schemm@washpost.com	816	"[{""start"": 1818, ""end"": 2071, ""text"": ""On Oct. 16, Abiy reshuffled his cabinet and, in an unprecedented move, named women to half the ministerial posts.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for “his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighboring Eritrea.” Abiy’s peacemaking efforts have produced limited results, however. Abiy Ahmed’s approach to peacemaking The roots to Abiy’s success and failures are rooted in his framing of Ethiopia’s political conflicts as emanating from a particular political culture of intolerance. His solution to these conflicts is a philosophy he calls Medemer (“synergy” in Amharic), which centers on the need to change societal norms. Abiy’s olive branch diplomacy has to be understood in the context of this broader norm-changing project. Medemer — although a highly vague concept — has involved inculcating values such as tolerance, forgiveness and civic duty into the population through practices such as public dialogues and nationwide street cleanup campaigns. Abiy has also tried to transform the public image of the leader in Ethiopia by projecting an image of a prime minister that is humble and not feared. The model doesn’t see class, nationalist and other contradictions as inherent to politics. Instead Abiy’s approach seeks to depoliticize social cleavages and focus on norms that govern individual behavior, such as tolerance and civility. This framing of politics led to an approach to peacemaking in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa that centered on the national leader making symbolic overtures to domestic and foreign rivals to establish trust. He broke a 20-year stalemate with Eritrea Abiy’s first overture was to his former mentors-cum-nemesis, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). In a radical departure from Ethiopian political tradition and practice, he initially reached out to his rivals in the security establishment, allowing those who were willing, such as military chief of staff Samora Yunis, to resign gracefully and with amnesty, while maintaining people like Arkebe Oqubay in advisory roles. Abiy allegedly offered the same amnesty to intelligence chief Getachew Assefa but was rejected. For more than two years Abiy’s Oromo Democratic Party and the security establishment had unofficially been at war with each other over the terms of the reform process. Abiy attained international praise, however, through the olive branch he extended to Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Ethiopia and Eritrea ended their two-year border war — responsible for almost 100,000 casualties — with a cease-fire in 2000. The two neighbors could not agree on the terms to normalize their relations, however, and continued the war through proxies until 2018. Abiy’s ability to break a 20-year stalemate between Ethiopia and Eritrea did lend credence to the idea that the source of conflict in the Horn of Africa had been the inability of leaders to show goodwill, a positive attitude and trust — rather than the view that attributes conflict to incompatible values and interests. The pace of the rapprochement and highly emotional scenes of families reuniting after decades of separation further consolidated Abiy’s success. Abiy’s next move was a peace offering to exiled armed opposition groups. Notable among these were the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), Ginbot 7 (G7) and Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), which had been conducting an insurgency from neighboring Eritrea. As a goodwill gesture Abiy’s government allowed these groups back into Ethiopia — with their arms intact and without any vetting process. Many of these overtures fell short of expectations TPLF veterans rejected Abiy’s offer and immediately began a propaganda war to undermine his reform plan. Then the OLF rebels refused to disarm and within a few months began an insurgency against Abiy’s government. As these gestures backfired, Abiy increasingly resorted to the repressive measures that he had promised to abolish: arbitrary mass arrests and denying political opponents the rights to assembly, protest and fair trial. Notably, the day after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize his government reportedly rounded up and imprisoned several dozen people who were demanding the right to hold a protest in the capital Addis Ababa. The rapprochement with Eritrea also quickly encountered obstacles. The rivalry between the TPLF and Eritrean President Afwerki in fact escalated, which exacerbated conflicts between groups in Ethiopia. The Eritrean government routinely closes the common border between the two countries, and the disputed territory — which was the flash point of the war in 1998 to 2000 — has not been demarcated. Most importantly, these conflicts led to immense human suffering, most notable of which was the displacement of around 1 million ethnic Gedeos, leaving Ethiopia with 2.9 million internally displaced people. Abiy’s reconciliatory tone and style of leadership were important and welcome pacifying additions into Ethiopian politics, given the great insecurity and toxic ethnic politics at the time. Had a leader with a belligerent, zero-sum approach to politics assumed power in 2018, the country would have probably descended into full-blown civil war. The unresolved conflicts, however, demonstrate the limitations of Abiy’s olive branch diplomacy. Ethiopians thus far remain bitterly divided on history and questions of nationhood. The country’s numerous ethno-nationalist groups continue to see Ethiopia as a union of nations and denounce most of its history as oppressive. There’s also a cost to the reliance on the charisma and agency of one individual leader. In Ethiopia’s case, Abiy’s government neglected the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) as an organization. The gap between the four parties that make up the front has increased under Abiy’s chairmanship. This is important, because each party controls its own regional state as well as militia. The inability of the ruling party to cooperate with each other is partly why the peace process with Eritrea remains incomplete, and why relations among Ethiopia’s regional states remain tense. While a focus on changing norms at a societal level may bear fruit in the long term, in the immediate future Ethiopia is unlikely to stabilize without its political elites reaching an agreement on how to manage the parliamentary elections in May 2020 and the planned restructuring of the EPRDF. The Nobel Peace Prize has had a unifying effect on the Ethiopian population and can provide Abiy Ahmed’s reform process with much-needed momentum. Don’t miss anything!

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — When Ethi­o­pia’s prime minister resigned in February after more than five years in office, there was little reason to think his successor would be an improvement. The East African country was under a state of emergency that followed a years-long crackdown on opposition political activity. Thousands of activists and dissident journalists had been detained, and hundreds had died in demonstrations crushed by government forces. Then came Abiy Ahmed, who at 42 is one of the youngest leaders on the continent. In his first month as Ethi­o­pia’s premier, he has ushered in an unlikely wave of hope and even optimism in this close U.S. ally that serves as something of a linchpin to the stability of East Africa. While ostensibly a democracy, Ethiopia is a highly centralized state with only the ruling party and its allies in Parliament. In recent years, however, unrest has grown, and on April 10, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the government to increase its respect for human rights and the rule of law. In a riveting speech at his April 2 inauguration, Abiy acknowledged some of Ethiopia’s enduring problems. He apologized for the deaths of protesters at demonstrations, welcomed differences of opinion and promised to heal the wounds between Ethiopia’s ethnic groups. The accession of Abiy, who hails from the Oromo community, brought a sharp drop in tension. Since he took office, Internet service has been restored to the countryside, charges against dozens of activists have been dropped, and he has embarked on meetings around the country, listening to grievances and promising reform, including term limits for his position. “As someone who grew up in Addis Ababa, one thing that is very foreign was seeing a prime minister come and organize town hall meetings and just sit down with people and discuss things,” said Zecharias Zelalem, a journalist and frequent commentator on Ethiopian affairs. “That has never happened, and it’s been going on for the past three weeks.” Activists, many of whom were released in the days following Abiy’s inauguration, pronounced themselves “cautiously optimistic” that, at long last, Ethiopia may be changing. “Our release means something. It is a signal for change, that he wants change,” said Eskinder Nega, a journalist who spent part of his youth in Washington, D.C, and had just spent six years in an Ethio­pian prison for his writings. He was released in February but detained again during the state of emergency a month later for meeting with friends — ironically in celebration of their release. Ten of his colleagues were also arrested. “But, ultimately, this is not what the nation wants,” Nega said. “The nation wants two things: the lifting of the state of emergency in the next 100 days and a call for an all-inclusive dialogue. This will set things right.” “Right” is not where Ethi­o­pia has been for the past three years, and its partners abroad have been worried. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Ethiopia to the stability of East Africa. It has the largest army in the region and the continent’s fastest-growing economy, and it is surrounded by disintegrating states such as Somalia and South Sudan. This regional rock of stability has looked shaky in recent years, with persistent anti-government protests by the country’s largest ethnic group, the Oromos, as well as unrest among the second-largest community, the Amharas. At the same time, clashes between Oromos and ethnic Somalis elsewhere in the country have left hundreds dead and displaced more than a million. All that has been compounded by the return of devastating droughts that have put millions in need of food aid. In the midst of the crisis, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned, and a state of emergency was declared as strikes erupted around the capital. As soon as he took office last month, Abiy started visiting the centers of dissatisfaction. He went to the Oromo town of Ambo and complimented the young men at the forefront of the demonstrations for protecting democracy. He visited the Somali region to discuss the ongoing clashes that have displaced so many, and he journeyed north to the Tigray region, seen by many government critics as unfairly dominating the military and economy, to put the population at ease about having an Oromo in charge of the government. He also met with opposition politicians and said that he welcomed their views and saw them as legitimate competition rather than as enemies of the state. In a speech before 20,000 people in Addis Ababa on April 15, he acknowledged that the bureaucracy and justice system have not been serving the people and promised reforms, including in the security services. “We will work closely to make the security and intelligence institutions free from political partiality,” he told the crowd. “They would [have to] act in accordance with the law and be accountable to the law upon transgressing the law.” In contrast to his predecessor, Abiy has strong popular support, which could give him leverage against elements of the establishment that might oppose changes. A reorganization of the security services, which critics maintain are dominated by the Tigrayans — who formed the backbone of the military after they overthrew the communist regime in 1991 — has yet to take place, however. They were left untouched in a recent cabinet reshuffle. The international reaction to Abiy’s first few weeks has been remarkably positive. A statement from the U.S. Embassy struck a note of hope as the State Department announced its 2017 human rights report, which describes the occurrence in Ethiopia of conditions such as “arbitrary deprivation of life, disappearances, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention by security forces.” “2018 has seen positive steps as well, including the release of thousands of prisoners. We are also encouraged by strong and clear statements by Prime Minister Abiy regarding the need for reforms,” the statement said. Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, who has clashed in the past with the government, was invited back to the country and allowed to visit areas and talk with people he had previously been prevented from seeing. “I was impressed by his commitment to openness and impressed by his apology for the irrevocable damage suffered by so many people during the repression of the recent protests,” Hussein told students at Addis Ababa University on April 25, referring to the new prime minister. In fact, some are saying Abiy may have saved the country — not to mention the reputation of the ruling party. In an editorial last year, the English language weekly Addis Standard issued a stark warning about the future of Ethiopia, saying that government infighting, ethnic tensions and popular anger had pushed the country toward collapse. Editor Tsedale Lemma, who now lives in Germany, said the peaceful transition of power to Abiy may have halted that slide. “They recognized that unless they do something, they were going down, and we came that close,” she said, lauding the outreach to the opposition and the release of prisoners. “What they are doing has given breathing space.” Like the recently released detainees, she said she was cautiously optimistic but worried that not enough new faces have come into the government with the cabinet reshuffle. She noted also that the security forces remain untouched and that the state of emergency remains in place. “It was a good beginning,” she said, “but . . . he could have done more.” paul.schemm@washpost.com	814	"[{""start"": 536, ""end"": 735, ""text"": ""n his first month as Ethi­o­pia’s premier, he has ushered in an unlikely wave of hope and even optimism in this close U.S. ally that serves as something of a linchpin to the stability of East Africa"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1168, ""end"": 1327, ""text"": ""He apologized for the deaths of protesters at demonstrations, welcomed differences of opinion and promised to heal the wounds between Ethiopia’s ethnic groups."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1328, ""end"": 1689, ""text"": ""The accession of Abiy, who hails from the Oromo community, brought a sharp drop in tension.

. A peace accord brokered in Algiers in 2000 left the fate of Badme and other regions to an international arbitration council, which, using colonial-era documents, decided in favor of Eritrea in 2002. Ethiopia refused to heed the decision, and the two countries have remained at war since, supporting rival rebel groups and occasionally shelling each other, killing hundreds. While Ethi­o­pia has become one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, Eritrea has remained largely closed to the outside world, with some of the world’s harshest restrictions on freedom of the press. The country also remains on a war footing, with indefinite universal conscription for the military, prompting many thousands to flee the country. Peace with Ethi­o­pia would remove much of the justification for this war footing, said Plaut, and that would probably encourage change in Isaias’s regime, which has ruled the country since independence. “If it is successful, there will no longer be any reason to have 100,000s of Eritreans trapped in indefinite military service and postponing having democratic elections,” he said. “And that will make the situation much harder for President Isaias in the long run.” The first inkling of change came June 5, when Abiy, who took office in April, broke with decades of policy and said he would recognize the 2000 deal, as part of radical domestic overhauls. There have been protests in Badme, with people insisting they would refuse to leave and the decision made a mockery of the thousands who’d died in the fighting. The dominant political party in that region, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, which is part of the governing coalition, also expressed opposition to the decision — a rare split for Ethi­o­pia, where the politics has long had an authoritarian cast. In a question-and-answer session in parliament on Monday, Abiy came under criticism for the move. He reminded lawmakers he himself was part of the army that drove the Eritreans out of Badme. “I was standing in that village when we put up flag, and I cried. Many of my friends who fought in that war, we had to bury,” said Abiy, a former lieutenant colonel in the army. “I paid the price.” While acknowledging the massive losses in the war, he said it was time to end it and bring jobs and prosperity to the people living along that border. There has been no sign of a withdrawal yet of Ethio­pian forces from Badme. Abiy was voted in by the ruling party as prime minister in March after years of unrest by the country’s main ethnic groups and has since embarked on reforms in an effort to open up the politics in the country. In his speech, Eritrea’s Isaias acknowledged the changes in Ethi­o­pia and deemed them an opportunity for peace. “It spurred the wrath and a rebellion in the people who said ‘enough is enough,’ ” he said “Ethiopia is now at a turning point or transition.” paul.schemm@washpost.com	813	"[{""start"": 728, ""end"": 931, ""text"": ""Peace with Ethi­o­pia would remove much of the justification for this war footing, said Plaut, and that would probably encourage change in Isaias’s regime, which has ruled the country since independence."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1197, ""end"": 1384, ""text"": ""The first inkling of change came June 5, when Abiy, who took office in April, broke with decades of policy and said he would recognize the 2000 deal, as part of radical domestic overhauls"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2643, ""end"": 2739, ""text"": ""Eritrea’s Isaias acknowledged the changes in Ethi­o­pia and deemed them an opportunity for peace"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1308, ""end"": 1384, ""text"": ""said he would recognize the 2000 deal, as part of radical domestic overhauls"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	791	2023-04-28T10:40:05.899558Z	2023-04-28T10:40:05.899656Z	345.871
ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — Two weeks after the Ethiopian government made the surprise announcement that it was ready to accept a nearly 20-year-old peace deal with Eritrea, the reclusive leader of the country said Wednesday it would send a delegation to Addis Ababa to discuss the matter. The move brings a glimmer of hope that one of the bloodiest and most intractable conflicts in the Horn of Africa — between two countries closely bound by language, religion and ethnicity — will be resolved soon. In a nationally televised speech marking Eritrean Martyrs’ Day, President Isaias Afwerki said both peoples yearned for peace and recent changes in Ethi­o­pia made that more possible. “We will send a delegation to Addis Ababa to gauge current developments directly and in depth as well as to chart out a plan for continuous future action,” he said, according to an official translation of the speech. “The Eritrean people, but also the Ethiopian people, have lost an opportunity of two generations for over half a century,” Afwerki added. According to his chief of staff, Ethio­pian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has responded by expressing “readiness to welcome warmly and with considerable goodwill the Eritrean delegation.” Although a great deal of complex discussion and negotiation must still take place, it is the first break in the wall of hostility between the countries in two decades and could bring change to Eritrea’s closed-off regime. “It is a huge development,” said Martin Plaut, author of “Understanding Eritrea” and a senior research fellow at the University of London. “It’s the most significant development since the end of the war in 2000 and the rejection of the boundary agreement which was meant to settle where the border lay between the two countries.” Eritrea, a mountainous coastal country of just 5 million, was once a province of Ethi­o­pia. However, after it helped Ethiopian rebels in 1991 overthrow the communist-led government, it voted for independence in 1993. Tensions flared with its former Ethiopian allies over the border demarcation, turning into a full-scale war in 1998 over the remote town of Badme.

Fresh off a successful U.S. tour and a string of daring political reforms at home, Ethiopia’s youthful new prime minister is riding a wave of popularity in this strategic East African nation, the continent’s second-largest. At the same time, however, the country has been racked by new outbreaks of ethnic unrest, with aid agencies reporting more than a million people driven from their homes just this year, mostly by violent conflict. Seeking to safeguard his efforts to transform the once-authoritarian nation, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, 42, has departed from his usual rhetoric of love and reconciliation to insist that security is a top priority. “There are groups that are working in unison to cause chaos in different parts of the country,” Abiy told reporters Saturday. “They are triggering peoples’ emotions to this end.” Last week, days after Abiy spoke of the rule of law as “the glue and foundation” of social harmony, 300 people were arrested in Ethiopia’s Southern regional state for taking part in violence and 500 more in the Oromia region. It was three years of anti-government protests spearheaded by the Oromo people, Ethiopia’s biggest ethnic group, that helped bring Abiy, an Oromo, to power in April after his predecessor resigned. The protests stopped, but they have been replaced this summer by clashes between groups looking to settle age-old disputes about land. The most serious took place in the south between the Gedeo people and the Guji Oromo, precipitating massive displacement. July also saw clashes between Muslims and Christians in the Bale area of Oromia and mob attacks on ethnic minorities including Tigrayans and Somalis. This month, a man was lynched in the Oromo town of Shashemene by a mob convinced he was carrying a bomb. Then there was the grenade tossed at Abiy during a June 23 rally and the possible assassination July 26 of the project manager of the landmark dam Ethi­o­pia is building on the Nile River. Visiting Republican Rep. Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey, who has been critical of Ethiopia’s rights record, said the United States must support the country during this period. “It’s breathtaking what’s happening here. It’s got to be sustained,” he said Thursday in Addis Ababa. “We have to make sure a flare-up, even a serious one with large loss of life, doesn’t become an undoing of a trajectory that I think will lead to peace and reconciliation.” Ethiopia is a patchwork of more than 80 ethnic groups whose differences were often smothered by the heavy hand of the state, which since 1991 has been a coalition of parties from the four main ethnic groups: the Oromo, the Amhara, the Tigrayans and the southern tribes. The new government’s moves to expand political freedom and curtail the security services have allowed many of the groups’ old grievances to erupt again, said E.J. Hogendoorn, deputy Africa director for the International Crisis Group. “This is a very familiar phenomenon when it comes to the democratization process from hitherto relatively autocratic regimes,” he said. “There are a lot of pent-up frustrations with how the country has been managed, particularly with land.” Compounding the problem, Ethiopia’s economy is in a perilous state. There is heavy foreign debt, and a shortage of international currency is hampering the government’s ambitious infrastructure projects, although Abiy announced Saturday that the World Bank has agreed to provide $1 billion in budget support in coming months, the Reuters news service reported. Abiy spent much of his U.S. trip appealing to hundreds of thousands of expatriate Ethiopians to invest in their native country and come visit, with hotels and travel firms encouraged to offer special deals for the Ethiopian New Year on Sept. 11. Even as Abiy’s reforms pile up, including the release of thousands of prisoners, the dismissal of hard-line military and intelligence heads, opposition figures allowed home and a promise to revise the country’s notorious anti-terrorism law, fears are growing that dissatisfaction with the economy could ultimately derail everything. While there are plans to encourage more foreign investment and liberalize what has long been a state-dominated economy, it will take time to create the jobs being demanded by many of the angry youths. Mohammed Ademo, an analyst of Ethio­pian affairs who founded the Opride news site while living abroad for 16 years, returned to Ethiopia this summer and traveled through the Oromo region. He found frustration rising in the countryside, especially among the “Qeerroo,” the young men at the forefront of the protests that helped bring Abiy to power. He also noted that despite the dramatic changes at the top level of government, the local officials who were at the center of the protesters’ grievances are still in place. “The Qeerroo feel that the local administration remains corrupt and unresponsive and that the central government is not addressing their economic demands,” he said. In many places, groups of youths are acting as self-appointed police, creating the specter of parallel systems of government and threatening the country’s integrity, said Awol Allo, an expert on Ethiopia and a lecturer in law at Britain’s Keele University. Allo said the government must step up to deal with the new violence, but he acknowledged that authorities are hamstrung because of the security forces’ past reputation for killing protesters. “If they pass an order for security forces to take measures, and they use disproportionate force against people, that would have consequences affecting the legitimacy and support they are enjoying right now,” he said. Amid these problems, Abiy’s opponents in the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the party hailing from the north that once dominated the government, have become more vocal. This month, the president of Tigray state warned that if the central government continues on this track, it risks destroying the federal system in place for a quarter-century. “The country is falling apart, and you cannot keep Ethiopia [together] by patching little holes,” Debretsion Gebremichael said at a news conference. The TPLF’s criticisms strike many as presumptuous, given its role in creating the current conditions. Jawar Mohammed, an influential Oromo activist and a fierce regime critic before Abiy came to power, attributes some of the unrest to those seeking to sabotage the reforms. “This is like the power struggles in Addis Ababa manifesting itself in the street,” he told The Washington Post. Even former prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, whose resignation helped clear the way for Abiy’s rise, has publicly said that the TPLF was overbearing and blocked reforms during his tenure as premier and head of the ruling EPRDF party coalition. But Hailemariam’s deputy, Demeke Mekonnen, whose support for Abiy helped ensure his election and who retained his post under Abiy, said in an interview that reform had always been the party’s plan — it was just a question of speed. “Previously it was a very, very gradual, incremental process,” he said. “Now it is a very progressive and dramatic approach.” Demeke acknowledged the new government’s challenges, including replacing the officials unable to manage the conflicts in the countryside, boosting the country’s earning capacity and meeting the sky-high expectations of the people. Still, he said, there was no question of slowing the pace of change. “Keeping this momentum and inclusive approach; deepening democracy; improving governance, the services; changing the bureaucracy, the attitudes and response — that is the serious agenda for the upcoming time,” he said. paul.schemm@washpost.com	809	"[{""start"": 3515, ""end"": 3760, ""text"": ""Abiy spent much of his U.S. trip appealing to hundreds of thousands of expatriate Ethiopians to invest in their native country and come visit, with hotels and travel firms encouraged to offer special deals for the Ethiopian New Year on Sept. 11."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3515, ""end"": 3760, ""text"": ""Abiy spent much of his U.S. trip appealing to hundreds of thousands of expatriate Ethiopians to invest in their native country and come visit, with hotels and travel firms encouraged to offer special deals for the Ethiopian New Year on Sept. 11."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	787	2023-04-27T22:04:51.574506Z	2023-04-27T22:04:51.574613Z	714.194
"WASHINGTON — The last time Neamin Zeleke saw home was in 1986. He was 16, dressed in his only suit, waiting for a plane in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that would take him to the United States for high school. With a repressive communist regime running his country, he never returned. Instead, he settled in the Washington suburbs and remained there as the decades passed and the old dictatorship was replaced by a new one. He raised a family in Virginia and lost contact with relatives at home. Then in February, after three years of mounting unrest, Ethiopia’s prime minister resigned. Abiy Ahmed, an outspoken 42-year-old reformer, took office. Since then, there has been a wave of stunning change. Abiy has lifted a long-standing state of emergency, ended a decades-old conflict with neighboring Eritrea and called for Ethiopia to transition into a multiparty democracy. For the many Ethiopians who fled the country during the long years of autocracy, the reforms have revived a dream they once thought impossible: going home. It was particularly unlikely for people like Zeleke, a leader in a resistance movement who agitated for change from abroad. In 2013, he was branded a terrorist by Ethiopia's ruling party and sentenced in absentia to 18 years in prison. He decided that even calling his mother was too dangerous for her; they haven’t spoken in six years. But now Zeleke is dreaming. In August, he bought a plane ticket to Ethiopia, planning to surprise his mother, celebrate the Ethiopian New Year on Sept. 11 and visit relatives he hasn't seen since he was a child. But after years as an activist, he is also clear-eyed about the challenges that lie ahead. Moves meant to expand political freedoms have also allowed old ethnic grievances to flare up, leading to a new spate of violence. The institutions that propped up the previous administration have been working to undermine Abiy's reforms. ""Even though they have lost power, we know they have money and guns,” Zeleke said. But Zeleke is still eager to go back. ""There’s much to be done,"" he said. ""We have a new nation to build.” That eagerness is common in the area around Washington, which is home to the largest Ethiopian community in the world outside Africa — and some of the fiercest critics of Ethiopia's rulers. Whenever news of a brutal government crackdown emerged, groups of Ethiopians staged protests outside the State Department or the Ethiopian Embassy. In recent years, Washington-area Ethiopians led a growing movement to provide accurate information about what was going on in the country, launching blogs and online television stations. “We were so mad for so long,” said Kenfe Bellay, a 61-year-old who lives in Silver Spring, Md., Bellay fled Ethiopia in 1976 after the communist regime confiscated his father’s farm and family home. He eventually settled in the United States and has regularly attended protests and candlelight vigils in Washington, hoping to raise awareness of human rights violations in Ethiopia. On a humid evening in July, Bellay shuddered as he recalled the stories he had heard over the years — dissidents jailed by the regime, opponents tortured and unarmed protesters massacred. “It hurts, of course,” he said. “It hurts no matter where you are.” Zeleke, as a member of a resistance group called Patriotic Ginbot 7, traveled throughout the United States and Europe to meet exiled political leaders and lobby international organizations to exert pressure on the Ethiopian government. He spoke regularly to PG7 members operating clandestinely in Ethiopia. When the group's secretary general, Andargachew Tsege, was abducted in Yemen in 2014, Zeleke flew to Eritrea for weeks and months at a time to mobilize armed resistance units. Andargachew is now a free man — he and hundreds of other political prisoners were released by Abiy in May. Zeleke watched on television as his old friend was welcomed by rapturous crowds in the streets of Addis Ababa. “I’ve invested so much time, energy and money on this,"" he said. ""Now I feel, finally, I feel that part of what I’ve struggled and sacrificed for is in the process of materializing.” The optimism is deeply tied to the figure of Abiy, whose charisma and reforms have captivated many Ethiopians abroad. ""You know, I used to watch movies after work. Now I just watch YouTube videos of Dr. Abiy,” said Tibebu Hailemariam, 50, the vice president of the Ethiopian Community Center of Maryland. Bellay admitted that he is also prone to flipping through news items about Abiy while he mans the counter at Sidamo Coffee &amp; Tea, the coffee shop he owns in Northeast Washington. Everyone he knows, he said, has been talking about the new prime minister for months. So when Abiy announced in July that he would tour the United States, his visit quickly dominated the attention of the community here. Ethiopians from as far away as Florida and Colorado booked tickets to Washington, where Abiy was scheduled to speak at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on July 28. Hailemariam visited the embassy multiple times in the hope of finding a way to participate. The excitement swelled during the week of Abiy’s “grand rally.” Groups crowded into the lobby of the Watergate Hotel, where Abiy was staying, hoping to get an early glimpse of the new prime minister. Dozens of Ethiopian restaurants in the region prepared their kitchens to host parties scheduled for Saturday night, while those at home pored over road maps to determine the best routes into the city. When the morning of July 28 finally arrived, the line to see Abiy wrapped several times around the block. Families driving in from North Carolina and New Jersey honked their car horns and rolled down windows to high-five performers swaying their hips along Mount Vernon Place; those waiting in line cracked open plastic containers of curries and injera bread to share with neighbors. “It’s just like back home,” said Fekadu Amanu, 46, who was standing near the front of the line with his three young children. Abiy's speech, delivered that afternoon in a packed and raucous hall, called for unity and the support of the diaspora in rebuilding Ethiopia. But the words were seemingly less important than his presence and what it signified. Bellay, stuck behind the counter at his shop, was not part of the jubilant crowd at the rally. But even at work, he said, the atmosphere felt different. Ethiopians streamed into the shop all afternoon to share stories of the speech and sip coffee; when Bellay traveled home to Silver Spring — the Washington area's ""Little Ethiopia"" — there were large groups of people celebrating in the streets. “It was really exciting,"" Hailemariam said. ""I’m 50 years old, and I’ve never seen people like this. It’s pure love."" Even Zeleke's remaining doubts were erased after a two-hour meeting between Abiy and PG7 leaders in the evening following the rally. “The candor, the openness with which he shared details about the transition was astounding,"" Zeleke said. ""We’re very happy with what they’ve managed to do in this 100 days. There’s much to be done, but the progress has been very impressive.” For Washington’s Ethiopian community, the rally weekend in July was an unbridled celebration. But in the days and weeks that have followed, many in the diaspora have been left wondering how they will fit into this new era of Ethiopian history. Even with Abiy’s open invitation, the path home is not straightforward. Zeleke hopes to return permanently someday. But with three school-age children who speak little Amharic, a visit of a few weeks is all he manage for now. Bellay, who has two daughters in college, is excited for his own trip back, but he believes there’s nothing left for him in Ethiopia. “I don’t have a home anymore. It was taken. I don’t have anywhere to go, and my family, we dispersed years ago,” he said. Hailemariam is more seriously considering the move back, but he also has worries. “Moving to Ethiopia is very exciting, but I have to find my place first,” he said. “I can’t go there and be a burden, so I need to see where can I contribute, what place and in what capacity.” As Ethiopians abroad plan their next steps, they will probably look to those who have already dared to leave the United States for good. One of them is 36-year-old Mohammed Ademo, who until recently was one of the most prominent government critics in the diaspora. After spending 16 years in exile, Ademo saw Abiy’s rise to power as an opportunity he couldn’t miss. In June, just three months after Abiy took office, the journalist relinquished his status as an asylum seeker in the United States and booked a one-way ticket to Addis Ababa, leaving his wife and their 2-year-old son in Washington. “The irony of it is I’ve been away from my immediate family for 16 years, and the only family I had in the U.S. was my wife and my son. Now I’m with my family, but my son and my wife are away,” Ademo said by telephone from Addis Ababa. “It’s hard, but this requires some level of sacrifice. If we want this country to change, we have to make these tough decisions.” There’s a lot of work that needs to be done, Ademo admitted. But at least for now, he’s taking a moment to relish being back. ""It feels finally like this is mine,” he said, the sounds of rain and conversation humming in the background. “I enjoyed living in the U.S. … but I never really felt quite at home. Now I feel liberated. I truly, truly feel at home."""	807	"[{""start"": 696, ""end"": 868, ""text"": ""Abiy has lifted a long-standing state of emergency, ended a decades-old conflict with neighboring Eritrea and called for Ethiopia to transition into a multiparty democracy."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6025, ""end"": 6167, ""text"": ""biy's speech, delivered that afternoon in a packed and raucous hall, called for unity and the support of the diaspora in rebuilding Ethiopia."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	785	2023-04-27T21:46:23.650601Z	2023-04-27T21:46:23.650688Z	505.45
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed picked up his Nobel Peace Prize in Stockholm earlier this month, then returned home to Ethiopia to face challenges beyond sustaining peace with Eritrea. In November, Abiy proposed merging the four-party Ethiopian People’s Revolution Democratic Front (EPRDF) into one party, bringing an end to the ruling group in Ethiopia since the communist junta was overthrown in 1991. The EPRDF came to power as the Cold War ended. Instead of abandoning their Marxist-Leninist roots, the group’s leaders tried to fuse revolutionary principles and class politics with capitalism and liberal democracy. The EPRDF’s successor party — the Prosperity Party — is a radical departure from the past, in terms of ideology and membership base. Here’s what you need to know. Ethiopia’s party coalition was stabilizing, until it wasn’t The four parties that made up the EPRDF were the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, the Amhara Democratic Party, the Oromo Democratic Party and the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement. The first three parties, respectively, represented the Tigray, Amhara and Oromo nations, which together are more than 70 percent of Ethiopia’s population. The Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement represented a regional state composed of numerous smaller national communities. But EPRDF founders — leaders from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front — and other ethno-nationalist politicians strongly oppose the new PP. These dissenters want to maintain the old party structure and ideology and are unlikely to join the new Prosperity Party. Parties that had never been allowed to join the EPRDF — the ruling parties in the Afar, Benishangul-Gumuz, Harari, Somalia and Gambella regions — have decided to dissolve and merge with the Prosperity Party. The EPRDF leadership previously argued that these largely pastoral regions lacked the agrarian class structure that revolutionary democracy presupposed. For almost three decades these groups were relegated to the status of partner parties; they were part of the federal government but couldn’t vote in EPRDF committees, where the group reached all of Ethiopia’s major political decisions. The EPRDF’s role has come to an end The separation — if it takes place peacefully and legitimately — could prove a source of stability in Ethiopia. The ideological ambiguity of the EPRDF has been a destabilizing factor and breaking it up may pave the way for establishing internally coherent parties and coalitions, which could mean greater stability in Ethiopia more generally. EPRDF’s fragmentation began when its strongman, Meles Zenawi, passed away in 2012. Since then the four parties that make up EPRDF haven’t been able to agree how to share power. The power struggle enabled protests to escalate in 2016 and culminated in Abiy Ahmed becoming prime minister in 2018. The fragmentation of the EPRDF was exacerbated under Abiy Ahmed’s leadership, leading to, among other things, the political assassination of Ethiopia’s military chief and the president of the Amhara Regional State on June 22. The power struggle also crystallized irreconcilable ideological positions within the leadership. Abiy’s reforms break from EPRDF’s foundations Abiy Ahmed came to power with a vision to transform the EPRDF as well as Ethiopia at large. His first target was the developmental state economic model, which had guided policy in Ethiopia since 2000. Under this model, the government plays an active role in the economy and invests in infrastructure, human capital and energy to fast-track a structural transformation of the economy from largely agrarian to increasingly industrial. Abiy undermined this development model by drawing attention to financial mismanagement in Ethiopia’s state-owned enterprises, notably the military industrial complex METEC. He then declared that Ethiopia’s model for development would be “capitalism.” The most controversial reform, however, was Abiy’s move away from the EPRDF’s nationalist narrative. The EPRDF had long depicted Ethiopia’s ethnic groups as victims of forced assimilationist policy — under a nation-building project that began in the 19th century and ended in 1995 with the introduction of the Ethiopia’s federal constitution, which granted the “nations, nationalities and peoples” the right to self-determination. Abiy formulated an alternative history that de-emphasized ethnic oppression and instead focused on ethnic harmony and national unity. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front leads the resistance against Abiy’s revolution The Tigray People’s Liberation Front wants to continue the centrally directed economic model and has made saving the federal constitutional arrangement its main rallying point. In August, it convened a conference for pro-federalism forces that resembled a first step toward making a “federalist coalition” as an alternative to Abiy’s new Prosperity Party. A peaceful divorce of EPRDF member parties could be derailed by the internal fragmentation with the factions. The leadership in Abiy’s own Oromo Democratic Party, for example, is split between those that embrace Abiy’s nationalist narrative and those that want to stick to the old ethno-nationalist discourse. Abiy’s critics claim that the dismantling of the EPRDF and establishment of the Prosperity Party did not follow appropriate party procedures, saying that one individual imposed this change. Notably, the leader of the political process that brought Abiy Ahmed to power in 2018, former president of the Oromia Regional State Lemma Megersa, has made public his opposition to the Prosperity Party. What does this mean for Ethiopia going forward? If Ethiopians feel that their leaders are imposing this merger, the Prosperity Party’s coherence probably rests on shaky ground. This could make it difficult for Abiy and his new party to uphold law and order and navigate through the political reform process. Efforts to turn the restructuring process into an opportunity to score tactical victories against various groups raises risks for instability as well. The different EPRDF factions want others to come out of the party transformation as bruised as possible. Over the past weeks, these groups have been exchanging provocative accusations. Events throughout 2019, including the June 22 killings and the conflict between Abiy Ahmed and Jawar Mohamed’s supporters, illustrate how tit-for-tat dynamics can escalate into violence. The fate of the May 2020 parliamentary elections and general stability in Ethiopia will depend on how this process unfolds over the next few months. Don’t miss anything!

Ethio­pian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s Nobel Peace Prize win on Friday honored a unique peacemaking effort, but it also fit a global pattern. Others were believed to have chances — including Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg — but the Nobel Committee affirmed the prize’s commitment to global diversity. It wasn’t always that way. Until the 1970s, the vast majority of laureates had European or North American origins. Promoters of peace from developing countries were largely ignored. But in the following decades, the prize became much more international — and now it includes many laureates from other parts of the world, particularly Africa, Asia and the former Soviet Union. More of the recipients have also been women. “The impact of the decolonization of Africa, the Vietnam War and the fear of an atomic war made the Nobel Committee more focused on conflicts outside Europe,” said Oivind Stenersen, who co-authored a book about the Nobel Peace Prize, in an interview in 2015. While Ethiopia’s Abiy is expanding the laureates’ geographical diversity, he still fits at least two pre-1970s characteristics: He is a political leader, rather than an underdog, and he is a man. Until the 1970s, the Norway-based peace prize committee had focused on political leaders, but it began including more dissidents and lesser-known figures in the second half of the 20th century. For instance, no Russian won the Nobel Peace Prize between 1901 and 1974. But in 1975, the prize was awarded to Soviet nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov. Sakharov, the mastermind behind Soviet thermonuclear weapons, received the honor “for his opposition to the abuse of power and his work for human rights,” according to the committee’s official website. Soviet leaders viewed the committee’s choice as offensive and prohibited Sakharov from traveling to Norway to accept his award. But the decision reflected the growing shift within the Norway-based committee that continued in the following decades. The dogged defense of democracy and liberties by activists and opposition politicians took a more prominent role in the following decades, for instance with the 2003 decision to award the prize to Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi. Three influential women from Africa and the Middle East received the 2011 award: Liberia’s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first elected female president in post-colonial Africa; peace activist Leymah Gbowee, also from Liberia; and Tawakkol Karman, a leading Yemeni activist. Malala Yousafzai, who has advocated for girls’ right to an education in Pakistan and beyond, became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2014, when she was 17. Despite expanded diversity, not all of the committee’s choices have been uncontroversial. In fact, the prize has long been among the world’s most politically polarizing honors. When President Barack Obama received the prize for his efforts “to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” in 2009, his critics and even some supporters thought the honor was premature. The selection of Abiy as the 2019 laureate may be met with some skepticism, too. His supporters have credited him for ushering in an era of hope for greater freedoms in Ethiopia after years of authoritarian rule. Thousands of political prisoners have been released, and the first free elections have been promised for 2020. Abiy has also been applauded for his conciliatory moves toward Eritrea and for ending a 20-year long military dispute with that country. But some of Abiy’s reforms have also triggered fears of future tensions. He has yet to implement other promised reforms and is only in the early stages of his term — a situation reminiscent of Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize win in 2009.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — From the grand palace he had constructed on a hill overlooking this city 130 years ago, Emperor Menelik II plotted the brutal campaigns that would consolidate all of what is now Ethiopia under his rule. Five successive governments — two more emperors and a communist regime included — would rule from the same palace, orchestrating much of this country’s tragic history from within its walls. Its war rooms were where massacres, purges and mass incarcerations were ordered. Menelik’s basement refrigerator rooms were turned into torture dungeons. This week, the latest man to lead Ethiopia from this secretive compound opened most of its grounds to the public. The privately funded, $170 million renovation includes a park, a zoo and a museum of the country’s history, with exhibits adorning walls once stained with the blood of prisoners. The project is emblematic of the leadership of Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s 43-year-old reformist prime minister who on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in ending the violent standoff with neighboring Eritrea. In office less than two years, he has given people here hope that what was once secret will now be public and what was once authoritarian will become democratic. Abiy is promising nothing less than a renaissance in Ethi­o­pia. He has scheduled its first free, multiparty elections for next year, released thousands of political prisoners, lifted a ban on opposition parties and pushed for the prosecution of former officials accused of torture. His success in transforming Ethi­o­pia depends on unifying this incredibly diverse country despite persistent ethnic tensions that displaced millions and killed more than a thousand during his first year in office. “Abiy is trying to create unity, and maybe that can only happen by ignoring certain parts of our history,” said Seyoum Teshome, a writer and political analyst. “But you must magnify the positive things — the common history and common future. If we don’t do that, we will return to the brink of collapse.” The palace’s new museum, for instance, gives no indication that Menelik II, who is regarded by many as the nation’s founding father, waged what some historians classify as genocides as he conquered the lands he eventually called Abyssinia, which became modern Ethiopia. Instead, a wax figure of the emperor sits on his original wood-carved throne, looking out across the banquet hall where he once hosted feasts, with platters and goblets from the time preserved in cases along the wall. The lionizing of Menelik has angered some Ethiopians, as have other moves by Abiy as he has tried to move toward democratic elections. Ethi­o­pia is divided politically into nine  semiautonomous ethno-linguistic regions, which compete for power at the center. The palace grounds have been renamed Unity Park and feature an impressionist sculpture garden highlighting traditions from each region. “For decades, this place was been nothing more than a shabby military camp with various offices,” said Tamirat Haile, an Abiy aide who was in charge of the palace renovation. “It was never an inclusive place. Now we have exhibits dedicated to all our different ethnic groups. We are renewing the palace in the name of unity.” While Abiy has been hailed on the international stage for his apparent dedication to democratic reform, violent clashes in Ethiopia’s countryside have cast doubt on the likelihood — and prudence — of holding elections next year. Around 3 million people were forced from their homes in 2018, the most in any country in the world. And Ethiopia’s economy remains dangerously weak, which has prompted tens of thousands to attempt perilous sea crossings toward Saudi Arabia and Europe in search of better lives. Although the palace was funded through private donations, some critics have questioned whether it is the best use of money in a country where the average person earns less than $2,000 a year and infrastructure is rudimentary in many places. “Addis Ababa is a city that has constant electricity and water problems, that doesn’t have efficient public transportation,” said Biruk Terrefe, a PhD student studying the politics of Ethiopia’s infrastructure. “It is growing faster than Beijing or Jakarta. There are a lot of other things this city needs.” From the palace grounds, visitors can see Addis Ababa’s skyline, cluttered with the gray skeletons of skyscrapers under construction. Among the urban amenities that Addis Ababa lacks are parks, said Maheder Gebremedhin, an architect who hosts a radio show in the city. “This was a place that no one could go to, and now it will not only be open, it will be a park. It suggests that transparency is the intention of the government,” he said. “There is a certain euphoria about this.” max.bearak@washpost.com	801	"[{""start"": 864, ""end"": 1083, ""text"": ""The project is emblematic of the leadership of Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s 43-year-old reformist prime minister who on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in ending the violent standoff with neighboring Eritrea."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1084, ""end"": 1245, ""text"": ""n office less than two years, he has given people here hope that what was once secret will now be public and what was once authoritarian will become democratic."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1246, ""end"": 1527, ""text"": ""Abiy is promising nothing less than a renaissance in Ethi­o­pia. He has scheduled its first free, multiparty elections for next year, released thousands of political prisoners, lifted a ban on opposition parties and pushed for the prosecution of former officials accused of torture"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1744, ""end"": 1902, ""text"": ""“Abiy is trying to create unity, and maybe that can only happen by ignoring certain parts of our history,” said Seyoum Teshome, a writer and political analys"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2614, ""end"": 2671, ""text"": ""Abiy as he has tried to move toward democratic elections."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2614, ""end"": 2670, ""text"": ""Abiy as he has tried to move toward democratic elections"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	781	2023-04-27T16:05:40.080667Z	2023-04-27T16:05:40.080776Z	236.871
In Ethiopia, a wave of assassinations has renewed fears of political turmoil. On June 22, gunmen burst into a meeting, killing the president of the Amhara region, Ambachew Mekonnen and two aides. Shortly thereafter, a bodyguard killed the army chief of staff, Gen. Seare Mekonnen, along with retired Gen. Gezai Abera. Two days later, Ethiopian special forces killed Gen. Asaminew Tsige on the outskirts of Bahir Dar. The government alleges that Asaminew was the ringleader of this violent conspiracy and released a tape recording of Asaminew saying, “we have taken measures . . . because the regional ruling party leaders have sabotaged the people’s demands.” The political reforms Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed initiated in 2018 created an opening for liberalization but also provided opportunities for divisive ethnic politics. The “mini-coup” attempt in June raised questions about these reforms — particularly the elections scheduled for May 2020 — and how newly reestablished institutions will manage escalating political volatility. What guides Ethiopian politics? The Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been in power since 1991, winning 100 percent of the seats in the 2015 election. As Terrence Lyons argues in his recent book, Ethiopian politics over the past 28 years have been shaped by the centralizing logic of a strong authoritarian party that grew out of the victorious rebel movement, on the one hand, and a constitutional system that emphasized ethnically defined regional states and political parties, on the other. Ethiopia’s ethno-federalist system has contributed to tensions within and among the country’s regions. Though Asaminew held a high position in the EPRDF-controlled regional state, in recent weeks he had been echoing a surge in hard-line Amhara nationalism — including calls for Amharas to arm themselves. Other regions also mobilized along ethno-nationalist lines In Oromiya, the armed wing of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), an insurgent group seeking “self-determination” for the Oromo people since the 1970s, broke with the organization’s political wing. That makes it more difficult for the Ethiopian government to demobilize OLF combatants — and for the OLF’s political wing to negotiate credibly on political matters. In the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR), ethnic sentiment has driven the Sidama zone’s bid to become a separate regional state. Officials in the Sidama zone are threatening to unilaterally declare statehood on July 18 — the constitutionally mandated one-year deadline for the federal government to organize a referendum on self-determination after a petition for statehood is submitted. Analysts at the International Crisis Group caution that the Sidama bid for statehood may “catalyze a violent unraveling of the Southern Nations.” Other groups, including Wolayta, Hadiya and Gurage, have also started to advocate for statehood. When Abiy came to power in 2018, he advanced a number of political reforms. Ethiopia normalized relations with Eritrea, released political prisoners and allowed opposition leaders to return from exile. However, the next stages of reform — institutional changes that embrace a more liberal order — are slower and harder to implement. The government has taken a number of steps in this direction. For example, Abiy has reached out to civil society in making appointments to the Federal Supreme Court, the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia and the Human Rights Commission. But reconstructing the security and intelligence services has proved more difficult. As a result, significant insecurity has escalated in many parts of the country, leaving nearly 3 million internally displaced people. The government faces the challenge of anticipating and mitigating ethno-nationalist violence, particularly as the country prepares for elections next year. Will Ethiopia be ready for elections in 2020? Prime Minister Abiy’s reputation as a reformer will face a serious test in getting the country ready in time for the 2020 elections. The appointment of Birtukan Mideksa, a former opposition party leader, to head the country’s election board demonstrates Abiy’s recognition of the symbolic and political importance of the 2020 polls. The government has also appointed a new, professional electoral board, after consultations with opposition parties. Abiy and opposition officials insist that elections will take place on time — though many analysts and Ethiopians expect some delay. The problem is that postponing beyond 2020 would run afoul of the constitution. And an election delay would risk inflaming tensions, and result in ethnic and political violence. Though many observers anticipate that the 2020 polls will be the most competitive in years, the EPRDF is likely to retain its parliamentary majority. The ruling party, with some 7 million members, remains the dominant institution across the diverse states. The EPRDF controls the distribution of central resources, the endowment funds that own a significant portion of the economy and the distribution of key agricultural inputs such as fertilizer. Its power may have diminished since the 2015-2018 mass protests, but the EPRDF retains an integrated network of cadres across Ethiopia. The opposition parties remain at odds with each other on specific issues, making a broad counter-alliance to compete with the EPRDF unlikely. Many Ethiopians both within the EPRDF and the opposition recognize the need for a national discussion on issues relating to the constitution — and in particular the nature of its federalism. Similarly, the EPRDF is considering changes to the party and has floated the idea that it may transform itself from a coalition into a party that individuals join directly rather than through membership in regional party affiliates. These questions, however, are fraught with controversy, and open debate is unlikely before the next round of elections. Heading into 2020, the EPRDF remains the dominant party in Ethiopia. The process of liberalization has provided the space for other political groups to mobilize around polarizing narratives and divisive attacks, however. While the June 22 violence indicates the fragility of the reform process, slowing these reforms or pushing back the 2020 elections could risk increasing violence and instability. Don’t miss anything!

After a year of political upheaval and mass protests, Ethiopia’s autocratic government has been suggesting that it might be willing to transform its elections-for-show into elections that are genuinely free and fair. Within the past year, the government has freed its political prisoners. Its prime minister resigned. The ruling coalition held its first-ever contested elections to replace him — and selected the protesters’ choice of Abiy Ahmed, the first time that a prime minister had come from the Oromo ethnic group. In July, while visiting Washington, Abiy told a group of thousands of expatriate Ethiopian dissidents that his “ultimate goal is to ensure that a democratic election takes place in Ethiopia.” But many obstacles block that path. Here’s what has to happen before Ethiopia can hold a truly democratic election. The Ethiopian government has been working against free and fair elections for a long time In the early 1990s, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) overthrew the communist military regime — and has kept itself in power since. A coalition of several ethnic groups that was controlled by the ethnic minority Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the EPRDF party has stunted political opposition by jailing dissidents, coercing citizens into joining the party and reportedly committing electoral fraud. Its regular elections thus have not shaken its widespread reputation as an authoritarian state. To hold truly competitive elections in 2020, Ethiopia may need to repeal certain oppressive laws and stop the EPRDF from siphoning off state resources to distribute to its supporters in exchange for power. At the same time, the coalition party must manage hard-liners within the coalition to prevent them from undermining efforts at democracy, as suggested by political scientist Milan Svolik’s work on authoritarian governance. 1. Laws limiting free association and free speech In 2005, after the EPRDF liberalized the country’s political landscape, two opposition coalitions won an unprecedented number of seats, together gaining about a quarter of the seats in the national Parliament. Although the EPRDF remained in power, it cracked down again. The government detained opposition politicians and sent security forces to fire on protesters. Further, it passed laws that criminalized dissent and changed the country’s electoral system to give itself more likely seats. As part of the crackdown, the EPRDF passed two notably repressive laws. The 2009 Charities and Societies Act prohibited any organization from funding its human rights work by receiving more than 10 percent of that budget from abroad. The 2009 Anti-Terrorism Proclamation uses what human rights groups consider an “an overly broad and vague definition of terrorism” to curtail freedom of speech, allowing the government to arrest citizens for criticizing the government. The ruling party used the Charities and Societies law to harass groups such as the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association and the Human Rights Council, even freezing their bank accounts. It used the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to silence journalists, political opposition members and dissident bloggers. Abiy has begun talks to reform or repeal both of these laws. 2. Distributing largesse to party members — while punishing dissenters After the troubled 2005 elections, the government delayed the country’s regional and local elections for two years. In that time, the EPRDF expanded its party membership fourfold through a combination of carrots and sticks. The party also increased the number of elected local positions, diluting the political opposition’s power, since it didn’t have enough people to run for every seat. As a result, in the 2008 elections, the EPRDF won more than 99.9 percent of the 3.5 million positions governing the local positions in the kebele (the smallest administrative unit, akin to a neighborhood) and woreda (district) elections. These officials distribute government goods such as seeds, fertilizer, credit and other agricultural basics — and are in charge of community courts, local prisons and sometimes local militia. That means that local EPRDF officials could reward supporters and punish opponents — either by offering or refusing goods, or implicitly threatening police monitoring and harassment. And according to a Human Rights Watch investigation, that’s what happened. Kebele officials discriminated against those who were not members of the EPRDF. This pattern of patronage has made it difficult to build successful opposition parties, since the opposition could neither reward party loyalty nor protect against punishment, as the EPRDF could. If the EPRDF wants competitive democratic elections, it would have to dismantle this government-backed system of patronage and punishment. But the tentative reform agenda Abiy has put forward has already disturbed some powerful party insiders. 3. The TPLF — used to being in charge — isn’t happy Abiy’s promises have been greeted by jubilant crowds in Ethiopia and internationally. But to succeed, he has to bring along the rest of his ruling coalition. The EPRDF is a multiethnic coalition comprising four main political parties — the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO), the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement and the TPLF. That last controlled the coalition until Abiy, an Oromo, stepped in. The TPLF has publicly criticized a peace deal that Abiy brokered, which ended two decades of war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. And observers say that the TPLF opposes Abiy’s efforts to untangle the party’s involvement with certain industries and economic sectors controlled by the party, and which party members have used to line their pockets or reward “military cronies.” The TPLF could block reforms — serving as what political scientist George Tsebelis calls a “veto player.” 4. Empowering political opposition The anti-government protests have wrought serious change and may have the infrastructure to start building healthy opposition parties. But they’re not fully developed yet. After decades of being shut out of power, jailed, silenced and attacked, they aren’t yet able to compete fairly with the well-resourced and dominant EPRDF. If Abiy or the international community want free and fair elections, they need to invest in and help political dissidents who are trying to build political parties and end the local administrative monopoly on government support. And as political scientist Stephen Brown showed a decade ago, the international community can’t build democracy in the face of active government repression and domestic conditions that discourage competition. The possibility of free, fair and competitive elections in Ethiopia depends on how dedicated the EPRDF may be to dismantling the barriers it has spent decades building up. Correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article said that Abiy was the first non-Tigrayan prime minister since the rise of the EPRDF. That is incorrect; he is the first Oromo prime minister. We regret the error.  Hilary Matfess (@HilaryMatfess) is a PhD student at Yale University and  author of “Women and the War on Boko Haram: Wives, Weapons, Witnesses.”	800	"[{""start"": 558, ""end"": 713, ""text"": ""biy told a group of thousands of expatriate Ethiopian dissidents that his “ultimate goal is to ensure that a democratic election takes place in Ethiopia."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3196, ""end"": 3255, ""text"": ""Abiy has begun talks to reform or repeal both of these laws"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	778	2023-04-27T15:32:45.590166Z	2023-04-27T15:32:45.590240Z	315.075
"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops into the northern Tigray province on Wednesday and declared a ""military confrontation"" after the regional government attacked a federal military base there. In a statement, Abiy’s office accused the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the renegade province’s ruling party, of attempting to steal artillery and other military equipment during the attack. “The last red line has been crossed with this morning’s attacks and the federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,” Abiy’s office said in the statement, citing what it called months of provocation and incitement. It said the mission was to “save the country and the region from spiraling instability.” Fighting in the continent’s second-most-populous country could destabilize the entire sensitive Horn of Africa region. Citing diplomatic sources, Reuters reported heavy fighting in the mountainous province. International pressure began to mount amid concerns that civilians could get caught in the middle of the fighting. The U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa called for an “immediate de-escalation of the current situation in Tigray.” Britain also called for restraint and issued an updated advisory to travelers to exercise extreme caution in Tigray and the neighboring northern Amhara region amid reports of clashes, it said. Ethiopia’s Council of Ministers declared a six-month state of emergency in Tigray, asserting federal authority over the region. The TPLF once dominated Ethiopia’s ruling coalition before Abiy took office in 2018 and the party was sidelined. Tensions with Tigray escalated in recent months after the region went ahead with its own local elections even though all polls were suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. On Oct. 7, Ethiopian lawmakers voted to withhold budget support from Tigray, a move that one Tigrayan official said was “tantamount to a declaration of war.” Most of Ethiopia’s military equipment is in Tigray because of a long-running war against neighboring Eritrea, which ended in 2018, when the countries signed a peace deal. Now, Abiy, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his reform efforts in Ethiopia and peace overtures to Eritrea, is trying to dislodge the Tigrayan-linked old guard elements from the military. A statement on Tigray TV attributed to the regional government accused the federal government of deploying troops to “invade Tigray to cow the people of Tigray into submission by force,” the Associated Press reported. It said the regional government had started to oppose the federal government to avert more destructive measures.” It warned of “proportional measures” for any damage to people or property. “This war is the worst possible outcome of tensions that have been brewing,” said William Davison, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. “Given Tigray’s relatively strong security position, the conflict may well be protracted and disastrous,” he said. A war could “seriously strain an Ethiopian state already buffeted by multiple grave political challenges and could send shock waves into the Horn of Africa region and beyond,” he added. Conflict in Tigray would further increase instability in Ethiopia and add to a host of recent crises that Abiy’s government has faced, including tensions with Egypt over an Ethiopian dam project on the Blue Nile and a locust outbreak across East Africa. As the country has opened and political reforms have taken hold, ethnic and other political violence has also flared up. At least 54 people from the ethnic Amhara group were killed in a schoolyard by rebels Sunday, according to Amnesty International. The government blamed the Oromo Liberation Army for the attack in the far western part of Oromia near the border with South Sudan. Tigrayans dominated Ethiopian politics after helping to oust a Marxist government in 1991, but their influence has waned under Abiy, and they quit his ruling coalition last year. Tigray’s population makes up about 7 percent of Ethiopia’s 108 million people but has a well-armed regional paramilitary led by former national army generals and is wealthier than most regions."	799	"[{""start"": 2132, ""end"": 2324, ""text"": ""Now, Abiy, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his reform efforts in Ethiopia and peace overtures to Eritrea, is trying to dislodge the Tigrayan-linked old guard elements from the military."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	777	2023-04-27T15:27:28.540228Z	2023-04-27T15:27:28.540371Z	193.321
2018 has been a rough year for the world. Autocrats seized control; terrorism and hate crimes are on the rise; and scientists say climate change is now almost certain to have catastrophic effects. And then there’s Yemen. Even so, there were a couple of bright spots. Since it’s Thanksgiving, we thought we’d take stock of a couple of foreign policy trends, shifts and happenings that left us smiling: 1. Europe’s now got a really strong data protection plan in place The General Data Protection Regulation, better known by its acronym GDPR, went into effect earlier this year. Nearly six years in the making, the GDPR lays out strong rules for what companies can do with your data. It limits what businesses can do and gives users much more control over the information they put online. Under the GDPR, companies must tell users what information is being collected, how it’s being used, how long it will be retained. Though it only protects the data of Europeans, it may reshape how big companies operate more broadly. Privacy advocates quibble with some parts of the framework. But in general, they hail it as the most significant data protection breakthrough ever. 2. Ethiopia and Eritrea came to a groundbreaking peace. Oh, and Ethiopia appointed a female president. Ethiopia and Eritrea had been locked in conflict for nearly two decades. The Economist described it as a “cold war that once seemed irresolvable.” The struggle was nominally over contested land at the border of the two countries. Over the years, Ethiopia and Eritrea sent thousands of troops to the border and armed each other’s rebels. But this summer, the two countries made peace and restored normal relations, easing tension around the region. “There is a wind of hope blowing in the Horn of Africa,” U.N. Secretary General António Guterres told journalists after the signing of the peace accord. “It is not only the peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea — it is the fact that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow we will have, here in Saudi Arabia, the president of Djibouti and the president of Eritrea — two countries that have also been at odds with each other.” The peace comes against a backdrop of unprecedented changes in Ethiopia’s once authoritarian government, including prisoner releases, economic opening and opposition figures allowed back in the country. Most dramatically has been the appointment of women in several top posts, including half the cabinet ministers, the head of the Supreme Court and even the president of the country, the largely ceremonial head of state. 3. After six decades, the remains of more than 50 U.S. service members were returned to the United States from North Korea Nearly 8,000 U.S. troops are unaccounted for from the Korean War. This summer, North Korea returned the remains of what is believed to be about 50 service members. (U.S. officials are still working to identify them.) Vice President Pence called it “tangible progress in our efforts to keep peace on the Korean Peninsula.” But for families who lost their loved ones, it means something more personal: “You just cannot fathom the suffering that these families endure,” Sherri Steward, who lost her father and uncle during the Korean War, told AARP. “The Korean War ended for the young men who perished there, but for families of those whose remains have not been recovered, the Korean War never has ended.” 4. The #MeToo movement went global A little more than a year ago, the New York Times and New Yorker published stories about Harvey Weinstein, a powerful Hollywood producer who allegedly sexually harassed and assaulted dozens of women with impunity. That story sparked an international movement. Around the world, women shared their stories. In Britain, the “Westminster dossier,” an online spreadsheet, exposed the alleged misconduct of more than 40 politicians. In Japan, journalist Shiori Ito publicly accused a prominent journalist of rape. In Australia, television personality Don Burke (often described as the country’s “Weinstein”) was accused of bullying and harassment by several current and former employees. In China, several prominent professors and television producers stepped down after accusations. Even in conservative Indonesia, a woman was able to successfully push for the prosecution of the man who assaulted her after she obtained video footage. As my colleagues wrote on the first anniversary of the movement: “From Stockholm to Seoul, from Toronto to Tokyo, a torrent of accusations has poured forth. Survivors spoke out, and many were taken seriously. Powerful men lost their jobs. A few went to prison. How diverse societies — some liberal, others conservative — saw sexual harassment seemed to be changing.” 5. The price of solar panels fell — a lot It may be one of the only bits of good news in the fight against climate change this year: The price of solar panels is falling even faster than experts expected. Jenny Chase, an expert on solar panel pricing, said the technology has gotten better faster than expected. As a result, solar panel installations have skyrocketed. Solar panels, of course, tap a renewable energy resource and don’t produce greenhouse gasses. If we want to slow the production of carbon dioxide, experts say solar energy will have to be part of the solution. “Solar power is going to dominate the energy sector this century,” Ars Technica wrote earlier this year. “The question is just how quickly it will bring down costs and take over the world. Yet again, the answer seems to be: quicker than people thought.” 6. After two weeks and an ambitious international effort, 17 Thai teenagers and their soccer coach were rescued from a cave One day in July, a group of 13 Thai high schoolers hiked to Tham Luang cave for an afternoon of exploration. They’d been there before and were planning to spend just an hour inside before trekking home for a birthday party. They wouldn’t leave the cave for nearly two weeks after a sudden flood trapped the boys (some of whom couldn’t swim!) in the flooded darkness. Getting them out took a daring, international rescue. “We didn’t think the mission would be this successful,” Thai Navy Seals leader Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yuukongkaew told the BBC. When they began the rescue operation, they had only “a little bit of hope that they might still be alive,” he said. “In the end that tiny bit of hope became reality.” 7. The royal wedding made us forget Even with all the distractions, it was hard to look away. This summer, Prince Harry married American actress Meghan Markle. By royal standards, the pair had somewhat unconventional nuptials, with a gospel choir and the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church presiding. It was glitzy, glamorous and all over the news, a fairy tale that offered a rare respite from the grim headlines.	798	"[{""start"": 1167, ""end"": 1221, ""text"": ""2.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — Ethiopia’s government approved a draft law Saturday to end a six-month state of emergency two months early, the latest sign of easing tensions under a new prime minister. The state of emergency, which prohibited most gatherings and gave increased power to security forces, was declared following the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn as prime minister in February. At the time, widespread strikes — objecting to the slow pace of political prisoner releases — disrupted supply and transportation links to the capital, Addis Ababa. But since being selected by the ruling party and taking office in April, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has helped bring greater stability. He has freed thousands of prisoners and toured the country listening to people’s grievances. He has also reached out to opposition figures both inside and outside Ethiopia. A number of opposition figures and experts have been cautiously hopeful that he seeks to bring real democratic reform. “I am optimistic about Abiy; this measure is really encouraging, even though it should have been lifted earlier,” said Atnafu Berhane, a blogger who spent years in jail for his writings, was released and then detained briefly under the state of emergency. “Once again he did the right thing; it’s a good sign.” Abiy’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, announced Saturday on Twitter that the Council of Ministers had “reviewed the security situation of the country. It noted that law & order has been restored. It has approved a draft law that lifts the State of Emergency.” Parliament, which is entirely controlled by the ruling party coalition, is expected to approve the law. This was the second state of emergency declared in as many years in Ethi­o­pia, Africa’s second-largest country by population and a key U.S. partner in the fight against extremists in the Horn of Africa. The Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups, which make up two-thirds of Ethiopia’s population, have been protesting the government over the lack of jobs and lack of political freedom. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands imprisoned. Abiy, an Oromo, is one of the youngest leaders on the continent at 41. Among the prisoners he has released is Andargachew Tsige, a British citizen and leader of the opposition Ginbot 7, which the government had branded a terrorist group. Andargachew, who was arrested by Yemeni authorities in 2014 and turned over to Ethi­o­pia, returned to Britain on Friday. While it has long had the trappings of a democracy, including elections and a parliament, Ethi­o­pia has functioned as an authoritarian state with a ruling party coalition backed by a powerful military. The last two elections saw almost no opposition presence in Parliament. Abiy has reached out to the opposition and encouraged them to return to politics. On Friday, he gave a speech to the military that made clear it had no role in the civilian politics of the country. “We will face chaos if the army involves itself in party politics from A to Z or if it does so remotely, like proxy war, to influence outcomes,” he said. “The army should be able to continue serving under the party that is elected by the people.” paul.schemm@washpost.com	797	"[{""start"": 631, ""end"": 691, ""text"": ""Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has helped bring greater stability"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 693, ""end"": 864, ""text"": ""He has freed thousands of prisoners and toured the country listening to people’s grievances.

The first commercial flight from Ethiopia to Eritrea in 20 years took place earlier this week, signifying a historic shift in relations between the two countries, previously stalled in a rivalrous state of “no war, no peace.” The flight followed a meeting earlier this month between Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. The demonstrably warm encounter — including televised embraces and shared laughter between the two leaders — led to normalized ties between the two countries, including the reintroduction of commercial flight and direct phone calls between citizens of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Other important moves have followed, including Eritrea’s withdrawal of troops from the militarized border with Ethiopia. The two nations in the Horn of Africa have disputed the border demarcation for decades, the site of a border war from 1998-2000, during which almost 100,000 people died. A former Ethiopian province, Eritrea struggled for 30 years to seek independence from Ethiopia; the international community finally recognized Eritrea as an independent country in 1993, following a near-unanimous popular referendum for Eritrean independence. This month’s historic developments in Ethiopia and Eritrea offer a moment to learn more about the forces that shaped the two contemporary states. In this week’s installment of the African Politics Summer Reading Spectacular, we share insights from a new book by Boston University political scientist Michael Woldemariam: “Insurgent Fragmentation in the Horn of Africa: Rebellion and Its Discontents.” Political parties leading Ethiopia and Eritrea were previously rebel organizations. Ethiopia’s ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), originally formed as a rebel group fighting the Derg, Ethiopia’s military regime ousted by the EPRDF in 1991. Eritrea’s ruling party, the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice, formed out of a rebel organization, the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, which fought for Eritrea’s independence. Woldemariam’s book draws from the Ethiopian and Eritrean cases (as well as the Somalia case) to study why rebellions come apart, or “fragment.” He defines his core concept, rebel fragmentation, as “the splitting of rebel organizations into politically distinct, mutually exclusive entities, where these entities create a new rebel organization, join an existing organization, or join forces with the incumbent government.” Why does it matter if rebel organizations come apart? Most obviously, rebel fragmentation is important to the survival of rebellions and subsequently, their eventual success or failure. Woldemariam reviews the broad literature on rebel fragmentation to identify other, perhaps less obvious, reasons: rebel fragmentation can influence the intensity of civil war violence, impact of violence against civilians, the duration of civil wars, state failure and postwar behavior of insurgent groups, e.g., when they have transitioned into political parties. To study rebel fragmentation, Woldemariam compiled an original data set on 171 African rebel organizations that operated between 1946 and 2006. In his analysis of publicly available sources, Woldemariam finds a third of these rebel organizations fragmented at least once, with some fragmenting multiple times. Woldemariam conducted years of research in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan, Europe and North America. His deep case studies of Ethiopian and Eritrean rebel organizations draw on more than 85 interviews with ex-combatants, ex-government officials and civilians who lived through the conflict, as well as thousands of pages of archival material. One chapter in the book studies the Somali civil war, drawing on more than 40 interviews with government officials, rebel organization veterans and NGO employees who engaged with rebel organizations. Woldemariam’s aim in “Insurgent Fragmentation” is to understand why rebel organizations come apart. He argues that territorial gains or losses lead rebel organizations to fragment. Gaining territory can erode cooperation and lead to factional infighting in rebel organizations while losing territory can undermine the credibility of the rebel organization’s ability to achieve its goals. Stalemates, on the other hand, lead to greater cohesion and unity in rebel organizations. Using the example of the Eritrean Liberation Front (referred to by Eritreans as “Jebha”), Woldemariam shows territorial losses in 1967 led to commitment problems and ideological struggles within Jebha whereas rapid territorial gains in 1975 triggered infighting within Jebha’s leadership. By contrast, Woldemariam finds no factionalism or fragmentation between 1971 and 1973, when Jebha experienced a territorial stalemate. While “Insurgent Fragmentation in the Horn of Africa” may not speak much to the recent thaw in relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia, Woldemariam’s expertise in the region is deep and compelling. A solid study of rebel organizations, “Insurgent Fragmentation” offers accessible histories of rebel organizations in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia (as well as a history of the formation of the Eritrean state, in Chapter 3). Beyond the book, a prescient research article by Woldemariam published earlier this year suggested the recent selection of Ethiopia’s Abiy created an opportunity for improved Ethiopia-Eritrea relations. Anyone interested in learning more about either country, their relations to each other or about rebel organizations more broadly, should follow his work.	795	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 223, ""text"": ""he first commercial flight from Ethiopia to Eritrea in 20 years took place earlier this week, signifying a historic shift in relations between the two countries, previously stalled in a rivalrous state of “no war, no peace"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 358, ""end"": 631, ""text"": ""The demonstrably warm encounter — including televised embraces and shared laughter between the two leaders — led to normalized ties between the two countries, including the reintroduction of commercial flight and direct phone calls between citizens of Ethiopia and Eritrea."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5208, ""end"": 5410, ""text"": ""Beyond the book, a prescient research article by Woldemariam published earlier this year suggested the recent selection of Ethiopia’s Abiy created an opportunity for improved Ethiopia-Eritrea relations."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5208, ""end"": 5410, ""text"": ""Beyond the book, a prescient research article by Woldemariam published earlier this year suggested the recent selection of Ethiopia’s Abiy created an opportunity for improved Ethiopia-Eritrea relations."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	773	2023-04-27T15:04:40.097666Z	2023-04-27T15:04:40.097830Z	445.56
By almost any measure, 2018 has been a disastrous year for democracy. Authoritarian leaders have made decisive moves to tighten their grip on power by eroding practices indispensable to a functioning democracy, such as the rule of law and a free press, and blithely ignoring or violently suppressing mass protests in places such as Hungary, Nicaragua, the Philippines and elsewhere. And yet, there are parts of the world where, quite unexpectedly, the struggle for democratic reform made giant strides — a reminder that the right mix of activism, leadership and circumstances can suddenly change the course of history. The good news came from starkly different countries, where undemocratic practices had been playing out in unique ways. Remarkably, whether toppling autocrats or reversing corrosive practices, the bold leaders and committed activists that shocked the system managed to achieve their goals without violence. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the year came in Ethiopia, a country of 100 million people and a solidly authoritarian past. Its jails teemed with political prisoners and journalists, and regime critics knew that the safest place was in exile. Since overthrowing a military regime in 1991, the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) monopolized power, profited from corruption, crushed its critics and blatantly favored the privileged ethnic Tigray minority. But then, in March, tensions within the EPRDF produced something of an internal coup, and the party chose Abiy Ahmed as its new chairman, making him prime minister and the first member of the oppressed Oromo minority to hold the post. His appointment ushered in changes that Ethiopians at home and abroad could hardly believe. Abiy freed thousands of political prisoners. He released jailed journalists — not a single one remains in prison, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists — and ended a decades-old war with neighboring Eritrea. The euphoria that gripped Ethiopia, as opposition leaders started returning home, spread to the diaspora. Abiy met with a hero’s welcome during his travels to exiled Ethiopian communities. In a meeting with Ethiopian dissidents in the United States he explained his vision: The next step, he declared, is a “democratic election.” Abiy and Ethiopia face enormous challenges. Economic turmoil and ethnic conflict could yet lie ahead. But the prime minister also enjoys an extraordinary amount of support. His push for fair elections, his tolerance of dissent, and his selection of women as cabinet officers, the head of the Supreme Court, and ceremonial president all signal a more democratic future. Armenia has experienced a similarly dramatic turnaround. When President Serzh Sargsyan, already in office for a decade, staged a power grab by changing the constitution and becoming prime minister, the journalist-turned-activist Nikol Pashinyan leveraged the people’s anger to drastically change the country’s direction. Pashinyan led a massive march followed by crippling demonstrations, paralyzing the country until the parliament — which had named Sargsyan prime minister — finally relented. The nonviolent people power of Armenians forced Sargsyan to resign and persuaded legislators to name Pashinyan prime minister. But the biggest shift was still to come. A week ago, Armenians elected a new parliament, handing Pashinyan’s bloc an astonishing 70 percent of the vote. The previous ruling party, Sargsyan’s Republicans, didn’t even manage the 5 percent minimum required to enter parliament. Bolstered by the vote of confidence, Pashinyan has now launched a comprehensive anti-corruption campaign aimed at cleaning up the system of government. Two continents and an ocean away, the people of Peru also showed their appetite for change. Peruvians have long suffered from endemic corruption at the highest levels. But then the giant Odebrecht bribery scandal, which has played out across Latin America, revealed a series of new scandals. Every former Peruvian president going back several decades is now either in prison or under investigation. Last March, when President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was forced to resign over bribery allegations, Peru’s ambassador to Canada, Martin Vizcarra, got word he should hurry home: As the largely powerless first vice president, he was next in the line of succession. When Vizcarra arrived on a commercial flight and took the oath of office, most Peruvians had barely heard of him. But his accidental presidency was about to take a dramatic turn. Journalists discovered recordings of judges negotiating sentences and court appointments in exchange for favors, infuriating the public. The president found his cause, staking his presidency on uprooting corrupt practices. Peruvians stood solidly behind him. On Dec. 9, voters endorsed his plan in a nationwide referendum, overwhelmingly approving plans to change the ways judges and prosecutors are appointed, tighten campaign finance laws and ban congressional reelection. Vizcarra is now very popular, but his path ahead is also filled with potential traps, not least the risk of disappointing a population that had grown jaded after repeated scandals. These countries and their leaders still face dangerous obstacles ahead along the path to a durable liberal democracy. Their experiments could still fail. But the very fact that they have managed to make meaningful democratic strides against such steep odds should give encouragement to those battling the forces of damaging corruption and creeping authoritarianism in other places.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was announced as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, with the committee that decides the awards singling out his efforts to achieve peace with neighboring country Eritrea. But notably, the prize was not awarded to Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, Abiy’s partner in the talks. Instead, Nobel Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen simply acknowledged that “peace does not arise from the actions of one party alone” and said that they hope the “peace agreement will help to bring about positive change for the entire populations of Ethiopia and Eritrea.” In some years, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to multiple parties for their work trying to end a conflict. In 1994, for example, the prize was awarded to Israel’s Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, as well as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. But the decision to award the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize only to Ethiopia’s Abiy was hardly surprising. Eritrea’s Isaias leads one of the most repressive military dictatorships in the world; his government has been compared to North Korea and accused of possible crimes against humanity. And even though he reached an agreement with Abiy in Eritrea’s capital last year to end the conflict between the two nations, in practice the agreement remains largely unimplemented, and there have been little visible benefits for Eritreans. “I think there was a lot of hope in Eritrea,” said Laetitia Bader, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. “But very quickly, Eritreans saw that things were not changing on the ground.” Vanessa Tsehaye, an Eritrean activist based in London, noted, “I’d say it has brought no positive developments for the Eritrean people, because the lived reality is the same more than a year after the peace deal.” The conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia stretches back decades. After European powers left occupied Eritrea in 1951, landlocked Ethiopia claimed the land of its coastal neighbor, eventually resulting in a civil war that started in 1961 and lasted three decades. In 1991, Eritrean forces helped overthrow the communist-led government in Ethiopia, and two years later, Eritreans voted for independence. However, the two nations did not reach an agreement on the border between them, and in 1998, small-scale border incidents around the town of Badme grew into a full-fledged conflict. It’s estimated that almost 100,000 people died, and after it ended, Ethiopian troops had control of Badme and other disputed areas. As part of a peace agreement brokered in Algiers, in 2000, a commission cited colonial-era documents to rule that the land around Badme was part of Eritrea. But Ethiopia did not agree to the arbitrated border, and the two sides remained in a standoff. Their relationship was dubbed “no war, no peace,” which meant that diplomatic, trade and transport ties were severed, and the countries remained on a war footing, clashing repeatedly and supporting rival rebel groups. Abiy, a former intelligence officer who had taken part in the operations to drive Eritreans out of Badme, took office as Ethiopia’s prime minister in April 2018 and almost immediately began changes in the country, which had long been ruled by authoritarian governments. On June 5, 2018, Abiy made a key pledge to accept the peace agreement with Eritrea and withdraw Ethiopian troops from occupied territory. Within weeks, Isaias responded by saying that both nations yearned for peace. Just a month after Abiy’s announcement on July 8, the Ethiopian leader touched down at the airport in Eritrea’s capital Asmara, where he was greeted by Isaias. The leaders embraced and later announced they would reopen embassies, allow direct communications and restore transport links. “Love is greater than modern weapons like tanks and missiles,” Abiy said. “Love can win hearts, and we have seen a great deal of it today here in Asmara.” Despite the signs of goodwill, critics say not much has changed between the two nations. Among the Eritrean diaspora, many voiced disapproval for the Nobel Peace Prize focusing on the agreement with Eritrea when so little had changed in practice. “I didn’t know one could win a peace award without achieving peace!” Selam Kidane, a London-based activist wrote on Twitter. Border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea were opened last year, but Eritrea soon closed the border again. Analysts suspect that Eritrea, which has virtually complete control over its citizens, is delaying because of fears about wider reform. Isaias, a former freedom fighter, has led the country since 1993, and his government has left no room for opposition. In 2015, the United Nations released the results of a year-long investigation into human rights in the country, finding “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations,” including extrajudicial killing, torture and forced labor. Bader said that there was little evidence that there had been any positive change to some of the most restrictive elements, such as the arbitrary arrest of people for perceived political crimes, or the indefinite national service that sees many Eritreans permanently conscripted to the military. “The government has often argued that it was the ‘no war, no peace’ situation with Ethiopia was what forced it to conscript its whole population,” Bader said. Jeffrey Smith, the director of Vanguard Africa, said that he viewed the Nobel Prize as “encouraging Prime Minister Ahmed and the new regime in Ethiopia as much if not more than it is about the progress already made.” But for activists such as Tsehaye, the peace deal had helped legitimize Isaias, the leader of an isolated and repressive nation of 5 million people on the world stage. The Eritrean leader had traveled with Abiy to foreign nations, and the United Nations lifted sanctions on Eritrea. “Peace is always a good thing, it’s never something that we should be against,” Tsehaye said, “but we need to understand peace beyond its literal meaning of no war.” Discover something new: We’ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.

Hulgize Kassa, a 52-year-old from Raleigh, N.C., earned his spot at the front of the line. The father of two camped outside Walter E. Washington Convention Center starting at midnight Friday, watching as Ethiopians from as far as Colorado and Texas arrived with boxes of food, speakers and selfie sticks. By 7  a.m. Saturday, thousands had gathered in the streets spanning Mount Vernon Place to N Street, honking car horns and sharing food. Most wore T-shirts emblazoned with the face of their homeland’s newly minted prime minister, Abiy Ahmed. In the three months since his rise to power, the 41-year-old politician has introduced sweeping changes to Ethiopia, lifting a state of emergency, brokering peace with neighboring Eritrea and releasing hundreds of political prisoners. These dramatic steps toward liberalization have sparked “Abiy-mania” within the Ethiopian diaspora in the United States, which, for decades, stood among the fiercest critics of the ruling party’s autocratic regime. Abiy is in the United States to visit and speak to members of the diaspora. The Washington area is home to some 300,000 Ethiopians, making it the largest community outside the African country. “I want to hug him. He’s a hugger, I know, so I want to hug him,” said Kassa, a researcher at North Carolina State University. When Kassa first came to the United States in 2000, he never thought he would go back to his homeland. But Abiy’s ascension has changed his mind, he said. He plans to visit his home in the Amhara region next year, and bring his children, 12 and 14, with him. Abede Yimenu, a former major in the Ethiopian army, said he is also thinking of going home after having been away for 17 years. The 57-year-old from Dallas was in the District with three friends from his days in the Ethio­pian military, all clad in army uniforms, complete with black sunglasses. After fighting together in the Eritrean-Ethiopian War of 1998 to 2000, they left for the United States, unhappy with the oppression imposed by their government, Yimenu said. “This uniform,” he said, tapping his red beret. “It shows that we believe in this prime minister, and that we still love our country, and that we still need to serve our country.” Inside the convention center, the crowd spent the hours before Abiy’s arrival dancing, waving Ethiopian and Eritrean flags, and engaging in ululation, called ililta. For many, this is the first time they are seeing so many Ethiopians in a single place, save for being in the country itself. About 2:45 p.m., Abiy walked onstage in a white, glossy suit with gold accents, and the room exploded in cheers. Nearly everyone stood on their chairs, and many stayed there until they were told to sit. Religious leaders began the rally with prayers, praising Abiy and celebrating the future of the country. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser also addressed the crowd, declaring July 28 “Ethiopia Day” to rapturous applause. Abiy spoke primarily about unity. “Even though our fathers chose to divide us, we are saying no to division and hatred,” he said. He called on members of the diaspora to invest in Ethiopia and to return home — a message that seemed especially resonant for older members of the audience. Saba Gizau, a 58-year-old grandmother from Maryland, said that after two decades away from Ethiopia, she is ready to go back. Gizau, who had been at the convention center since 4 a.m. with her 56-year-old sister, works in sales at a Nordstrom department store and said she wants to impart what she knows about business to Ethiopians back home. “He invited us to come back to Ethiopia and help the country,” she said after Abiy’s speech, her eyes welling with tears. “He invited us, and I will be there.” Update: The quote from Prime Minister Abiy’s speech was changed to reflect a more detailed translation. rebecca.tan@washpost.com	792	"[{""start"": 534, ""end"": 780, ""text"": ""Abiy Ahmed.

"NAIROBI — A large death toll was feared as protests rocking Ethiopia's largest ethnic region continued Wednesday following the slaying of a popular singer, but details were scarce because of an Internet shutdown that made communication difficult. A police chief from the Oromia region, where most of the unrest took place, told Agence France-Presse that 81 people were killed in the past two days, including protesters and security forces. In a speech, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said only that ""several"" died. Three explosions were also reported Tuesday in the capital, Addis Ababa, with unspecified injuries and deaths. According to residents of multiple cities, protests over the death of Hachalu Hundessa continued across the region Wednesday. According to Hachalu's cousin Moti Hundessa, security forces in the town of Ambo, west of the capital, attempted to take Hachalu's body from his house, provoking a clash in which Hachalu's uncle was killed. ""Security forces tried to grab the body, and we fought with them to prevent them,"" Moti Hundessa said. ""Then they began shooting at us."" The medical director of the main hospital in Ambo confirmed the death and said he had seen multiple people with gunshot wounds come in Wednesday. Moti Hundessa said six people were killed by security forces in Ambo on Wednesday. Roads across Oromia were closed, many blocked by protesters chanting ""Abiy is our enemy,"" according to witnesses.  The demonstrations in Oromia as well as the capital were the latest indication of seething ethnic grievances that have repeatedly threatened to derail Ethiopia's transition to multiparty democracy. The government shut down the country's Internet on Tuesday — a common tactic during unrest — and has not yet restored the service. Hachalu, 34, belonged to the Oromo ethnic group, the country’s largest, and was shot in his car on the outskirts of Addis Ababa on Monday night. He died hours later in a hospital. Police said his assailants and their motives are unknown. His songs had galvanized a movement that succeeded in pushing Ethiopia’s previous prime minister to step down and opening the way for democratic reforms. Abiy, himself an Oromo, has released political prisoners, allowed greater freedom of speech and lifted a ban on several opposition groups, but many Oromos say they continue to be marginalized in the nation-building process. Abiy won last year’s Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in brokering an end to a decades-long standoff with Ethiopia’s northern neighbor, Eritrea. Domestic conflicts have proved harder to smooth over, and millions of Ethiopians remain internally displaced. “This is an act committed and inspired by domestic and foreign enemies in order to destabilize our peace and to stop us from achieving things that we started,” Abiy said Tuesday, in reference to Hachalu’s killing, without providing evidence. Long before the pandemic delayed parliamentary elections, which were scheduled for August, analysts had warned that simmering discontent in Oromia ahead of the vote could lead to large-scale bloodshed. A prominent Oromo media outlet reported that its founder, Jawar Mohammed, and Bekele Gerba, two of the country’s most prominent Oromo politicians, were arrested in connection with an argument over the burial of Hachalu’s body. Dozens of others were also arrested, the outlet said on Facebook. In a Facebook post just before the Internet was shut off, Jawar posted an impassioned tribute to Hachalu. “They did not just kill Hachalu. They shot at the heart of the Oromo Nation, once again !! . . . You can kill us, all of us, you can never ever stop us!! NEVER !!” he wrote. In October, Jawar warned on social media about government moves against him, prompting widespread protests across Oromia that left at least 100 dead. Officials in Abiy’s government have accused Jawar of using popular social media platforms to incite protests that turn violent, but Jawar has insisted that the government is always the instigator. “If the army is deployed, there will be blood. And that, well, it comes down to Abiy. If there is violence, it will begin at his command,” Jawar said in an interview with The Washington Post in March."	791	"[{""start"": 2156, ""end"": 2378, ""text"": ""Abiy, himself an Oromo, has released political prisoners, allowed greater freedom of speech and lifted a ban on several opposition groups, but many Oromos say they continue to be marginalized in the nation-building process"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2380, ""end"": 2524, ""text"": ""Abiy won last year’s Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in brokering an end to a decades-long standoff with Ethiopia’s northern neighbor, Eritrea"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	769	2023-04-27T14:35:24.246776Z	2023-04-27T14:35:24.246882Z	220.461
On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians rallied in the famous Meskel Square, located at the heart of the capital city, Addis Ababa. Citizen groups and human rights activists had organized the event to show support for Ethiopia’s reformist leader, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed — to recognize Abiy’s commitment to democratic change and encourage implementation. The demonstration was colorful. Many wore T-shirts bearing pictures of Abiy and his right-hand men. Others carried banners thanking Abiy for his agenda of togetherness. The prime minister wore a T-shirt with a picture of Nelson Mandela, which read, “We are not free until we all are free.” Abiy gave a rousing speech calling for national unity, and preaching love, coexistence, and democratic values. Minutes after he spoke, a grenade exploded. A rally organizer told The Washington Post the attacker had aimed at the stage, but a demonstrator grabbed his hand and changed the grenade’s direction. If that’s accurate, this may have been an attempt to assassinate a reformer who, since taking office two months ago, has lifted the state of emergency declared in February by the previous administration. So far, the explosion has killed two and injured an estimated 150. Here’s what these events mean for Ethiopia’s governance — and for the EPRDF, the four-party coalition that has tightly controlled Ethiopian politics for the last 27 years. Since 2015, the country’s two largest ethnic groups have been protesting their political marginalization, rights violations and economic injustices. More recently, Ethiopians have been protesting repressive treatment of the media and civil society, as embodied in Ethiopia’s anti-terrorism laws. All this boiled over in mass protests earlier this year as citizens chanted for the release of political prisoners and voiced concerns over deteriorating ethnic relations. Many criticized Ethiopia’s ethnic federal arrangement, which divides the nation into regions governed by particular ethnic groups — although the Tigrayan minority has run national politics, as I explained here at TMC in February, dominating the ruling coalition EPRDF. Since protests began in 2015, Human Rights Watch reports, security forces have killed hundreds; in 2017, the Ethiopian government admitted hundreds had been killed. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians have been internally displaced. Ethnic violence and local evictions of ethnic groups from regions governed by different groups are covered regularly by the daily news. This year, on Jan. 3, the governing EPRDF regime finally acceded to protesters’ demands. Under former prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, EPRDF announced political changes that included releasing thousands of political prisoners. But on Feb. 15, Desalegn announced his resignation — followed by jockeying within EPRDF over who would replace him. Until now, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) — representing the minority ethnic group that helped end an earlier civil war — has effectively dominated EPRDF, making other parties within the coalition less relevant. But the Oromo Peoples Democratic Organization (OPDO) and Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), two of four parties that make up the ruling coalition, had been pushing for changes. The two parties won the coalition’s chairmanship for Abiy, who chairs OPDO, effectively making him the new prime minister as of April 2. His election is viewed as the end of the TPLF’s dominance of EPRDF — and therefore of the country. Despite being part of the establishment, Abiy had been pushing for a new political direction. In his inaugural speech, Abiy called for reconciliation and apologized that peaceful protesters had been killed. Since taking charge, Abiy has freed most of Ethiopia’s remaining political prisoners. He has attempted to overhaul the security sector, which remains controlled by the TPLF. Abiy forced out long-serving EPRDF elites, and enabled young public servants and technocrats to rise into key posts within his administration. In an attempt to improve relations between the government and the people, Abiy has also traveled throughout the country, listening to grievances. As a longtime critic of the practice of evicting ethnic groups from different parts of the country, Abiy has suggested establishing a council of experts to study the federal arrangement, which is designed according to ethnic and linguistic lines. My research has shown this federal arrangement has ensured EPRDF’s survival as an authoritarian party. Beyond Ethiopia’s borders, Abiy has been trying to mend relations with neighboring countries in the hopes of facilitating trade and economic integration. The old guard isn’t happy, however. In a parliamentary session called by TPLF and its allies, parliamentarians representing the unhappy elites accused the prime minister of releasing “terrorists.” In a surprising response, Abiy acknowledged the terrorist acts committed by the government itself — and insisted that only through coming together and forgiveness could Ethiopia move forward. After the explosion, the prime minister addressed the nation, saying, “Those of you who planned and executed such an attack against your own people have failed yesterday, failed today and will fail tomorrow.” Immediately after Abiy spoke, state television announced that the government had arrested Addis Ababa’s deputy police commissioner, as well as other high officials within the federal police and intelligence services, so far charging more than 30 people related to the attacks. The U.S. government has sent FBI experts to help Ethiopian authorities investigation of the blast. Abiy now has the ammunition he needs to overhaul the security sector. Observers expect to see old guard elites purged from the governing coalition and Abiy’s opponents driven out of the police and military institutions.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — Ethiopia’s ruling party announced plans Tuesday to implement a long-moribund peace deal with Eritrea, opening the way for improved relations after 18 years of hostility. The surprise announcement also included plans to allow private sector involvement in industries long reserved for the state, in a major revision of economic policy. The moves are part of reforms being implemented by Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who was selected by the party in March after his predecessor resigned amid widespread unrest. Since becoming prime minister, Abiy has freed hundreds of prisoners and met with outlawed opposition figures, and on Tuesday, Parliament at his behest lifted a state of emergency two months early. At his inauguration, Abiy also had pledged to improve ties with Eritrea, but few expected as dramatic a move as came out of Tuesday’s meeting of the executive committee of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front. Eritrea was once part of Ethi­o­pia and fought for decades for its independence, which it finally achieved after helping rebels overthrow the communist Derg government in 1991. Initially, it had close ties with Ethiopia’s new rebel-formed government. In 1998, however, a dispute over the nondescript border town of Badme turned into a savage, year-and-a-half-long war that claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides. A peace agreement known as the Algiers accord was finally signed in 2000, and international arbitration awarded the village to Eritrea — but Ethi­o­pia balked at implementing the deal. The result was two decades of hostile stalemate with periodic clashes on the border, most recently in 2016 when hundreds were killed. Ethi­o­pia is also home to tens of thousands of Eritrean refugees and has lost access to its traditional outlets to the Red Sea along the Eritrean coast. With Ethi­o­pia announcing its willingness to pull out of Badme, the door is finally open for improved relations between the two countries, which share extensive links. “Ethiopia and Eritrea have the most unique cultural, historical and blood ties. The suffering on both sides is unspeakable because the peace process is deadlocked. This must change for the sake of our common good,” Fitsum Arega, the prime minister’s chief of staff, tweeted shortly before the announcement. Almost overshadowed by news that Ethi­o­pia could be reconciling with a historical enemy was what appeared to be a major shift in the country’s economic approach. While one of the fastest growing in Africa, Ethi­o­pia’s economy remains dominated by the state, with a very limited role for the private sector. Now private sector participation will be allowed in energy, telecommunications and aviation — all government monopolies — the party announced, although the state will still hold majority stakes. Other sectors, however, will be open to full private sector ownership, including railways, the sugar industry and hotels, said the announcement. Amid its high growth, Ethi­o­pia has been accumulating large amounts of debt even as job growth has faltered, contributing to the unrest. Inviting in the private sector appears to be an effort to rethink the country’s state-driven growth model and boost the economy. paul.schemm@washpost.com	789	"[{""start"": 11, ""end"": 195, ""text"": "", Ethi­o­pia — Ethiopia’s ruling party announced plans Tuesday to implement a long-moribund peace deal with Eritrea, opening the way for improved relations after 18 years of hostility."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 196, ""end"": 547, ""text"": ""The surprise announcement also included plans to allow private sector involvement in industries long reserved for the state, in a major revision of economic policy.

NAIROBI — President Trump’s speech at a rally in Ohio on Thursday night was typical in that it laced thoughts about current events together with criticism of his opponents. But his comments Thursday included a remark that caught the attention of many in Ethiopia, whose prime minister was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, largely for his work securing a peace deal with neighboring Eritrea after decades of hostilities. “I made a deal, I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said, ‘What, did I have something do with it?’ ” Trump asked the crowd. “Yeah,” Trump said, answering his own question. “But that’s the way it is.” Trump played no apparent role in the Eritrea peace deal, but Washington has played a convening role in another deal Ethio­pian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is seeking with Egypt that will regulate how quickly Ethi­o­pia can fill a new dam it has built in the upper reaches of the Nile River that has major implications for the flow of water Egypt relies on economically. The apparent conflation of the two led to widespread befuddlement on social media in Ethi­o­pia and elsewhere, though by and large the comments were not taken seriously. The U.S. Embassy in Ethi­o­pia referred reporters to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s remarks in October congratulating Abiy for his prize. The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday tweeted “Trump is confused” about why Abiy was awarded the prize. “He was talking about Egypt and Ethiopia,” a senior Ethio­pian government official told the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media on the matter. “President Trump really believes he avoided a war as such … but that was not the case.” Ministers from Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan, which controls a stretch of the Nile between its two sparring neighbors, will meet in Washington next week to discuss the ongoing impasse in talks concerning the dam. Ethiopia’s peace deal with Eritrea led to a reopening of borders and diplomatic relations. Eritrea was part of Ethi­o­pia until it seceded in 1993 and then fought a bloody war to retain its independence that began in 1998. The war resulted in at least 80,000 deaths. Eritrea still has mandatory conscription, which tens of thousands have sought to avoid by migrating to Europe and countries on the nearby Arabian peninsula. Trump, for his part, has rarely commented on African affairs, and while he is often criticized for neglecting the continent, he remains popular in Kenya and Nigeria, according to a recent poll that similarly neglected to survey most of the continent’s 54 countries. max.bearak@washpost.com	788	"[{""start"": 264, ""end"": 417, ""text"": ""whose prime minister was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, largely for his work securing a peace deal with neighboring Eritrea after decades of hostilities."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2009, ""end"": 2099, ""text"": ""Ethiopia’s peace deal with Eritrea led to a reopening of borders and diplomatic relations."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 768, ""end"": 1078, ""text"": ""ut Washington has played a convening role in another deal Ethio­pian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is seeking with Egypt that will regulate how quickly Ethi­o­pia can fill a new dam it has built in the upper reaches of the Nile River that has major implications for the flow of water Egypt relies on economically."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 768, ""end"": 1077, ""text"": ""but Washington has played a convening role in another deal Ethio­pian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is seeking with Egypt that will regulate how quickly Ethi­o­pia can fill a new dam it has built in the upper reaches of the Nile River that has major implications for the flow of water Egypt relies on economically"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	766	2023-04-27T13:55:17.698744Z	2023-04-27T13:55:17.698872Z	242.438
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — A coup attempt by a renegade general in one of Ethiopia’s largest regional states resulted in the death of four officials, including the national army’s chief of staff and the president of the region, the government announced Sunday. Gunmen attacked an executive meeting of the Amhara regional state in the city of Bahir Dar on Saturday evening, killing its president, Ambachew Mekonnen, and his top adviser and grievously injuring the regional attorney general. Hours later, in the capital Addis Ababa, the bodyguard of army chief of staff Gen. Seare Mekonnen opened fire on him, killing the general and an associate. Government spokeswoman Bilene Seyoum blamed the attacks on a recently amnestied brigadier general who had been imprisoned for his political views by the previous government several years before. “The coup attempt and attack was orchestrated by Brig. Gen. Asaminew Tsige, the Amhara peace and security head with other agents,” she told journalists. “He and his colleagues were given amnesty over the last year by the new administration amid efforts to integrate them back to regular life.” She said most of the perpetrators, including Seare’s bodyguard, were in custody and operations were underway to sweep up the remaining accomplices. The Amhara region was “currently under 100 percent control,” she said. Ethiopia, Africa’s second-largest country by population, is a key U.S. ally in the fight against terrorism in the Horn of Africa and an important source of stability in the restive region. The country’s politics have undergone a dramatic change over the past year with the arrival of a new reformist prime minister who has invited back exiled opposition politicians and guerrilla groups and freed thousands of political prisoners. Asaminew was imprisoned by the previous regime for his opposition to the government, and his release and appointment to head of security was part of the larger reconciliation process. The new freedoms, however, have allowed long-simmering tensions to rise to the surface, and millions have been displaced in ethnic-based land conflicts around the country. In 2018, with some 3 million driven from their homes, Ethiopia had the largest number of newly displaced people in the world. There has also been a great deal of political ferment in the ethnic-based regions that make up the country, with the rise of nationalist ethnic groups pushing for greater regional autonomy from the central government. As news of the coup attempt in Bahir Dar and the attack on the chief of staff’s home in the heart of the capital spread late Saturday, social media exploded with rumors and speculation over what was taking place. Within a few hours, access to the Internet was shut down, and army and police checkpoints were installed around the capital. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appeared on television at midnight dressed in military fatigues to call for calm and reassure the country that the situation was under control. Since coming to power, Abiy has made peace with longtime rival Eritrea and has been active in brokering peace deals between fractious neighbors in the region. Most recently, he has been active in mediating between the military transitional rulers in Sudan and protesters there. paul.schemm@washpost.com	787	"[{""start"": 1540, ""end"": 1780, ""text"": ""The country’s politics have undergone a dramatic change over the past year with the arrival of a new reformist prime minister who has invited back exiled opposition politicians and guerrilla groups and freed thousands of political prisoners"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1782, ""end"": 1965, ""text"": ""saminew was imprisoned by the previous regime for his opposition to the government, and his release and appointment to head of security was part of the larger reconciliation process."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2820, ""end"": 3148, ""text"": ""Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appeared on television at midnight dressed in military fatigues to call for calm and reassure the country that the situation was under control.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — An Ethiopian rebel group declared a unilateral cease-fire on Thursday after Parliament removed it from a list of banned terrorist groups as part of a reform drive led by the new prime minister. The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) has fought for autonomy for the Oromia region — Ethiopia’s largest — since 1993. It was designated a terrorist group by the government in 2008. “The temporary declaration of cease-fire will take us to the final declaration of bilateral cessation of hostilities once and for all and conclusion of the conflict,” the group said in a statement published by state-affiliated media. The move comes a week after Parliament ruled that the group, along with the secessionist Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) and the Ginbot 7 opposition movement, were no longer terrorist organizations. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in April, is spearheading a bold push to shake the African nation of 100 million people from decades of security-obsessed rule. Abiy has acknowledged and condemned widespread abuses by security forces, likening them to state terrorism, and, in the most stunning development yet, forged peace with sworn enemy Eritrea, ending a lengthy military standoff that followed a 1998-2000 border war in which 80,000 people are thought to have died. In Eritrea’s capital, Asmara, this week, the 41-year-old Abiy said the neighboring nations would resolve outstanding issues by “building bridges of love.” He has also rescinded a state of emergency and announced plans to partially open up the economy, including attracting foreign capital into the state-run telecom company and national airline. Also Thursday, the president of Ethiopia’s Somali region said his provincial government had released thousands of inmates who were jailed for their links to the ONLF. “Today, there is no single inmate jailed for involvement with the ONLF. We have released all prisoners under this reform drive,” said Abdi Mohamoud Omar, adding that the prisons were in the process of being turned into schools, hospitals and mosques. The shake-up by Abiy, a polyglot former soldier and a member of the Oromo ethnic group, has won plaudits from Asmara to Washington and drawn comparisons to the 1980s reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. However, it has also attracted opposition from hard-liners in the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the ethnic Tigrayan party that has dominated the government and the economy since taking power in 1991.	786	"[{""start"": 838, ""end"": 1007, ""text"": ""Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in April, is spearheading a bold push to shake the African nation of 100 million people from decades of security-obsessed rule"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1009, ""end"": 1319, ""text"": ""Abiy has acknowledged and condemned widespread abuses by security forces, likening them to state terrorism, and, in the most stunning development yet, forged peace with sworn enemy Eritrea, ending a lengthy military standoff that followed a 1998-2000 border war in which 80,000 people are thought to have died."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1320, ""end"": 1665, ""text"": ""In Eritrea’s capital, Asmara, this week, the 41-year-old Abiy said the neighboring nations would resolve outstanding issues by “building bridges of love.” He has also rescinded a state of emergency and announced plans to partially open up the economy, including attracting foreign capital into the state-run telecom company and national airline."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1666, ""end"": 1903, ""text"": ""Also Thursday, the president of Ethiopia’s Somali region said his provincial government had released thousands of inmates who were jailed for their links to the ONLF. “Today, there is no single inmate jailed for involvement with the ONLF"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	764	2023-04-27T13:50:16.792285Z	2023-04-27T13:50:16.792384Z	278.823
The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday lifted sanctions imposed on Eritrea nine years ago, rewarding its improved relations with Ethi­o­pia and other neighboring countries, though concerns about its human rights record remain. The unanimous Security Council decision immediately ended an arms embargo, a travel ban and an asset freeze on Eritrea and its leaders. It was hailed as a historic moment in the history of the conflicted Horn of Africa. The sanctions were put in place in 2009 after U.N. experts said Eritrea was arming and training al-Shabab and other militants seeking to undermine the government in Somalia. The Eritrean government denied the allegation and primarily attributed the sanctions to U.S. opposition. It has been several years since the United Nations has offered any evidence to support the claim against Eritrea. And, recently, the nation has reconciled with neighbors with which it had engaged in conflicts for many years. In July, Eritrea and Ethi­o­pia officially declared an end to two decades of hostilities. They agreed to open embassies and resume flights. A border dispute remains with Djibouti, where the United States maintains a military base. But the leaders of the two countries have met to discuss ways to settle their differences. Eritrea, which lies along the Red Sea, provides bases for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in their war against Shiite rebels in Yemen. It also has improved its relations with Europe, which is seeking to stanch the flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Africa. But even as the sanctions were lifted, the government in the capital, Asmara, expressed bitterness. “The Government of Eritrea welcomes this belated decision to redress injustice, almost a decade after nefarious acts were taken inculcating indefensible harm on the country,” tweeted Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel. After thanking those who argued against the “ignominious sanction,” Gebremeskel added: “But even as we turn the page of this dark chapter and focus on the future, we must ponder on, and take stock of, what transpired; why Eritrea was needlessly victimized; what were the dynamics that underpinned a travesty of international justice on this scale? “In the event, the UNSC shoulders a responsibility of effecting amends to the wrongs done; above and beyond the lifting of the sanctions. The Government and people of Eritrea will not thus abandon their efforts for truth and justice with the mere lifting of the sanctions.” Eritrea also has demanded compensation for the economic harm caused by the sanctions. The Security Council vote to lift the sanctions marked a reversal by the United States and France, two permanent members that earlier insisted that Eritrea first needed to demonstrate that it was improving its human rights record. The State Department’s most recent human rights report on Eritrea expressed concern over several abuses. They included politically motivated killings; people dying or disappearing after being detained by government forces; and lingering reports of torture inflicted on army deserters, national-service evaders, those trying to flee the country without travel documents and some religious groups. carol.morello@washpost.com	785	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 171, ""text"": ""N.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — A grenade was thrown Saturday at a massive rally in support of Ethiopia’s young new reformist leader, killing one and wounding dozens, but leaving the prime minister unharmed. Abiy Ahmed, 42, had just finished speaking to a rapturous audience of tens of thousands of supporters in the capital’s iconic Meskel square in the heart of the city when there was a sound of a bang. Footage shows the prime minister, who was wearing a yellow T-shirt with Nelson Mandela and the African continent on it, standing up and looking in the direction of the sound before being ushered away by security guards. Shortly after the attack, Abiy appeared grim-faced on television to say that “a few people” were killed and that the “well-orchestrated attack” was “cheap and unacceptable.” Health Minister Amir Aman later tweeted that one person had died of his wounds among the 155 reported wounded. “Love will win. Forgiveness will win. Killing is a sign of defeat. They failed yesterday. They failed today. They will fail tomorrow,” Abiy said. Rally organizer Seyoum Teshome told The Washington Post that he saw the attack unfold, and that the prime minister was saved by one of the demonstration’s participants. “Someone was trying to throw the grenade and then another person touched his hand so he missed the target and the grenade fell without reaching the stage,” he said. The blast came just as the master of ceremonies was welcoming viewers from abroad and said in English that “this is the day that Ethi­o­pia has become proud.” The sound of the live broadcast on state television cut after the blast, and people in the crowd could be seen craning their heads in the direction of the sound. Photos on social media after the attack showed scattered clothes on the ground, a few motionless bodies and people crying. Local media have quoted police in saying the incident is being treated as an assassination attempt. In a tweet following the attack, Abiy’s chief of staff Fitsum Arega promised that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. “We will overcome hate with love. Some whose heart is filled with hate attempted a grenade attack,” he said. “All the casualties are martyrs of love & peace.” In the aftermath of the attack, police scuffled with angry protesters and then cleared the square with tear gas, according to Agence France-Presse. The Associated Press said that nine police officials were later arrested, including the deputy head of the capital’s police commission, citing state broadcaster ETV. The man with the grenade was wearing a police uniform, witness Abraham Tilahun told the AP. Police officers nearby quickly restrained him, he said. “Then we heard the explosion.” Abiy, who was inaugurated in April, has embarked on a string of rapid reforms that have stunned the nation, including releasing tens of thousands of prisoners, replacing key generals in the army, dampening ethnic tensions in the country and promising to liberalize the economy. The rally was in part to express popular support for the prime minister's reforms, such as peace overtures to its once bitter enemy Eritrea, including promises to give up territory now held by Ethi­o­pia. The Eritrean ambassador to Japan, Estifanos Afwerki, said his country “strongly condemns the attempt to incite violence” at what he described as the first demonstration for peace in the history of Ethi­o­pia. Despite the tragedy at Meskel Square, spirits were high elsewhere in the city where crowds streaming away from the hours-long rally were cheering and wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Abiy’s face. paul.schemm@washpost.com	784	"[{""start"": 2710, ""end"": 2987, ""text"": ""Abiy, who was inaugurated in April, has embarked on a string of rapid reforms that have stunned the nation, including releasing tens of thousands of prisoners, replacing key generals in the army, dampening ethnic tensions in the country and promising to liberalize the economy."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	762	2023-04-27T13:43:24.365770Z	2023-04-27T13:43:24.365840Z	4.055
ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki landed in Ethiopia’s capital Saturday morning, following his Ethiopian counterpart’s groundbreaking trip to Asmara this month amid the warming ties between the once-rival nations. After a two-year war and an 18-year standoff, the two countries have suddenly agreed to restore diplomatic ties, end the state of war and reestablish long-severed transportation links in the wake of overtures last month by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. In a sign of the two countries’ new coordination, the visit was announced on Twitter at nearly the same time and the streets of Addis Ababa were festooned with Eritrean and Ethio­pian flags, side by side. Isaias was welcomed at the airport in Addis Ababa by a military marching band and traditional dancers, as Abiy had been in the Eritrean capital. Well-wishers lined Addis Ababa’s streets, waving both countries’ flags and chanting antiwar slogans. Eritrean state television superimposed the flags onto images of doves of peace. The two leaders signed a five-point peace agreement on Monday, and now roads will be reopened, telephone connections have been restored, and, on Wednesday, Ethiopian Airlines will have its first flight to Asmara in 20 years. After the decades of hostility, Ethiopia’s deputy prime minister, Demeke Mekonnen, said the time was right for peace. “Now I am an optimist. All of us have learned a lot, and I think he [Isaias] is also very much committed to going all the way,” he told The Washington Post in an interview. “We have paid a lot, both of us.” Eritrea fought for its independence from Ethiopia for 30 years, with Isaias serving as a leader of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) before becoming president after its 1993 independence. After the downfall of Ethiopia’s communist-led government, the leaders of newly born Eritrea and Ethiopia fell out in the 1990s over the border demarcation and economic issues such as currency. Despite the recent rapid improvement in relations, delicate negotiations lie ahead over those same issues that lay at the base of the original break. “In such conditions, it is better to start with the simplest ones,” said Demeke, explaining that the border and the economy would be tackled later. The breakthrough in relations appeared to come when Abiy on June 5 agreed to implement the 2002 arbitration agreement that ended the war and awarded key border territories to Eritrea such as the town of Badme. Two weeks later, Isaias responded favorably, and relations took off. However, according to Kjetil Tronvoll, an expert on the conflict from Oslo’s Bjorknes University College, it may have been more about Abiy himself, rather than his offer. The conflict between the two countries was in some ways a personal one between Isaias and Meles Zenawi, a former prime minister of Ethiopia who died in 2012. Abiy’s rise in power has been accompanied by the marginalization of Meles’s once-dominant faction of the ruling party, called the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, which made the Ethiopian government more palatable to Isaias, Tronvoll explained. “Basically, in the mind-set of Isaias and EPLF, he won the war, he got Badme, and TPLF has ‘lost power’ in Ethiopia,” he said. “Isaias is the ‘last man standing’ — and he proved them all that his strategy was the correct one.” In his speech accepting Abiy’s overture, Isaias exulted over what he saw as the Ethiopian people’s rejection of the TPLF. “But although it will require time and efforts to remove the TPLF’s toxic and malignant legacy and to bring about a congenial climate, the positive direction that has been set in motion is crystal clear,” he said. “The TPLF clique and other vultures are dumbfounded by the ongoing changes.” The TPLF initially responded with apparent annoyance at Abiy’s overtures, insisting that it had to be involved in any peace agreement with Eritrea, but it subsequently issued a statement supporting the agreement signed in Asmara. A normalization between the two countries will be a major boon for both, especially in cross-border trade. It also solves Ethiopia’s perennial problem of access to the Red Sea, from which it was cut off after Eritrea’s independence. Currently, 95 percent of Ethiopia’s foreign trade goes through the port in neighboring Djibouti, with all sorts of bottlenecks in port capacity as well as transportation links. Since coming to power, Abiy has signed a number of agreements with neighboring Somalia, Somaliland, Kenya and Sudan to diversify port access for the export-based industrial economy Ethiopia hopes to one day become. Eritrea’s ports of Massawa and Assab are well placed to be the gateway for Ethiopia’s future exports. Ethiopia has also asked that the U.N. sanctions it helped put in place against Eritrea for its alleged support of the Somali Islamist movement be lifted. During the beginning of his term, Isaias was seen as an inspirational figure in Africa, shunning the cult of personality common elsewhere on the continent. He was named by President Bill Clinton during his 1998 African tour as one of the leaders of the African renaissance. In the wake of the war with Ethiopia and following criticism of his handling of it, however, Isaias purged many of the top figures in the ruling party, shut down the press and suspended many of the democratic provisions in the constitution. Reporters Without Borders routinely ranks the press freedom there as worst in the world, below North Korea. A 2015 U.N. report said “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed in Eritrea” and that “some of these violations may constitute crimes against humanity.” paul.schemm@washpost.com	783	"[{""start"": 240, ""end"": 498, ""text"": ""After a two-year war and an 18-year standoff, the two countries have suddenly agreed to restore diplomatic ties, end the state of war and reestablish long-severed transportation links in the wake of overtures last month by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1031, ""end"": 1255, ""text"": ""The two leaders signed a five-point peace agreement on Monday, and now roads will be reopened, telephone connections have been restored, and, on Wednesday, Ethiopian Airlines will have its first flight to Asmara in 20 years."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2273, ""end"": 2482, ""text"": ""The breakthrough in relations appeared to come when Abiy on June 5 agreed to implement the 2002 arbitration agreement that ended the war and awarded key border territories to Eritrea such as the town of Badme."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3999, ""end"": 4230, ""text"": ""A normalization between the two countries will be a major boon for both, especially in cross-border trade.
