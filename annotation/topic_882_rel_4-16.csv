"Three weeks ago, 130 scientists, entrepreneurs and policy leaders held an invitation-only, closed-door meeting at Harvard University to discuss an ambitious plan to create synthetic human genomes. Now, after a flurry of criticism over the secrecy of the effort, the participants have published their idea, declaring that they're launching a project to radically reduce the cost of synthesizing genomes -- a potentially revolutionary development in biotechnology that could enable technicians to grow human organs for transplantation. The announcement, published Thursday in the journal Science, is the latest sign that biotechnology is going through a rapidly advancing but ethically fraught period. Scientists have been honing their techniques for manipulating the complex molecules that serve as the code for all life on the planet, and this same issue of the journal Science reports a breakthrough in editing RNA, a molecule that is the close cousin of DNA. The promoters of synthetic genomes envision a project that would eventually be on the same scale as the Human Genome Project of the 1990s, which led to the sequencing of the first human genomes. The difference this time would be that, instead of “reading” genetic codes, which is what sequencing does, the scientists would be “writing” them. They have dubbed this the “Genome Project-write.” ""[T]he goal of HGP-write is to reduce the costs of engineering and testing large genomes, including a human genome, in cell lines, more than 1,000-fold within ten years, while developing new technologies and an ethical framework for genome-scale engineering as well as transformative medical applications,"" the group wrote in a draft of a news release obtained by The Post. The project will be administered by a non-profit organization called the Center of Excellence for Engineering Biology, the news release said. The plan drew a negative response from the head of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, who had led the earlier Human Genome Project. In a statement released by NIH, Collins said it was premature to launch such an initiative. “NIH has not considered the time to be right for funding a large-scale production-oriented ‘HGP-write’ effort, as is framed in the Science article,” Collins said. He added, ""There are only limited ethical concerns about synthesizing segments of DNA for laboratory experiments.  But whole-genome, whole-organism synthesis projects extend far beyond current scientific capabilities, and immediately raise numerous ethical and philosophical red flags.” No one is talking about creating human beings from scratch. One application of cheaper genome synthesis, according to geneticist George Church, one of the authors of the Science article, would be to create cells that are resistant to viruses. These would not be cells used directly in human therapies, but rather in cell lines grown by the pharmaceutical industry for developing drugs. Such processes are vulnerable now to viral contamination. “If you’re manufacturing human therapeutics in mammalian cells, and you get contamination, it can blow you away for two years, which has actually happened,"" Church said. The Science paper gives a number of examples of what could emerge from cheaper synthesized genomes: ""growing transplantable human organs; engineering immunity to viruses in cell lines via genome-wide recoding; engineering cancer resistance into new therapeutic cell lines; and accelerating high-productivity, cost-efficient vaccine and pharmaceutical development using human cells and organoids."" The synthetic genome plan emerged from two closed-door meetings, one in New York City last year, and the second on May 10 at Harvard. The latter drew criticism from researchers who objected to the closed-door nature of the event; organizers said they didn't want to publicize their idea in advance of the publication of the article in Science. They said they plan to put a video of the proceedings online. Drew Endy, an associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford, wrote on Twitter, ""If you need secrecy to discuss your proposed research (synthesizing a human genome), you are doing something wrong."" Endy and Laurie Zoloth, a professor of medical ethics and humanities at Northwestern University, published an essay in which they said that, although this technology has promising applications, ""it is easy to make up far stranger uses of human genome synthesis capacities."" Endy on Thursday renewed his criticism. He said the group is proceeding without approval of the broader scientific community or any independent ethical review, he said. “Do we wish to be operating in a world where people are capable of organizing themselves to make human genomes? Should we pause and reflect on that question before we launch into doing it?” Endy told The Post. ""They’re talking about making real the capacity to make the thing that defines humanity – the human genome.” He said the article published in Science does not address any ethical questions. The promoters of the project say they will handle the ethical questions that come up, but Endy said in an email that this appears to be ""a brazen attempt to preempt independent ethical review."" The project has four lead organizers: Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School; Jef Boeke, director of the Institute for Systems Genetics at the NYU Langone Medical Center; Andrew Hessel, a researcher with the publicly traded company Autodesk; and Nancy J. Kelley, formerly executive director of the New York Genome Center. The news release stated that Kelley will be the top executive for the project, and that Autodesk has committed $250,000 in funding for the planning efforts. The organizers hope to raise $100 million by the end of this year, with an eventual goal of devoting $3 billion to the effort. The authors of the Science article wrote that some portion of the money that would be raised for the project should be directed toward addressing the ethical, legal and social issues surrounding how new genetic engineering technologies will be used. Church, informed of Endy's latest comments, said nine of the participants in the Harvard meeting were experts on the ethical, legal and social implications of technology, and he said he expects many more will respond to the article in Science. ""Even when we identify something that we do not want, we need to think deeply about how to prevent it -- effective surveillance, deterrents and consequences,"" Church told The Post. Church, whose laboratory at Harvard Medical School is renowned for breakthroughs in genetic engineering, said that in a span of three to 10 years it should be possible to bring down the cost of synthesizing long stretches of DNA by a thousand-fold. That would mirror the huge declines in the cost of sequencing – that is, reading – human genomes. He said researchers are already synthesizing stretches of genetic code, but only in small pieces. The obstacle to widespread application and testing of synthetic genomes is the cost, he said. The field of genetic engineering has been dealing with ethical quandaries since the 1970s. In December, for example, scientists from the U.S., Europe and China met in Washington and agreed to put limits on the breakthrough gene-editing technique known as CRISPR, which has the potential to make heritable changes in a person's genome.

At the end of every year, Edge reaches out to the smartest people on the planet and asks them a single question in an attempt to find the ideas and concepts that are changing the world of science. This year’s two-part question was: “What do you consider the most interesting recent [scientific] news? What makes it important?” Not surprisingly, this year’s set of 197 responses converged around a few key themes – the human brain, the human genome, space exploration and artificial intelligence. Based on these responses, here are 10 of the edgiest innovation buzzwords that have the greatest potential to change the trajectory of innovation in 2016. 1. The wisdom race Given all the apocalyptic scenarios we’ve been hearing about artificial intelligence over the past year, it’s not surprising that there’s been a lot of thinking about how to prevent one of those scenarios from actually occurring. Max Tegmark — the MIT physicist and cosmologist who has used mathematics to explore whether humanity might be living inside the equivalent of a Matrix-style computer simulation — calls this the “wisdom race.” What he has in mind here is a counterpart to the AI arms race, a “race between the growing power of technology and the growing wisdom with which we manage it.” With the introduction of most new technologies, humans are reactive rather than proactive, says Tegmark. Think of how the invention of fire led to fire alarms and fire extinguishers, or the invention of the automobile led to seat belts and air bags. What’s needed with AI is a more proactive approach so that we aren’t forced to learn from our mistakes later. “Either win the wisdom race and enable life to flourish for billions of years,” says Tegmark, “Or lose the race and go extinct.” 2. Reusable rockets At the end of 2015, both SpaceX and Blue Origin demonstrated the ability to return rockets safely to earth after use. That could be big for the future of space exploration, opening up a New Space Age fueled by cheaper costs and reusable rockets. As science historian George Dyson points out, “The launch business has been crippled, so far, by a vicious circle that has limited the market to expensive payloads — astronauts, military satellites, communication satellites, and deep space probes—consigned by customers who can afford to throw the launch vehicle away after a single use.” From this perspective, says Dyson, “Reusable rockets are the best hope of breaking this cycle and moving forward on a path leading to low-cost, high-duty-cycle launch systems where the vehicle carries inert propellant, and the energy source remains on the ground.” 3. Blockchain technology If you thought blockchain technology was only for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, you’d be wrong. As Melanie Swan of the New School for Social Research suggests, we’re on the cusp of a new “Crypto Enlightenment” driven by blockchain technology. It’s an entirely new paradigm driven by value rather than information: “Blockchain technology (the secure distributed ledger software that underlies cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin) connotes the Internet II: the transfer of value, as a clear successor position to the Internet I: the transfer of information.” The implementation of blockchain technology across financial assets such as currencies or mortgages is just the beginning, says Swan, “This means that all human interaction regarding the transfer of value, including money, property, assets, obligations, and contracts could be instantiated in blockchains for quicker, easier, less costly, less risky, and more auditable execution.” Blockchain technology, says Swan, could even lead to new models for governance, given its focus on distributed consensus. In fact, investor Marc Andreessen thinks the blockchain could be the biggest invention since the Internet itself. 4. Optogenetics Optogenetics is a relatively new field of biotechnology that gives researchers the ability to transform brain activity into light and light into brain activity. Optogenetics made headlines at the end of 2015, when Karl Deisseroth and Edward Boyden won a $3 million Breakthrough Prize in the life sciences for their pioneering work in the field. Using optogenetics, suggests Christian Keysers, a Dutch neuroscientist, it could be possible to use light to trigger feelings or emotions, to change what’s happening inside the brain, to treat depression, or perhaps even to wipe out or implant memories in others (along the lines of Total Recall). The potential for optogenetics is just now being understood: “Being able to record and manipulate brain activity will change who we are. It will serve as an interface through which computers can become part of our brain, and through which our brains could directly interface with each other.” 5. Neuroprediction Neuroprediction, which is the use of human brain imaging data to predict how a person will feel or behave in the future, almost sounds like something straight out of Minority Report. Thought crimes, anybody? If you accept the fact that human thoughts and choices are based on underlying biological processes, though, it might be possible to predict future behaviors by being able to measure and monitor those processes. In some cases, says Abigail Marsh, an associate professor at Georgetown University, neuroprediction could be used in the criminal justice system to handle problems of sentencing and probation. One study cited by Marsh found that predictions about whether paroled offenders would commit another crime were improved using a brain scan that measured brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. It’s still too early to use neuroprediction as a tool, but at some point, it might eventually lead to substantial gains for society, in the form of less crime and fewer resources spent on needless detentions. 6. Synthetic learning The real breakthrough in AI, says Kevin Kelly of Wired, is not in teaching machines how to become more intelligent – it’s in teaching them how to learn. He illustrates that concept with the example of the AI company DeepMind, which recently taught machines how to learn to play 49 simple video games. There’s a very important distinction, says Kelly, between teaching machines “how to play video games” and “how to learn to play video games.” In the latter case, you’re actually giving the computer the ability to learn in an unsupervised environment, building up rules from scratch. “Once learning can be synthesized it can be distributed into all kinds of ordinary devices and functions,” says Kelly. “It can be used to enable self-driving cars get better, or for medical diagnosing programs to improve with use.” In the future, “smart” objects will become even smarter. “Now that we know how to synthesize learning, we’ll expect all things to automatically improve as they are used, just as DeepMind’s game learner did.” 7. De-extinction The possibility of one day cloning a wooly mammoth, once only a science fiction dream along the lines of Jurassic Park, could become a reality thanks to rapid advances in genetic engineering. By extracting Paleo-DNA (the degraded DNA recovered from bones or hair of extinct species) and then amplifying and sequencing this DNA, says W. Tecumseh Fitch of the University of Vienna, it might be possible to engineer living organisms bearing genes recovered from extinct species. Think passenger pigeons at first; however, as the technology improves, we might even be talking about extinct hominids like Neanderthals. 8. Gene drive Imagine eradicating certain diseases such as malaria and dengue forever by eliminating the mosquitoes that carry them. Imagine altering the genetic composition of invasive species that cause specific diseases so that they can no longer carry these diseases. That’s the power of a new biotech tool called gene drive, which enables humans to forever change the genetic makeup of a wild population with the help of gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR. Basically, you force a gene to “drive” through a population, even if that gene is harmful to that population. It’s Darwin in reverse. “Gene drive is not a new kind of power,” explains Stewart Brand, “But it is a new level of power. And a new level of responsibility.” While gene drive has been proven to work in yeast, fruit flies and mice, there are a whole host of ecological and ethical issues to confront once you start playing God with the surrounding environment. At the very least, you’d better have an “undo” capability around in case you’ve picked the wrong gene and need to countermand your genetic order. 9. Kinematic fingerprints If 2016 is the year that virtual reality tips into the consumer mainstream, then it could also be the year that we hear about “kinematic fingerprints” — all the experiences and interactions that we leave behind when entering these virtual worlds. Thomas Metzinger, a fellow at Gutenberg Research College, predicts a future in which we will toggle effortlessly between the worlds of virtual reality, augmented reality and substitutional reality using an assortment of devices — the Microsoft HoloLens, the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive or the Samsung Gear VR. But what happens to our selves when we’re in these worlds? Given the current debate over the “right to be forgotten” and the use of data on the Internet, it’s easy to see how similar types of debates will occur once more people delve into the world of virtual reality. Who owns your consciousness or experiences in these virtual worlds? “Kinematic fingerprints generated by motion capture systems or avatar ownership and individuation will become important questions for regulatory agencies to consider,” says Metzinger. 10. Designer humans The ultimate use of new gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR will be the creation of “designer humans” with traits made to order, says Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at Britain’s Reading University. “Just imagine, no more Huntington’s, chorea, no more sickle-cell anemia, no more cystic fibrosis, or a raft of other heritable disorders,” says Pagel. “But what about desirable traits — eye and hair color, personality and temperament, and even intelligence?” That’s where things get interesting, since traits such as eye and hair color are theoretically within the reach of today’s CRISPR gene-editing technology. As a result, Pagel suggests, the current moratorium on using CRISPR technologies in humans “won’t last long.” Once our moral repulsion at the idea dissipates, change could come faster than anyone thinks: “The first truly and thoroughly designed humans are more than just the subjects of science fiction: they are on our doorsteps, waiting to be allowed in.” *** While those are some of the edgiest innovation concepts of 2016, it’s clear that there’s a lot percolating in nearly every field of scientific endeavor. This year, there were also thought-provoking responses on Edge.org ruminating on the future of crime, the changing dynamics of religion, the growing inequality of wealth and income on a global scale, the future of cities, and even the future of the human race itself.	444	"[{""start"": 3830, ""end"": 4005, ""text"": "".

In a distant part of the galaxy, 300 years in the future, Starship Enterprise Captain James T. Kirk talks to his crew via a communicator; has his medical officer assess medical conditions through a handheld device called a tricorder; synthesizes food and physical goods using his replicator; and travels short distances via a transporter. Kirk’s successors hold meetings in virtual-reality chambers, called holodecks, and operate alien spacecraft using displays mounted on their foreheads. All this takes place in the TV series Star Trek, and is of course science fiction. This science fiction is, however, becoming science reality. Many of the technologies that we saw in Star Trek are beginning to materialize, and ours may actually be better than Starfleet’s. Best of all, we won’t have to wait 300 years. Take Captain Kirk’s communicator. It was surely an inspiration for the first generation of flip phones, those clunky mobile devices that we used in the 1990s. These have evolved into smartphones, far more advanced than the science-fiction communicator. Kirk’s device didn’t receive e-mail, play music, surf the Web, provide directions, or take photos, after all. It also didn’t sweet-talk him as Apple’s Siri does when you ask her the right questions. Soon, our smartphones will also add the medical-assessment features of a tricorder, and it won’t need to be a separate device. Apple recently announced that iOS 8 will provide a platform for medical-sensor data that will be displayed by an app called Health. Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and others are all racing to build their own platforms and medical devices. We will soon see a new generation of wearable devices such as bracelets, watches, and clothing that use external sensors to perform electrocardiograms and measure our temperature, blood oxygenation, and other vital signs. These will later be replaced by less obtrusive sensors in skin patches, tattoos and eventually microchips embedded in our bodies. As well, we will have cameras and heat, gas, and sound sensors in our bathrooms, kitchens, and living rooms that constantly monitor our health and lifestyle. What are making these health sensors possible are miniaturized mechanical and microelectromechanical (MEMS) elements made using microfabrication technology. Similar advances in microfluidics and nanofluidics are enabling development of labs on thumbnail-sized chips. Nanobiosym, for example is developing a device, called GENE-Radar, that can identify, within minutes, a range of illnesses, including AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer. Such devices will also be ubiquitous and immediately identify a broad range of disease markers. Unlike the Star Trek tricorder, which is used occasionally, they will constantly be monitoring our bodies. When you look at the advances that have already happened in 3D printing, you begin to realize that this is the making of the Star Trek replicator. 3D printers can create objects in plastic, metal, glass, titanium, human cells, and yes, even chocolate from a design. Today’s 3D printers are painfully slow, and it takes many hours to print a breadbox-sized object; but in a decade, they will become as common, fast, and inexpensive as our laser document printers. In about two decades, we will be 3D printing our dinner as well as our electronics. We already have Star Trek– and Jetsons-like video-chat capabilities. Rather than require the large, clunky monitors that we saw George Jetson and Captain Kathryn Janeway use, ours use free Facetime and Skype apps that run on smartphones and laptops. Holodeck-type video conferences have also been possible for several years. I spoke via hologram, in 2011, to a bunch of entrepreneurs in Uruguay using technology that a small company there, Holograam, had developed. Remember the holographic message from Princess Leia to Obi-Wan Kenobi, in Star Wars? That’s how my beamed image looked. Start-ups such as Oculus, which Facebook recently purchased, are developing virtual-reality goggles that simulate the real world. Others companies are developing three-dimensional projectors that beam images onto screens that make a person look as though physically present. These technologies are in their infancy, but watch them grow and add touch and smell capabilities. We will be meeting each other through virtual reality, and it will feel as if we are really there. The universal translator that Captain Kirk used to talk to alien species is also in development. Google Translate already does a great job of translating pages of text from one human language to another. And earlier this year, Microsoft demonstrated a real-time, voice-based, language interpreter that works on Skype. I don’t expect any progress on alien languages until we encounter some alien species, but a commercially available virtual real-time translator (a virtual interpreter) for human languages isn’t so far away. Scientists recently announced that they had made breakthroughs in quantum teleportation. They were able to show a promise of quantum information transmission — showing the duplication in the spin state of an electron between one place and another, through quantum tunneling — without transmitting matter or energy through the space intervening. This led to hopes that we might one day see a Star Trek-like transporter that can beam our atoms from one place to another. I am not waiting for this one, however, as there is no way that I will willingly allow my atoms to be disintegrated in one location and reassembled in another. I would worry about a software bug or a hardware crash. We saw these too in Star Trek. I’ll just stick to the self-driving cars that will become commercially available by the end of this decade. The most exciting Star Trek marvel of all — the Starship Enterprise — may also be on its way. In discussion at Fox Studios in March 2012, Elon Musk told me that he planned to retire on Mars. He said he was inspired by Star Trek and planned to build a spacecraft like the Starship Enterprise to take him there. I really thought he was joking — or had had too much to drink. But after that, his company Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, successfully docked a spacecraft it had built, called the Dragon, with the International Space Station and returned with cargo. On Dec. 3, 2013, SpaceX launched a commercial geostationary satellite using Falcon rockets. SpaceX says it is planning a Dragon/Falcon 9 flight in 2015, which will have a fully certified, human-rated, escape system useable during launch. I’ll bet that Musk does develop a version 1 of the Enterprise. And he may well be our first real-life Captain Kirk.	443	"[{""start"": 633, ""end"": 762, ""text"": ""Many of the technologies that we saw in Star Trek are beginning to materialize, and ours may actually be better than Starfleet’s."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1261, ""end"": 1386, ""text"": ""Soon, our smartphones will also add the medical-assessment features of a tricorder, and it won’t need to be a separate device"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1388, ""end"": 1518, ""text"": ""Apple recently announced that iOS 8 will provide a platform for medical-sensor data that will be displayed by an app called Health"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1520, ""end"": 1844, ""text"": ""oogle, Microsoft, Samsung, and others are all racing to build their own platforms and medical devices.

"On Monday, Britain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority greenlighted experiments that will attempt to edit the genes of human embryos. The work, which will be the world's first officially approved use of public funding for human-genome editing, is to be led by The Francis Crick Institute's Kathy Niakan. The news comes less than a year after the first reports of human-gene editing — published by Chinese scientists in the journal Protein and Cell — using the fantastic and at times troubling technology known as CRISPR. By harnessing an ancient defense mechanism built into bacteria, CRISPR allows scientists to target, delete and replace specific genes. It has been used extensively in other organisms, but research in humans has been slow. The Chinese experiments reported last year were largely unsuccessful. Few of the embryos in the experiment were successfully modified, and even fewer had the changes that scientists intended to make. None of the embryos were gestated, and the authors of the study readily admitted that their error rate was too high for use on viable embryos. But these scientists and others have continued working at the problem in the hopes of one day eliminating certain human illnesses. In the meantime, policymakers are beginning to chip away at the mountain of ethical quandaries that will certainly result from such a technology. But Britain now has become the first country to approve the use of public funding for such research. In the United States, labs have to find private funding for any research that creates or destroys human embryos, and some lawmakers seek to ban it altogether. Even in China, where the first ""successful"" editing occurred, the guidelines are murky. ""China has guidelines, but it is often unclear exactly what they are until you've done it and stepped over an unclear boundary,"" Robin Lovell-Badge of the Francis Crick Institute told the BBC. ""This is the first time it has gone through a properly regulatory system and been approved."" Niakan's approval only allows the study of embryos for 14 days at a time, and her lab will not attempt to implant the modified embryos into women. They hope to study the genetic changes that occur during the earliest stages of life, which could help improve in vitro fertilization techniques and prevent early miscarriages. The research will use donated embryos left over from IVF treatments, and will follow them only through the point in their development when they have about 250 cells. ""Many of the women who make this donation have experienced being unable to have a child without artificial reproductive technology and make their donation altruistically with the hope of allowing others to benefit from improvements in knowledge and treatments,"" Alastair Kent, director of Genetic Alliance UK, said in a statement. Kent, who is not involved in the newly approved research, oversees 180 charities devoted to supporting people with genetic conditions. ""We should acknowledge the contribution that embryo donors make to allow this research to happen,"" Kent said. The University of Kent's Darren Griffin called the ruling ""a triumph for common sense"" in a statement, and Sarah Norcross, director of Progress Educational Trust, lauded the decision as ""a victory for level-headed regulation over moral panic."" Niakan doesn't intend to make any edits that would create ""designer babies"" — embryos tailored to be free of disease or to posses desirable physical traits. But the work will help improve the use of CRISPR on the human genome, possibly making it easier for other researchers to use the technique to this end. Many argue that all research in this area can be considered a slippery slope toward modified, living humans.

Last year I predicted that social media would lose its sizzle. Since then, the bubble has burst for companies such as Facebook, Zynga and Groupon. The tablet computer market, on the other hand, is booming, voice recognition is becoming a standard feature in new computing devices, and there have been, as I alluded to in 2012, notable cloud-computing failures and security breaches in the past year. I am glad to have been wrong about LinkedIn. It is a great company with a stellar management team. Also, tablet prices haven’t quite hit the $100 mark in the U.S., as I predicted they would. But I still anticipate they will, and likely very soon. So, what else lies ahead for 2013? There is nothing as spectacular as the Facebook IPO, at least at this point, but expect gradual technology progressions of greater significance than have been seen in years past. The Post’s Hayley Tsukayama has outlined the trends in tech for the coming year — a year I believe will be one of transition for the sector. This year, expect tech innovators to set the stage to solve global problems, since technologies in fields such as medicine, robotics, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, 3D printing, and nanomaterials are advancing exponentially. Like the processors in our computers, they are becoming increasingly powerful while their price drops precipitously. This will enable startups to take on problems in fields such as energy, health, education, and security that only government and big research labs previously could. Most recently, the big rewards have gone to startups developing relatively simple social media platforms and applications. In the upcoming era of exponential technologies, expect the rewards to go to players that solve big, global problems. Here are the big innovation trends that I believe will gain traction in 2013. Tablet explosion to computing revolution The entry price of tablet computers will almost surely drop to under $100 in 2013 — especially if the rumored $99 Acer tablet gains traction this year, as I believe it will, or if the India Aakash tablet finally lives up to its potential. I also anticipate that the tablet price tag will keep dropping until it reaches close to zero over a 2-to-3 year period. We will reach the point where it makes sense for companies to give tablets away just as mobile carriers give phones away in exchange for plan subscriptions. More broadly, we can expect to see tablet computers almost everywhere in this decade—our kitchens, bathrooms, cars, supermarkets, schools and elevators. Apple currently owns the high end of the market, of course, and I don’t expect cheap tablets to put any dent in the company’s sales this year. But, if Apple fails to keep innovating, the company will surely feel the pain in 2014 and beyond as Samsung continues to nip at its heels. The PC laptop vendors — Dell, HP and Lenovo, among others — should worry since tablets will continue to cannibalize their higher-priced products. The biggest winner in this revolution will likely be Google, with its free Android operating system. Unsurprisingly, the loser will probably be Microsoft, which licenses its mobile operating system, Windows RT, for around $80 — more than the hardware will eventually cost. In the long term, expect the billions of new users that come online over the next few years to be doing Google searches and using Google’s applications. The “quantified self” goes mainstream and creates a new regulatory battlefield We saw a trickle of sensor-based medical devices in 2012, but these were just the start of the “quantified self” movement. As sensors become smaller, more powerful, and cheaper, we will see many new types of devices that help us monitor our health. These will be embedded in our iPhone cases, bathroom scales, toothbrushes, and even in our jewelry. In 2013, expect to be able to purchase sophisticated new devices like the AliveCor Heart Monitor, which I have been testing and the FDA has approved for use by licensed U.S. medical professionals. If I had a device like this 10 years ago, I may have been able to avoid the heart attack that I had. The device will cost $199 when prescribed by a physician. Today, we need physicians to analyze the data the device provides. But, given the rate at which technology is advancing, computers may be able to do a better job. Witness the way IBM’s Watson defeated Jeopardy champions. It had far more data available to it. Eventually, I foresee cloud-based systems that have access to the latest medical knowledge and to data from hundreds of millions of people analyzing medical data. I would trust these systems more than I trust my cardiologist, and the app to access these will be available anytime and as often as I need it.  Even before we reach this stage, consumers should be allowed to purchase these devices off the shelf to see and analyze their own medical data. This is where the battle lines will increasingly be drawn between technologists and regulators. Users will begin to demand greater control of their own data and more ways to monitor it in order to improve their lives. That means, in the coming year, one should expect to see the regulatory battles over these types of technologies become more frequent and heated. Manufacturing jobs continue to return to the U.S. Expect advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and 3D printing to, as I have previously written, change the economics of manufacturing, lead to a renaissance in design and creativity, and bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. over the next year. Manufacturing is also destined to become a technology industry. The jobs of the future will be in creating 3D designs and maintaining and operating sophisticated computer machinery. In 2013, expect to see the commercial availability of a new generation of robots like Baxter from Rethink Robotics and the grape-picking Wall-Ye. From big baloney to big opportunity in big data Big data was one of the most hyped concepts in the tech industry in 2012 and some are feeling let down. But there is no reason to lose hope—we are just getting started. The amount of data we are creating is increasing exponentially. That data is coming from sources such as cameras, sensors signals, social media, Web browsing trails and Google searches, e-commerce transactions, medical records, and DNA decoding. I expect that in 2013 we will see more success stories like that of Nate Silver, who was able to use big data to out-predict the pollsters. In subsequent years, we will see billion-dollar startups emerge — companies that have mastered the art of using machine-intelligence to harness big data. Google Now, which was named Innovation of the Year by Popular Science, shows what is possible when you combine disparate pieces of information. Google claims it “tells you today’s weather before you start your day, how much traffic to expect before you leave for work, when the next train will arrive as you’re standing on the platform, or your favorite team’s score while they’re playing.” Within a few years, expect to be able to do Google-like searches to learn what diseases those with similar genetics have had and what medications worked for them. Eventually, when researchers combine the medical records of a hundred million people with their genome data, work habits, and other information, such as weather and pollution data based on where they live, they will all but certainly be able to determine the correlation between genome, disease and lifestyle. New user interface paradigms I couldn’t agree more with Tsukayama on this topic. Expect the computer keyboard and mouse to become obsolete. The most promising product on the horizon is the Leap Motion controller, which senses hand and finger movements, allowing users to do sophisticated gestures similar to those in the 2002 film Minority Report. There was some buzz about the device in 2012, but this year it is expected to retail for $69. I expect similar technologies to be embedded in many computing devices. These advances in voice and gesture recognition mean we will soon have a more natural way of using computers. When Google releases Project Glass—eyeglasses that display words and pictures — in the coming years, I predict we won’t even need the computer screens at all. Don’t be surprised if 2013 is a a dull year for Silicon Valley bloggers looking for the next social media startup and a really exciting year for humanity. Washington Post Co.

For scientist Jack Newman, creating a new life-form has become as simple as this: He types out a DNA sequence on his laptop. Clicks “send.” And a few yards away in the laboratory, robotic arms mix together some compounds to produce the desired cells. Newman’s biotech company is creating new organisms, most forms of genetically modified yeast, at the dizzying rate of more than 1,500 a day. Some convert sugar into medicines. Others create moisturizers that can be used in cosmetics. And still others make biofuel, a renewable energy source usually made from corn. “You can now build a cell the same way you might build an app for your iPhone,” said Newman, chief science officer of Amyris. Some believe this kind of work marks the beginning of a third industrial revolution — one based on using living systems as “bio-factories” for creating substances that are either too tricky or too expensive to grow in nature or to make with petrochemicals. The rush to biological means of production promises to revolutionize the chemical industry and transform the economy, but it also raises questions about environmental safety and biosecurity and revives ethical debates about “playing God.” Hundreds of products are in the pipeline. Laboratory-grown artemisinin, a key anti-malarial drug, went on sale in April with the potential to help stabilize supply issues. A vanilla flavoring that promises to be significantly cheaper than the costly extract made from beans grown in rain forests is scheduled to hit the markets in 2014. On Wednesday, Amyris announced another milestone — a memorandum of understanding with Brazil’s largest low-cost airline, GOL Linhas Aereas, to begin using a jet fuel produced by yeast starting in 2014. Proponents characterize bio-factories as examples of “green technology” that are sustainable and immune to fickle weather and disease. Backers say they will reshape how we use land globally, reducing the cultivation of cash crops in places where that practice hurts the environment, break our dependence on pesticides and result in the closure of countless industrial factories that pollute the air and water. But some environmental groups are skeptical. They compare the spread of bio-factories to the large-scale burning of coal at the turn of the 20th century — a development with implications for carbon dioxide emissions and global warming that weren’t understood until decades later. Much of the early hype surrounding this technology was about biofuels — the dream of engineering colonies of yeast that could produce enough fuel to power whole cities. It turned out that the technical hurdles were easier to overcome than the economic ones. Companies haven’t been able to find a way to produce enough of it to make the price affordable, and so far the biofuels have been used only in smaller projects, such as local buses and Amyris’s experiment with GOL’s planes. But dozens of other products are close to market, including synthetic versions of fragrances extracted from grass, coconut oil and saffron powder, as well as a gas used to make car tires. Other applications are being studied in the laboratory: biosensors that light up when a parasite is detected in water; goats with spider genes that produce super-strength silk in their milk; and synthetic bacteria that decompose trash and break down oil spills and other contaminated waste at a rapid pace. Revenue from industrial chemicals made through synthetic biology is already as high as $1.5 billion, and it will increase at an annual rate of 15 to 25 percent for the next few years, according to an estimate by Mark Bünger, an analyst for Lux Research, a Boston-based advisory firm that focuses on emerging technologies. Reengineering yeast Since it was founded a decade ago, Amyris has become a legend in the field that sits at the intersection of biology and engineering, creating more than 3 million organisms. Unlike traditional genetic engineering, which typically involves swapping a few genes, the scientists are building entire genomes from scratch. Keeping bar-code-stamped vials in giant refrigerators at minus-80 degrees, the company’s repository in Emeryville, Calif., is one of the world’s largest collections of living organisms that do not exist in nature. Ten years ago, when Newman was a postdoctoral student at the University of California at Berkeley, the idea of being able to program cells on a computer was fanciful. Newman was working in a chemical engineering lab run by biotech pioneer Jay Keasling and helping conduct research on how to rewrite the metabolic pathways of microorganisms to produce useful substances. Their first target was yeast. The product of millions of years of evolution, the single-celled organism was capable of a miraculous feat: When fed sugar, it produced energy and excreted alcohol and carbon dioxide. Humans have harnessed this power for centuries to make wine, beer, cheese and other products. Could they tinker with some genes in the yeast to create a biological machine capable of producing medicine? Excited about the idea of trying to apply the technology to a commercial product, Keasling, Newman and two other young post-docs — Keith Kinkead Reiling and Neil Renninger — started Amyris in 2003 and set their sights on artemisinin, an ancient herbal remedy found to be more than 90 percent effective at curing those infected with malaria. It is harvested from the leaves of the sweet wormwood plant, but the supply of the plant had sometimes fluctuated in the past, causing shortages. The new company lined up high-profile investors: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which gave $42.6 million to a nonprofit organization to help finance the research, and Silicon Valley luminaries John Doerr and Vinod Khosla, who as part of a group invested $20 million. As of this month, Amyris said its partner, pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, has manufactured 35 tons of artemisinin — roughly equivalent to 70 million courses of treatment. The World Health Organization gave its stamp of approval to the drug in May, and the pills are being used widely. Concerns about risks The early scientific breakthroughs by the Amyris founders paved the way for dozens of other companies to do similar work. The next major product to be released is likely to be a vanilla flavoring by Evolva, a Swiss company that has laboratories in the San Francisco Bay area. Cultivated in the remote forests of Madagascar, Mexico and the West Indies, natural vanilla is one of the world’s most revered spices. But companies that depend on the ingredient to flavor their products have long struggled with its scarcity and the volatility of its price. Its chemically synthesized cousins, which are made from petrochemicals and paper pulp waste and are three to five times cheaper, have 99 percent of the vanilla market but have failed to match the natural version’s complexity. Now scientists in a lab in Denmark believe they’ve created a type of vanilla flavoring produced by yeast that they say will be more satisfying to the palate and cheaper at the same time. In Evolva’s case, much of the controversy has focused on whether the flavoring can be considered “natural.” Evolva boasts that it is, because only the substance used to produce the flavoring was genetically modified — not what people actually consume. “From my point of view it’s fundamentally as natural as beer or bread,” said Evolva chief executive Neil Goldsmith, who is a co-founder of the company. “Neither brewer’s or baker’s yeast is identical to yeast in the wild. I’m comfortable that if beer is natural, then this is natural.” That justification has caused an uproar among some consumer protection and environmental groups. They say that representing Evolva’s laboratory-grown flavoring as something similar to vanilla extract from an orchid plant is deceptive, and they have mounted a global campaign urging food companies to boycott the “vanilla grown in a petri dish.” “Any ice-cream company that calls this all-natural vanilla would be committing fraud,” argues Jaydee Hanson, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit public interest group based in Washington. Jim Thomas, a researcher for the ETC Group, said there is a larger issue that applies to all organisms produced by synthetic biology techniques: What if they are accidentally released and evolve to have harmful characteristics? “There is no regulatory structure or even protocols for assessing the safety of synthetic organisms in the environment,” Thomas said. Then there’s the potential economic impact. What about the hundreds of thousands of small farmers who produce these crops now? Artemisinin is farmed by an estimated 100,000 people in Kenya, Tanzania, Vietnam and China and the vanilla plant by 200,000 in Madagascar, Mexico and beyond. Evolva officials say they believe there will still be a strong market for artisan ingredients like vanilla from real beans and that history has shown that these products typically attract an even higher premium when new products hit the market. Other biotech executives say they are sympathetic, but that it is the price of progress. Amyris’s Newman says he is confused by environmental groups’ criticism and points to the final chapter of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” — the seminal book that is credited with launching the environmental movement. In it, Carson mentions ways that science can solve the environmental hazards we have endured through years of use of fossil fuels and petrochemicals. “The question you have to ask yourself is, ‘Is the status quo enough?’ ” Newman said. “We live in a world where things can be improved upon.” More news about the intersection of biology and engineering: Glowing plant project on Kickstarter sparks regulatory debate Editorial: Biology is experiencing a period of innovation and discovery that owes much to the power of computation Environmental groups call for tigher regulation of ‘extreme genetic engineering’	440	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 390, ""text"": ""entist Jack Newman, creating a new life-form has become as simple as this: He types out a DNA sequence on his laptop.

Two hundred years ago, Edward Jenner inoculated an 8-year-old with cowpox, and the world’s first “vaccine” was born. We all know how the story ends. Vaccines gave way to one of the greatest achievements in human health: the eradication of smallpox. But Jenner’s work never received praise during his lifetime and instead met with harsh skepticism. Many doctors refrained to use the word “vaccination” when inoculating people for fear that the patient would refuse the treatment. That’s the way science goes — there’s always an aversion to new technology. Today, researchers are preparing for public resistance to a project that could revolutionize the field of genetic engineering. A few years ago, a team of scientists led by professors Austin Burt and Andrea Chrisanti at Imperial College London published a study detailing the steps needed to eradicate malaria through genetic modification. [Scientists create a mutant mosquito that could help eradicate malaria] At the time, the team was studying swarms of mosquitoes locked in small cube-shaped cages, engineered to glow in the dark with the help of fluorescent proteins. They then made a special mosquito with a gene that could break up that fluorescence and engineered it so that its genes would pass on to its offspring more aggressively than those of its mate. The result? After a few generations, the cages got dimmer and dimmer. The fluorescence gene was eventually knocked out of the population. It’s a form of what’s called a “gene drive,” isolating a gene and making it “selfish” to appear more frequently. Its success led to a tantalizing conclusion: If geneticists could isolate single traits in the genome of a single mosquito and engineer them, they could theoretically control the genes of the entire mosquito population. Today, scientists are already designing mosquitoes that aren’t able to carry malaria and other experts say we’re only 10 to 15 years away from releasing them into the wild. By that time, the deadliest animal on the planet could be rendered harmless. “It’s super exciting,” Burt said in an interview. “We’re doing a lot of good (to combat the disease), but the consensus seems to be that we’re not doing enough to eliminate malaria. There’s a desperate need for further intervention.” Malaria is only the beginning. Geneticists have suggested other types of gene drives that could be implemented to solve the world’s problems. If we can design mosquitoes, we could eliminate invasive pests like the python in Florida, strengthen species threatened by global warming and improve world hunger by growing more abundant crops. But the daydreaming is stunted by fears of unintended consequences and a disdain for “unnatural” human intervention. What happens if newly introduced genes end up having unexpected long-term effects on a species? Or on other species that it might cross-breed with? What are the chances of an unexpected mutation? Without proper caution, some scientists warn, gene drives could deliver ecological disaster. Without the right consideration, we could unleash monsters. [Killer robots? Superintelligence? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.] “I accept that people get worried,” Chrisanti said. “When scientists do something that’s very revolutionary, it’s normal that it generates a lot of fear.” One group of scientists published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this summer, suggesting that if we engineer invasive species to die off, there’s a distinct possibility of those faulty genes entering native groups of that species. Instead of preserving the natural populations of the a specific region, they argue, we may end up accidentally eliminating a species worldwide. Advocates of the technology say, just as we are able to introduce new genes into a system, so too can we add “recall” genes to correct a population if anything gets out of hand. Others remind us that we are years away from actually implementing the technology on a large scale. Science, they argue, happens incrementally and in regulated steps that mitigate risk. Engineered mosquito populations, for example, would require computer modeling, baseline studies in a lab, more baseline studies in the field — as well as strict adherence to environmental laws on the release of modified insects. Scientists will continue to work out the kinks of the technology — there’s too much potential for it to fall by the wayside due to potential problems. Risks like these are at the heart of questions that scientists at the National Academy of the Sciences are carefully parsing out in workshops. The NAS, which invited scientists from around the world, is just gathering information at this point — but this is the start of a broader discussion on the ethical considerations of gene drives, such as how gene drives should be regulated or how the technology could impact developing countries. But a common theme coming out of the discussions is that risks are only one head wind facing the technology. Another pressing problem lies in public perception. Genetic modification is, of course, nothing new. A good chunk of what we eat is already “genetically modified” in some way, although our ability to actually edit genomes has only emerged in past couple of years. It’s especially become easier thanks to CRISPR, a three-year-old method that allows scientists to splice out segments of a genome and insert new DNA. But the exciting news of genetics is often mixed in with headlines of so-called “designer babies” and of Chinese scientists genetically modifying human fetuses. For many, the idea of playing with the chemical identity of living beings, even non-human, poses ethical concerns: Are scientists playing God or risking the creation of a Frankenstein? Even genetically modified foods face heavy skepticism, although there’s sound consensus in the science community that they are safe. Just last week, the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of a genetically modified salmon, despite protests from critics who disapproved of the “Frankenfish.” Fears of the unnatural will certainly persist, but gene drive will change the conversation completely. That’s because there’s no “opt-out” feature in gene drive technology. People may have objections to genetically modified foods, but they don’t have to eat it. A few states even require companies to label the foods as GMOs to preserve that right. But to implement social policies based on gene-drive technology would require a broad moral consensus on genetic modification. We would have to collectively affirm that society accepts editing the DNA of mosquitoes because we agree to value human life over our desire for “natural” mosquitoes. And that extends to every form of gene drive. Do we value the preservation of native species over the preservation of natural genes? Do we value strengthening coral in the face of rising ocean acidity over the virtue of their original genetic identity? “At the end of the day, it becomes a political issue.” Chrisanti said. “Do people really want it?” We probably will eventually want gene drive, at least the versions that have potential to save lives and improve the economies of developing nations. In the long run, society tends to accept innovation that dramatically improves lives, regardless of the initial response. Despite recent spurts of “anti-vaxxer” news, for example, the resounding criticism of politicians who questioned — or even didn’t expressly support — vaccines verify that our society today is soundly in favor of the technology we once disdained. That’s not to say we should be cavalier about gene drive’s potential risks and rewards. We should have a vigorous debate about its potential consequences. We shouldn’t use the technology until it has been perfected and thoroughly tested, which means that we probably won’t be using it any time soon. But if, in the future, thousands of lives are saved and developing nations are vastly improved thanks to gene-drive interventions, will we view our aversion to modified organisms the same way we view the rejection of vaccines?

Humanity’s ability to alter nature, a characteristic of our species for thousands of years, has taken a big step forward. The ability to change the genetics of life to our liking was previously confined to domesticated creatures such as livestock and crops. It now extends throughout much of the biosphere, including ourselves. Genetic engineering on a planetary scale used to be the stuff of science-fiction dreams, and sometimes nightmares. But now the potential has arrived. For the first time, discussions about quickly transforming entire ecosystems are no longer hypothetical. Scientists from University of California at San Diego and the University of California at Irvine announced in November that they had genetically engineered a breed of mosquito that not only blocks infection by malaria parasites but also can quickly spread its antimalarial genes throughout its species. In some areas, a single season might be enough to change the population. Since malaria kills hundreds of thousands of people annually, the potential benefit is obvious. Other mosquito-borne diseases might be controlled in this fashion as well. And apart from fighting disease, there’s a vast potential to easily introduce desirable changes in other wild species. One could imagine disease-resistant cattle or algae that have been engineered to grow more prolifically as a source of biofuel or . . . the list is endless. Unintended havoc But worries about pitfalls and mistakes are also widespread. Lessons from previous ecological disruptions resonate in the minds of scientists and bioethicists. Unintended havoc is sometimes caused when people transplant a species into a non-native environment. Without natural predators, the invasive species can run wild and produce undesired effects. The spread of Africanized bees in North America, snakes in Guam and rabbits in Australia all provide examples of irreparable harm from introduced species. And for humans, there’s no lack of nightmare stories from science fiction about modifying people, whether genetically or through social conditioning. The scientists manipulating mosquito genes say they recognize the potential pitfalls and are keeping their work safeguarded in the laboratory. They’re asking other scientists, governments and nongovernmental organizations to discuss how and whether this technology should be used. In January, the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, Calif. — named for a genomics pioneer — will host a workshop involving these groups. That will be followed by many more meetings to develop rules and ethical guidelines that people have never needed before. Questions include: ● Where to use the technology? ● How to get consent of the local population? ● What could go wrong, and how to handle it? It appears likely that the technology will be evaluated in stages, said Robert Friedman, the Venter institute’s chief operating officer. After laboratory testing, contained field trials would be conducted to examine how the testing works in an outdoor setting. But this could be done only after the many questions about how to handle this technology are considered, and down the line, about how a regulator would approve such organisms. “The workshop itself will focus on insects, but not just insect-borne human diseases,” Friedman said. “It will also focus on potential agricultural applications of gene-drive technologies.” Humanity reached this point because, after decades of genetic engineering, scientists have devised a reliable method of pushing man-made genetic changes through wild populations. Called gene drive, this technology has been married to the powerful gene-editing technology called CRISPR-Cas9. In traditional breeding, genes from a relatively few modified creatures tend to get lost in the much larger population with unmodified genes. That’s why the reproduction of basset hounds, for example, must be strictly controlled to keep the breed distinct. Gene drive changes this equation by multiplying the number of modified genes with each generation. A modified gene inherited from, say, the father, actively spreads the alteration to the corresponding gene inherited from the mother. Under ideal conditions, the genes would nearly double in frequency with each generation. The concept has been around since at least 2003, but swiftly took flight after CRISPR technology became available about four years ago. With the impending arrival of this technology and the potential to use it outside the lab, genetic engineering experts led by George Church of Harvard Medical School wrote a cautionary commentary in the journal Science. The commentary warned of potential dangers and urged strict precautions. That was in April 2014. In March of this year, scientists led by UC San Diego’s Ethan Bier and Valentino Gantz reported, also in Science, that they had gotten a gene drive to work in fruit flies. They evocatively named the technology a “mutagenic chain reaction.” Chain reaction In the chain reaction, a mutation that’s heterozygous, or present in only one pair of genes, is converted into a homozygous mutation, which is present in both pairs. In the mosquito study, whose findings were published Nov. 23 by Bier, Gantz and UC Irvine researcher Anthony James, the efficiency of conversion was measured at 99.5 percent. This chain-reaction element introduces a new factor in genetic engineering, which itself was subject to a moratorium in the mid-’70s as scientists examined the risks and benefits. Scientists and policymakers came to a consensus that genetic engineering is a legitimate tool for developing better medicines. For example, the insulin used by diabetics is made in bacteria that have been given a gene that codes for making insulin. An entire class of drugs, monoclonal antibodies, is produced from genetically engineered cells in what is now a standard part of the pharmaceutical industry. Moving from genetically engineered drugs to genetically engineered foods has proved more controversial. Milk from cows given growth hormone made by genetic engineering has drawn opposition, although the Food and Drug Administration has said the milk is safe to drink. Opponents say introducing foods with man-made genes could have dangerous or unforeseen results. In Mexico, opposition has focused on preventing the use of genetically modified maize, which could hybridize with teosinte, corn’s wild ancestor. Teosinte provides genetic diversity lost in domesticated corn. This diversity includes traits for disease resistance that have been lost in the process of domestication. Scientific studies have found no harm to human health from genetic modification of foods. The potential benefits include greater productivity, resistance to disease and drought, and higher nutritional value. One such food, golden rice, has been genetically modified to produce more vitamin A. It’s intended to prevent or treat vitamin A deficiency, which affects 250 million preschool children and is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children, according to the World Health Organization. Transnational groups such as WHO and the United Nations have issued policy statements on genetically modified crops, pointing out potential problems as well as benefits. But they do not have regulatory power. Instead, their role is to provide research and tools to guide decision-making by sovereign states. It’s not clear what structure will be developed to deal with the proposed use of gene drive outside laboratories. That will presumably be a big part of the January workshop. Venter has long advocated improving on nature via genetically engineered life. He led a team that created the first life-form with a partly synthetic genome. Venter-founded companies include Synthetic Genomics, which is developing synthetic biology to develop products such as new vaccines and drugs, foods, biofuels and animal organs for human transplant. — San Diego Union-Tribune	438	"[{""start"": 583, ""end"": 884, ""text"": ""Scientists from University of California at San Diego and the University of California at Irvine announced in November that they had genetically engineered a breed of mosquito that not only blocks infection by malaria parasites but also can quickly spread its antimalarial genes throughout its species"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3305, ""end"": 3391, ""text"": ""It will also focus on potential agricultural applications of gene-drive technologies."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3392, ""end"": 3681, ""text"": ""Humanity reached this point because, after decades of genetic engineering, scientists have devised a reliable method of pushing man-made genetic changes through wild populations.

"It is premature to fight malaria, Zika, Lyme and other diseases with genetically engineered insects or other animals that have been designed to spread their modified genes in the wild, according to an expert panel convened by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. But the group, saying such a “gene drive” offers promise in combating diseases or saving endangered species, concluded that experimental research should continue, including carefully controlled field tests. The panel's report, released Wednesday, has no force of law but will likely be influential in the debate about how, when and whether to use gene-drive technology to suppress the spread of pathogens. It comes amid mounting concerns about the Zika virus, which can be spread by mosquitoes and is linked to a spike in birth defects in South America. The National Academies formed the group in response to the recent development of gene-drive techniques. The field of biotechnology is in the midst of a revolution, in part due to a new gene-editing tool known as CRISPR, which mimics a system invented by bacteria to defend themselves against viruses. With CRISPR, scientists can easily manipulate the genetic code of almost any organism.   An earlier National Academies report, released last month, gave what could be described as a nuanced endorsement of genetically engineered (GE) crops. This new report is a close cousin, focusing on a subset of GE animals, including disease-carrying insects, in which the modified genes are designed to spread like wildfire through nature and have the potential to reduce populations or even, in theory, to drive a species to extinction. It can also protect species that are assaulted by invasive pathogens. The new report has a more cautious tone than the crop study — more akin to a flashing red light (stop and proceed if all is clear) rather than a flashing yellow. The panel did not object to gene-drive technology in theory but said there are too many uncertainties in how it would play out. Its report states: ""There is insufficient evidence available at this time to support the release of gene-drive modified organisms into the environment. However, the potential of gene drives for basic and applied research are significant and justify proceeding with laboratory research and highly-controlled field trials."" The report said the accelerated pace of innovation in genetic engineering is both a positive and a negative. Gene-modified organisms could help eradicate vector-borne diseases and could help boost populations of endangered species (by targeting diseases that are driving down their numbers). But society should resist the temptation to deploy gene-drive organisms in a crisis, the report states: ""The presumed efficiency of gene-drive modified organisms may lead to calls for their release in perceived crisis situations before there is adequate knowledge of ecological effects, and before mitigation plans for unintended harmful consequences are in place."" That's a recurring theme in the 202-page report: This is a new science with a lot of unknowns. It also has ""many, many promising features,"" said James Collins, co-chair of the panel and a professor of natural history at Arizona State University. But he raised the possibility that a gene-drive effort targeting a pathogen carried by one species might ultimately fail if the pathogen adapted and became endemic in a different species. And there might be other anticipated changes to ecosystems, the group warned. ""We have proof of concept in four species in highly controlled, narrowly defined laboratory environments,"" said Elizabeth Heitman, associate professor of medical ethics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and co-chair of the panel. ""Much of what we talk about as benefit and harm is speculative.” Gene-drive technology is distinct from more conventional forms of genetic engineering, because the goal is to let the new genes drift through a broader population, propagated by sexual reproduction, rather than have them remain confined to, say, a patch of corn or soybeans. In laboratory experiments, gene drives have been successful in fruit flies, yeast and mosquitoes. There have already been attempts to use genetic engineering as a form of pest control, but these did not constitute gene drives because they didn't endure through multiple future generations. For example, in Brazil, authorities have approved a plan to fight the Zika virus using genetically engineered mosquitoes that carry a self-destruct gene. These mosquitoes have been raised with nutrients that deactivate the lethal gene. When the males are released into the wild, their offspring carry the self-destruct gene and die before maturity. The panel, echoing other recent reviews of CRISPR and associated technologies, urges a broad societal discussion about how genetic engineering proceeds. ""The question of how human beings manipulate nature, whether that’s a moral action or not, is not a new question,"" Heitman said. ""We’ve not answered that question successfully in any other technology."" The biotech watchdog ETC Group called the new report ""disappointing"" in a release headlined ""Stop the Gene Bomb!"" The organization said the new report failed to address many of the potential hazards and societal implications of the new technology, including possible use of gene drives for military purposes. For example, the organization said, gene drives could be a biological weapon targeting the human microbiome. The organization also fears that the technology will be patented and exploited for commercial purposes by large biotech corporations, including Monsanto, the frequent target of activists who oppose biotech generally. ""Historians may come to see last year's invention of a working Gene Drive as biology’s ‘nuclear’ moment. Like the first nuclear chain reaction three quarters of a century ago, the ‘mutagenic chain reaction’ denotes awesome power, potential widespread destruction and has significant geopolitical ramifications,"" ETC Group spokesman Jim Thomas said in the release.

For anyone who has ever said that all the STEM professions need is something to make them “cool” in order to attract more young people, look no further than the Breakthrough Prize award ceremony, which took place at NASA’s Hangar One in Silicon Valley Sunday. Seth MacFarlane hosted the awards show that attracted some of the biggest names in Hollywood — Kate Beckinsale, Benedict Cumberbatch, Cameron Diaz, Jon Hamm, and Eddie Redmayne — as presenters. Christina Aguilera even performed. The goal of these new awards, say the organizers, is to add an element of celebrity to the science field. That means the real stars were the 12 winners of the $3 million Breakthrough Prizes, not the Hollywood stars on stage or the Internet luminaries such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin and Jack Ma who are funding the awards. Of the 12 awards handed out, six were awarded in the life science category; five in the math category; and one in physics. In case you’re keeping track – that $3 million payout for scientific genius is twice what they pay for Nobel Prizes and three times what the MacArthur Foundation pays for its “Genius” grants. Out of the 12 big winners, here are three big ideas – one each in life sciences, math and physics – that are worth keeping an eye on in 2015: A powerful new technology for editing the human genome Imagine being able to rewrite the human genome, removing and replacing damaged genes with healthy genes, just by unlocking a common  bacterial defense mechanism. That is the essential idea behind the award-winning genome editing tool created by two researchers — Jennifer Doudna, of the University of California-Berkeley, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; and Emmanuelle Charpentier, of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research and Umea University. What they found by studying bacterial immunity is that a microbial defense mechanism called Crispr/Cas9 is actually very good at protecting genetic material from invading viruses. An enzyme released by Crispr/Cas9 can snip away the DNA strands of these attacking viruses. Push on that concept hard enough and you get “a powerful and general technology for editing genomes, with wide-ranging implications across biology and medicine.” In short, this technology might be used for correcting genetic faults at their source — at the level of the gene. Two genetic faults already being explored are those that cause cystic fibrosis and genetic blood disorders. According to Doudna, “We will see this approach being used for disorders caused by single gene defects first of all, but in the longer term, it will become possible to think about other disorders where multiple genes are involved.” The new math of cryptography, communication and storage British mathematician Richard Taylor, now affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (the old stomping grounds of Albert Einstein), picked up a prize for “numerous breakthrough results in the theory of automorphic forms.” Taylor has already helped to solve some of the biggest problems in the mathematics field, like the celebrated Fermat’s Last Theorem, which waited more than 350 years for a proof. Now, he is at the forefront of new breakthroughs in mathematics, including proofs of the Taniyama-Weil conjecture, the local Langlands conjecture for general linear groups, and the Sato-Tate conjecture. All of that may sound hopelessly obscure — a mathematician sitting around a bucolic Ivy League campus doing proofs on number theory — until you realize the amazing real-world applications of this work in mathematics. Writing in the journal of the Institute for Advanced Study in 2012, Taylor explains the real-world applications of number theory: “Today, the theory of modular arithmetic is the basis for the way DVDs store or satellites transmit large amounts of data without corrupting it. Moreover, the cryptographic codes which keep, for example, our banking transactions secure are also closely connected with the theory of modular arithmetic.” In other words, if you want better storage solutions, better cryptography for your online transactions, and better ways to communicate data, you’d better hope for new breakthroughs in number theory. An expanding universe fueled by dark energy The Nobel Prize-winning team led by Saul Perlmutter, of the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Brian P. Schmidt, Australian National University; and Adam Riess, Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, won the Breakthrough Award in the fundamental physics field for “the most unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, rather than slowing, as long had been assumed.” Even 25 years after Stephen Hawking considered this concept of a rapidly expanding universe in A Brief History of Time, this is still a mind-blowing idea — it implies that, even after 12 to 14 billion years, whatever caused the creation of the universe — the Big Bang — was so powerful and unlocked so much energy that it’s still going on today. And not just going on — but actually accelerating and becoming faster. The next question, of course, is what is causing this accelerating expansion. The general consensus among physicists is that “dark energy” is somehow accountable, stretching and pulling galaxies apart. According to scientists, approximately 68 percent of the universe is “dark energy” and 27 percent is “dark matter.” As NASA points out, that means that 95 percent of the universe is still a deep mystery: “The rest — everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter — adds up to less than 5 percent of the universe.” That could give research around this “mysterious cosmic force” a new boost. ** These Breakthrough Prizes are exciting, even if real-world commercial applications are not immediately available. As the founders of the Breakthrough Prizes point out, it’s really about science for the sake of science. And admit it, it’s already pretty cool that we’re going to get feature films about Alan Turing (“The Imitation Game”) and Stephen Hawking (“The Theory of Everything”) this year. And even cooler that the heartthrob stars of these films – Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne – actually showed up at the Breakthrough Science awards show. In the end, that might be the biggest breakthrough of all – that members of the Hollywood A-list are now looking for A-list stars to play in the worlds of science, tech, mathematics and engineering.	436	"[{""start"": 1274, ""end"": 1490, ""text"": ""A powerful new technology for editing the human genome Imagine being able to rewrite the human genome, removing and replacing damaged genes with healthy genes, just by unlocking a common  bacterial defense mechanism."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1822, ""end"": 2001, ""text"": ""What they found by studying bacterial immunity is that a microbial defense mechanism called Crispr/Cas9 is actually very good at protecting genetic material from invading viruses."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2256, ""end"": 2369, ""text"": ""In short, this technology might be used for correcting genetic faults at their source — at the level of the gene."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	444	2023-04-04T08:25:05.046517Z	2023-04-04T08:25:05.046630Z	394.393
Debates are raging about whether big data still holds the promise that was expected or whether it was just a big bust. The failure of the much-hyped Google Flu Trends to accurately predict peak flu levels since August 2011 has heightened the concerns. In my mind, there is no doubt that data analytics will one day help to improve health care and crime detection, design better products, and improve traffic patterns and agricultural yields. My concern is about how we will one day use all the data we are gathering—and the skeletons it will uncover. Think about how DNA technology is being used to free people who were wrongfully imprisoned decades ago. Imagine what supercomputers of the future will be able to do with the data that present-day data gatherers haven’t yet learned to use. Over the centuries, we gathered data on things such as climate, demographics, and business and government transactions. Our farmers kept track of the weather so that they would know when to grow their crops; we had land records so that we could own property; and we developed phone books so that we could find people. About 15 years ago we started creating Web pages on the Internet. Interested parties started collecting data about what news we read, where we shopped, what sites we surfed, what music we listened to, what movies we watched, and where we traveled to. With the advent of LinkedIn, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and many other social-media tools, we began to volunteer private information about our work history and social and business contacts and what we like—our food, entertainment, even our sexual preferences and spiritual values. Today, data are accumulating at exponentially increasing rates. There are more than 100 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, and even more video is being collected worldwide through the surveillance cameras that you see everywhere. Mobile-phone apps are keeping track of our every movement: everywhere we go; how fast we move; what time we wake. Soon, devices that we wear or that are built into our smartphones will monitor our body’s functioning; our sequenced DNA will reveal the software recipe for our physical body. The NSA has been mining our phone metadata and occasionally listening in; marketers are correlating information about our gender, age, education, location, and socioeconomic status and using this to sell more to us; and politicians are fine-tuning their campaigns. This is baby stuff compared to what lies ahead. The available tools for analyzing data are still crude; there are very few good data scientists; and companies such as Google still haven’t figured out what is the best data to analyze. This will surely change rapidly as artificial-intelligence technologies evolve and computers become more powerful and connected. We will be able to analyze all data we have collected from the beginning of time—as if we were entering a data time machine. We will be revisiting crime cases from the past, re-auditing tax returns, tracking down corruption, and learning who were the real heroes and villains. An artificially intelligent cybercop scanning all the camera data that were gathered, as well as phone records, e-mails, bank-account and credit-card data, and medical data on everyone in a city or a country, will instantly solve a crime better than Sherlock Holmes could. Our grandchildren will know of the sins we committed; Junior may wonder why grandpa was unfaithful to grandma. What is scary is that we will lose our privacy, opening the door to new types of crime and fraud. Governments and employers will gain more control over us, and have corporations reap greater profits from the information that we innocently handed over to them. More data and more computing will mean more money and power. Look at the advantage that bankers on Wall Street have already gained with high-frequency trading and how they are skimming billions of dollars from our financial system. We surely need stronger laws and technology protections. And we need to be aware of the perils. We must also realize that with our misdeeds, there will be nowhere to hide—not even in our past. There are many opportunities in this new age of data. Consider what becomes possible if we correlate information about a person’s genome, lifestyle habits, and location with their medical history and the medications they take. We could understand the true effectiveness of drugs and their side effects.  This would change the way drugs are tested and prescribed. And then, when genome data become available for hundreds of millions of people, we could discover the links between disease and DNA to prescribe personalized medications—tailored to an individual’s DNA. We are talking about a revolution in health and medicine. In schools, classes are usually so large that the teacher does not get to know the student — particularly the child’s other classes, habits, and development through the years. What if a digital tutor could keep track of a child’s progress and learn his or her likes and dislikes, teaching-style preferences, and intellectual strengths and weaknesses? Using data gathered by digital learning devices, test scores, attendance, and habits, the teacher could be informed of which students to focus on, what to emphasize, and how best to teach an individual child. This could change the education system itself. Combine the data that are available on a person’s shopping habits with knowledge of their social preferences, health, and location. We could have shopping assistants and personal designers creating new products including clothing that are 3D-printed or custom-manufactured for the individual. An artificial intelligence based digital assistant could anticipate what a person wants to wear or to eat and have it ready for them. All of these scenarios will become possible, as will thousands of other applications of data in agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and other fields. The only question is how fast will we get there—and what new nightmares we will create.	435	"[{""start"": 252, ""end"": 440, ""text"": ""In my mind, there is no doubt that data analytics will one day help to improve health care and crime detection, design better products, and improve traffic patterns and agricultural yields"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2487, ""end"": 2801, ""text"": ""The available tools for analyzing data are still crude; there are very few good data scientists; and companies such as Google still haven’t figured out what is the best data to analyze.

"LAS VEGAS -- One of the most agonizing aspects of having diabetes is the uncertainty. While you can try to manage your blood-sugar levels as best as you can through food, sleep, activity, insulin and constant monitoring, there's always a fear that it might plummet unexpectedly, leading to a medical emergency. What if there was a way to predict when this might happen? In what could lead to one of the most important breakthroughs for diabetes management in years, Medtronic and IBM have teamed up to work on an app that aims to give patients an early warning that you may be headed in this direction. Powered by Watson, the supercomputer that won on ""Jeopardy,"" the app analyzes data from Medtronic's insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices to look for patterns that suggest that something isn't quite right. In an early research project involving 600 patient cases, the team was able to predict near-term hypoglycemic events — in which the glucose in the blood is too low and can lead to seizures, coma or even death — up to three hours in advance of the symptoms. That's plenty of time, Medtronic's Annette Bruls pointed out, to enable a person with diabetes to take action to head off the event. ""It's a very complex equation all the things that people need to manage their glucose levels,"" Bruls, president of diabetes services and solutions at Medtronic said in an interview at the Consumer Electronics Show. ""What we are doing here is providing predictions, insights and in the future actionable recommendations to patients."" The algorithms are based on de-identified data from 150 million patient days collected through Medtronic wearable devices, which consist of electrodes that are inserted under the skin to measure glucose levels in tissue fluid and that beam the information in real-time to a monitoring device, such as a smartphone. Deborah DiSanzo, General Manager of IBM Watson Health, described the app is a kind of personal medical assistant for diabetes patients. ""You can imagine you are a patient with diabetes, it would help you tremendously to know when I get up in the morning and I walk my glucose level is at this level, when I eat oatmeal it goes to this level, when I eat ice cream to this level,"" DiSanzo said. In the future, she said, Watson might suggest that you go for a walk at certain times of day or could help you choose between blueberries as a snack or something else. The first iteration of the app is scheduled to come out in the summer of 2016, but DiSanzo said it will constantly be updated. ""Watson is a cognitive computer, so the more data it gets, the more it will learn,"" she said. Diabetes, a chronic disease that affects the body's ability to produce or manage insulin, is one of the world's most devastating diseases. There are more than 400 million people diagnosed with the disease and consequences of poorly managed diabetes are severe — heart failure, blindness, renal failure.

On Feb. 19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a huge step towards patient-centric medicine when it approved the marketing of genetics testing company 23andMe’s carrier test for Bloom Syndrome. This was a startling — and good — development because it affirmed the rights of consumers to drive their own health-care decisions and procedures. But it also means that it has become urgent to develop policies to regulate the rights of companies to resell data derived from the contents of our DNA and from our medical records. Not only did the FDA allow 23andMe to resume business; it also took the step of exempting these types of carrier DNA tests (such as for Tay–Sachs disease) from its pre-market review requirements.  This will have the effect of accelerating innovation, because the technology industry is “eating” medicine. Companies such as Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are developing health platforms, artificial intelligence-based analysis tools, and wearable medical sensors. Medicine has become an information technology and is advancing on an exponential curve. Here’s the back story to the FDA decision. You probably remember that the FDA forced 23andMe to remove its DNA health testing product from the market in 2013 due to “lack of scientific evidence.”  The FDA took pains to explain that it wanted to help 23andMe but that the company had failed to follow the regulatory process and to provide sufficient evidence to back up its claims of accurate detection of certain genetic markers common in breast cancer, warfarin sensitivity, and many other states of health. The shutdown riled Silicon Valley and techno-libertarians who felt that the FDA was unfairly regulating their right to information. Many physicians, for their part, protested that consumers could easily misinterpret results. The FDA argued that 23andMe had never shown clear evidence that its tests were not throwing false positives at unacceptable rates. False signals could be dangerous if misconstrued or taken as gospel. For example, genetic testing for certain gene variants closely associated with particularly noxious forms of breast cancer might encourage a woman to put herself in significant peril by undergoing radical surgery or other risky treatment for no possible benefit. This is a plausible argument. On the other hand, the regulatory process to date has stifled innovation in the area of consumer-driven genetic testing. Traditionally, anyone seeking genetic testing had to go through a physician or a formalized service with counseling and other information sessions as a key component. 23andMe, founded by Anne Wojcicki, was built on the idea that consumers are smart enough to handle their own health-care information and guide their own care. Now, apparently, the FDA is starting to agree with Wojcicki not just in words but also in deeds. 23andMe charges $99 for a partial genomics sequence and offers this as a way of tracking ancestry rather than of identifying genetic indicators of health risks. DNA sequencing costs have fallen from about $3 billion, the investment in sequencing the first human genome in 2001, to about $1,000 today. Costs will continue to fall, and the speed of sequencing will keep increasing. We can expect that within five or 10 years, full human-genome sequencing will costs less than a cup of coffee, take a couple of minutes, and become as common as a blood test. Here’s why this matters so much. The combination of cheap and good (or good enough) is powerful and inevitable. It means that, in the near future, with help from very smart artificial-intelligence systems, consumers will be able to take control of their health and obtain the care they deserve for far less than it costs today. Being cheap and good also means that people will be able to buy effective technologies online through an app store based in India or Canada, in the form of software, connected hardware, or some combination of the two. DNA tests will be done a chip on your phone case, not in a 23andMe facility. But here is my concern. 23andMe has made no secret of its ambition to become an information-services provider to large medical and drug companies. Big Pharma is champing at the bit to obtain as much individual DNA information as possible about large swathes of the populace. This will be a key part of research into what is often called “Precision Medicine,” a future when treatments will be able to more finely target ailments at the truly individual level. We lack sufficient safeguards for consumers who supply their DNA data to companies such as 23andMe. Once this information is made public, its privacy is lost forever. Devising and implementing safeguards will require significant discussion and debate, so that needs to begin now. It is encouraging that D.J. Patil, who has just been named the country’s chief data scientist, has named this topic as being amongst his most important tasks. The reality for now is, however, that we still haven’t figured out how to properly deal with personal data online beyond making requirements for disclosure of their theft. Personal DNA information will become far more critical and more important to safeguard than the details of our life circumstances. In the Exponential Era, these data will become bits and bytes for all of us, the same as a cookie on our browsers. On the one hand, I can’t wait to see what emerges as the FDA slowly releases the brakes on innovation. On the other hand, I can’t wait to see what Patil and his team come up with in terms of safeguards for people. It’s going to be a very exciting time in personalized medicine, DNA, and the e-Health space.	433	"[{""start"": 728, ""end"": 995, ""text"": ""This will have the effect of accelerating innovation, because the technology industry is “eating” medicine.

While it may sound like something straight out of a sci-fi film, the U.S. intelligence community is considering “human augmentation” and its possible implications for national security. As described in the National Intelligence Council’s 2012 long-term strategic analysis document — the fifth report of its kind — human augmentation is seen as a “game-changer.” The report detailed the potential benefits of brain-machine interfaces and neuro-enhancements, noting that “moral and ethical challenges . . . are inevitable.” The NIC analysts aren’t the only ones following the rapid growth of technology. Today there is an entire movement, called transhumanism, dedicated to promoting the use of technological advancements to enhance our physical, intellectual and psychological capabilities, ultimately transcending the limitations of the human condition. Its proponents claim that within the next several decades, living well beyond the age of 100 will be an achievable goal. Coined by biologist and eugenicist Julian Huxley (brother of author Aldous Huxley) in 1957, transhumanism remained the the terrain of science fiction authors and fringe philosophers for the better part of the 20th century. The movement gained broader interest as science advanced, leaping forward in credibility in the 1990s with the invention of the World Wide Web, the sequencing of the human genome and the exponential growth of computing power. New technologies continue to push the limits of life. CRISPR enables scientists to alter specific genes in an organism and make those changes heritable, but the advancement is so recent that regulation is still up for debate. Meanwhile, participants in the “body-hacking” movement are implanting RFID microchips and magnets into their bodies to better take advantage of potentially life-enhancing technology. (Some claim, not unfairly, that these modifications aren’t so different from much more accepted technologies such as pacemakers and intrauterine devices). Just last week, in a closed-door meeting at Harvard University, a group of nearly 150 scientists and futurists discussed a project to  synthesize the human genome, potentially making it possible to create humans with certain kinds of predetermined traits. Transhumanism, in its most extreme manifestation, is reflective of an increasingly pervasive and influential school of thought: that all problems can and should be solved with the right combination of invention, entrepreneurship and resource allocation. The movement has its critics.  Techno-utopianism is often described as the religion of Silicon Valley, in no small part because tech moguls are often the only ones with the resources to pursue it, and the only ones who stand to benefit in the near term.  As the solutions that transhumanists champion slowly enter the market, high prices leave them far out of reach for the typical consumer. Even today, the ability to make use of neuro-enhancing drugs and genetic screening for embryos greatly depends on whether one can afford them. If the benefits of human enhancement accrue only to the upper classes, it seems likely that inequality will be entrenched in ways deeper than just wealth, fundamentally challenging our egalitarian ideals. And for many religious and philosophical opponents, transhumanism appears at its core to be an anti-human movement. Rather than seeking to improve the human condition through engagement with each other, transhumanists see qualities that make up the human identity as incidental inconveniences — things to override as soon as possible. But for all its misgivings, transhumanism is making its way from the world of speculative technology into the mainstream. Google recently hired Ray Kurzweil, the inventor best known for his predictions of “the singularity” — simply put, the moment at which artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence — and his assertions that medical technology will soon allow humans to transcend death, as its chief futurist. At the same time, the Transhumanist Party is floating Zoltan Istvan as its own third-party candidate for president. The transhumanist movement is growing in followers and gaining media attention, but it’s unclear whether its particular preoccupations are inevitable enough to concern us today. Yet as technology continues to provide tools to manipulate the world around us, it becomes more and more likely that we will reach to manipulate ourselves. What could be the ramifications of a new wave of human enhancement? And what does our increasing fascination with technological futurism say about our priorities today? Over the next few days, we’ll hear from: Charles T. Rubin, political science professor at Duquesne University and blogger at the New Atlantis Ronald Bailey, science writer for Reason Ellen Jorgensen, co-founder and executive director of Genspace David Vincent Kimel, historian and philosopher at Yale University James Hughes, executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies	432	"[{""start"": 186, ""end"": 359, ""text"": ""As described in the National Intelligence Council’s 2012 long-term strategic analysis document — the fifth report of its kind — human augmentation is seen as a “game-changer"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 637, ""end"": 853, ""text"": ""called transhumanism, dedicated to promoting the use of technological advancements to enhance our physical, intellectual and psychological capabilities, ultimately transcending the limitations of the human condition."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1478, ""end"": 1648, ""text"": ""CRISPR enables scientists to alter specific genes in an organism and make those changes heritable, but the advancement is so recent that regulation is still up for debate"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1650, ""end"": 1831, ""text"": ""eanwhile, participants in the “body-hacking” movement are implanting RFID microchips and magnets into their bodies to better take advantage of potentially life-enhancing technology"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1988, ""end"": 2242, ""text"": ""Just last week, in a closed-door meeting at Harvard University, a group of nearly 150 scientists and futurists discussed a project to  synthesize the human genome, potentially making it possible to create humans with certain kinds of predetermined trait"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	440	2023-04-04T07:58:36.662169Z	2023-04-04T07:58:36.662246Z	394.986
If an overhyped vegetable existed before marketers coined the term superfood — and long before Oprah Winfrey chatted up acai berries with Dr. Oz — look no further than spinach. (Here’s to Popeye, eating the stuff by the can to inflate his biceps.) Spinach alone, of course, won’t pump anyone up. But it does have a few physical properties of the type that excite biomedical engineers. Spinach grows a network of veins, for instance, that thread through its leaves in a way similar to blood vessels through a human heart. These leafy veins allowed researchers at Massachusetts’s Worcester Polytechnic Institute to give a new meaning to heart-healthy spinach. The tissue engineers, as they reported recently in the journal Biomaterials, stripped green spinach leaves of their cells. The spinach turned translucent. The scientists seeded the gaps that the plant cells left behind with human heart tissue. Heart cells, in clusters, beat for up to three weeks in this unusual environment. The inspiration for the human-plant fusion came over lunch — and, yes, the leafy greens were involved — when WPI bioengineers Glenn Gaudette and Joshua Gershlak began to brainstorm new ways to tackle a deadly medical problem: the lack of donor organs. Of the more than 100,000 people on the donor list, nearly two dozen people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant. To meet the demand, scientists have tried to create artificial organs through innovations such as 3-D-printing tissue. So far, however, no one has been able to print a perfect heart. “One of the big problems in engineering heart muscle is getting blood flow to all of the cells,” Gaudette, a professor of biomedical engineering at WPI, told The Washington Post. “Heart muscle is pretty thick.” Current technology cannot construct tissue dense enough to replace a damaged heart while also allowing for the tiny blood vessels needed to deliver life-giving oxygen. Rather than creating minuscule blood vessels, the scientists decided to borrow from what nature already evolved. First, they removed the cells from spinach leaves purchased at a local market. “We use detergent — soaps — which strips away the cellular material of tissues,” said Gershlak, a WPI graduate student in Gaudette’s lab. “This leaves behind the protein matrix and structure.” The soap punctured plant cell membranes and washed the deflated cells away; the overall effect was not unlike turning over a garden before planting new crops. Left behind was cellulose, a plant material known to be compatible with mammal tissue, as well as the intact leaf veins. The scientists seeded the now-vacated cellulose matrix with cardiac muscle cells. After five days, the muscle cells began to beat. It was not quite as if researchers grew an entire slab of quivering muscle from spinach. And, though the scientists watched red liquid course through the spinach veins, this was dye, not blood. But to witness individual human cells contracting on a spinach leaf, via microscope, was exciting enough for Gaudette to whip out his cellphone and began recording in grainy video. “It was definitely a double take,” Gershlak said, of discovering the beating muscle cells. “All of a sudden you see cells moving.” This was not the only instance in which researchers cultivated human tissue on a plant scaffold. Recently, a team of Ottawa scientists stripped an apple of its plant cells, carved a fruit slice to look like a human ear and filled its extracellular matrix with cervical tissue. But Gershlak, Gaudette and their colleagues were the first, they said, to use the technique in an attempt to repurpose plant veins. They poured tiny spheres through the spinach leaves. Beads 10 microns in diameter, a size on par with red blood cells, successfully flowed through the vein network. Though these early experiments served as proof-of-concept work, Gaudette said the study could be the foundation for stitching the veins of spinach leaves to human blood vessels. “Long term, we’re definitely envisioning implanting a graft in damaged heart tissue,” he said. But the researchers first need to make sure that plant scaffolds like these would not be rejected, once inside a host. They also plan to make their heart-spinach hybrids stronger. “If we stack decellularized leaves, can we create a large thickness,” Gaudette wondered, “more along the thickness of a human heart wall?” One advantage of working with plants was the cornucopia of options at the scientists’ disposal. In the new report, the biomedical engineers successfully stripped plant cells from parsley, peanut hairy roots and a species of wormwood in addition to spinach. The biomedical engineers imagined that a piece of broccoli or cauliflower, once stripped of its cells, could be a foundation for growing lung tissue. And researchers in Wisconsin, collaborating with the WPI lab, recently strolled through their campus arboretum, plucking exotic leaves to test.

In last weekend’s Wall Street Journal, two leading brain researchers conjectured that as a result of rapid breakthroughs in fields such as molecular biology and neuroscience, one day “brain implants” will be just about as common as getting a bit of plastic surgery is today. In short, today’s tummy tucks are tomorrow’s brain tucks. Similar to what you’d expect from watching science fiction films such as “The Matrix,” these brain implants would enable you to learn foreign languages effortlessly, upgrade your memory capabilities, and, yes, help you to know Kung Fu. Vinton Cerf argues that today’s Internet (think Google) is already a form of cognitive implant, helping us to learn the answer to just about anything within seconds. If computing power continues to increase at the same rate as it has for the past 50 years, it is likely that a single computer will have the computing capacity of a human brain by 2023. By 2045, a single computer could have the processing capability of all human brains put together. Just think what you’d be able to use Google to do then. You wouldn’t even need to type in a search query, your brain would already know the answer.  Of course, the ability to create these brain implants raises a number of philosophical, ethical and moral questions. If you’re a young student having a tough time in a boring class, why not just buy a brain module that simulates the often repetitive nature of learning? If you’re a parent of a child looking to get into a top university, why not buy a brain implant as a way to gain an advantage over children from less privileged backgrounds, especially when it’s SAT time? Instead of the digital divide, we may be talking about the cognitive divide at some point in the next two decades. Some parents would be able to afford a 99 percent percentile brain for their children, while others wouldn’t. While the first cognitive implants won’t be around for some time, we’ve already had a glimpse of what’s possible. DARPA is working on enhancements for soldiers that give them powers of hyper-concentration, the ability to have super-memories and the capability to recover from PTSD. Researchers at UC Berkeley are working on a wireless brain interface called “neural dust.” And researchers at Wake Forest are working on ways to implant artificial memories in rats and monkeys. Meanwhile, the work on neuroprosthetics continues to advance at a rapid pace, giving hope that people will be able to routinely control artificial limbs with their brains one day soon. The dizzying pace of technological change is not only getting faster, it’s also leading to the creation of new disciplines. Rapid advances in computing power now means overlaps are occurring  in fields such as molecular biology and optical engineering (optogenetics), or neuroscience and biomedical engineering (neuroprosthetics). At some point, the technologies used to create better machines will be used to create better humans. And vice versa.  And all of that change is set to speed up in the future, as the result of massive new scientific initiatives like the $100 million BRAIN initiative financed by the Obama administration in 2013. Once we know how each element of the brain works and can map the brain’s neurons in 3D, it’s really just a matter of time before we can create “super-children” capable of great feats of learning or “super-athletes” who are always in the zone as the result of their ability for hyper-concentration. Many now compare mapping the human brain to mapping the human genome. Most likely, the technological adoption curve will go from using cognitive implants to reverse the effects of diseases such as Alzheimer’s or autism, then to “getting a little work done” to overcome the effects of aging, and finally, to using cognitive implants as an enhancement for super-children and super-athletes. Let’s just hope society’s philosophers and ethicists are able to keep up with the rapid gain in cognitive potential made possible by this new knowledge of how the human brain works — and that the machines allow us to catch up with them. 	430	"[{""start"": 1982, ""end"": 2149, ""text"": ""DARPA is working on enhancements for soldiers that give them powers of hyper-concentration, the ability to have super-memories and the capability to recover from PTSD."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2150, ""end"": 2342, ""text"": ""Researchers at UC Berkeley are working on a wireless brain interface called “neural dust.” And researchers at Wake Forest are working on ways to implant artificial memories in rats and monkeys"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2344, ""end"": 2527, ""text"": ""Meanwhile, the work on neuroprosthetics continues to advance at a rapid pace, giving hope that people will be able to routinely control artificial limbs with their brains one day soon"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3470, ""end"": 3759, ""text"": ""Many now compare mapping the human brain to mapping the human genome.

Leaders of an international conference warned Thursday that it would be “irresponsible” to use a new gene-editing technique on human embryo, sperm or egg cells until questions of safety are addressed and there is “broad societal consensus” on the purpose of the effort. The criteria for clinical research or therapeutic use of that type of gene alteration haven’t been met yet, the organizing committee of the International Summit on Human Gene Editing wrote in a statement issued at the end of the three-day conference. “The safety issues have not yet been adequately explored” and the prospects for even the most beneficial uses are currently limited, they said. The conference at the National Academies of Sciences was called because a revolutionary way of editing genes — known as CRISPR-Cas9 — allows many scientists to alter genes in plants and animals quickly and inexpensively. The technology, which takes advantage of the way bacteria defend against viruses, was developed in just the past four years. The meeting was led by U.S., Chinese and British science and medical academies. Chinese scientists made news earlier this year when it was revealed that they had been applying gene-editing to nonviable human embryos. The summit statement acknowledged the many “promising and valuable” uses for gene editing of somatic cells — which don’t transmit the human genome to succeeding generations. In a single individual, for example, proposals to alter genes to eliminate sickle cell anemia or strengthen immune cells’ ability to fight cancer can be undertaken within existing rules, the statement said, though scientists need to understand the risks and benefits of each therapy. But modifying genes in “germline” cells involved in human reproduction would pass the alterations to all the cells of resulting offspring and into the human gene pool. That, the summit suggested, is a step that should not yet be taken, even to eradicate heritable diseases. They said that risks include inaccurate gene editing that might produce unwanted mutations; the difficulty of predicting harmful effects; the difficulty of removing any harmful modifications from the gene pool; inequality that might result from enhancing one group of people but not another; and “the moral and ethical considerations in purposely altering human evolution.” If genes in embryos or germline cells are edited for research only, the organizers added, “the modified cells should not be used to establish a pregnancy.” As scientific knowledge advances and society’s views evolve, the statement added, these questions should be revisited. An ongoing forum for discussion of possible uses should be established by the international hosts, with representation for scientists, ethicists, patients, health-care providers, funders, faith leaders, private industry and others.	429	"[{""start"": 665, ""end"": 885, ""text"": ""The conference at the National Academies of Sciences was called because a revolutionary way of editing genes — known as CRISPR-Cas9 — allows many scientists to alter genes in plants and animals quickly and inexpensively."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1228, ""end"": 1400, ""text"": ""The summit statement acknowledged the many “promising and valuable” uses for gene editing of somatic cells — which don’t transmit the human genome to succeeding generations"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	437	2023-04-04T07:39:58.638493Z	2023-04-04T07:39:58.638599Z	157.16
Lockheed Martin is more commonly known for its weapons business, building the most expensive fighter jet of all time or more recently moving into armored tanks. But as defense spending remains sluggish, it has set its sights on everything from climate change to space travel to nuclear fusion. Now Lockheed has turned its attention to one of the most complicated frontiers of all – the human body. The Bethesda-based contractor announced an alliance of industry, government and academia this week to brainstorm the future of health-care technology. Those involved include everyone from Silicon Valley heavyweights Intel and Cisco to a small Georgia analytics company and Montgomery College, a community college in suburban Maryland. The group, known as the Healthcare Technology Alliance, will tackle some of the biggest challenges facing health care today, such as how to use precision medicine, how to protect patient privacy in the era of big data, how to improve veterans’ health and how to build a skilled scientific workforce of the future. The alliance is a progression of Lockheed’s recent forays into the fast-growing health care IT sector. It announced a partnership this year with Illumina, a San Diego firm that builds genetic sequencing machines. The two are studying the human genome by analyzing data from large populations. Illumina has also joined the alliance. Last fall, Lockheed bought Syracuse health care company Systems Made Simple, which specialized in digital health care work with Veterans Affairs. At a launch event in Northern Virginia this week, members of the alliance said the health care industry was evolving at a rapid clip. To keep up and innovate, they said, government agencies, companies and educational institutions need to band together. At its outset, most members are already involved in projects that could serve as pilots. For instance, the Million Veteran Project is a VA research project that aims to collect genetic data from volunteers to better understand diseases like diabetes and cancer, and military-related illnesses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The program has amassed data from 400,000 veterans so far, said Alex Dickinson, Illumina’s senior vice president of strategic initiatives. Illumina is following the progress of the project, he said. The company is also involved in discussions around President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative. In another example, Intel is working with Big Cloud Analytics, an Atlanta-based predictive analytics company, to collect and study data from wearable devices to identify patient health patterns. Insurers can use that information to gain insight into their customers’ health and behavior, a Big Cloud spokesperson said. Executives from Cisco and big data storage company Cloudera stressed the need for better data security and management as health care providers and government agencies collect massive amounts of information about patients. And finally, a pipeline of young talent is critical for improving health-care technology in the years to come, Montgomery College president DeRionne Pollard said.

At the gene-editing summit, you can’t miss George Church. He’s the big guy with the bushy beard and wavy hair, someone who looks like he stepped out of an 18th century painting of “natural philosophers.” Church, who is 61, is among several hundred scientists, policymakers and thinkers on hand to discuss the powerful technology known as CRISPR, a new method for editing genes. The technique was invented in the past four years, and Church is among those who can claim at least partial credit for the innovation (there’s an intense legal battle over patents — a story for another day). I mentioned to Church that this is the kind of work for which Nobels are awarded. He quickly responded that there are more important things in the balance than prizes. There are cures for human diseases, he said. [How George Church used gene editing to improve the likelihood of pig-to-human organ transplants] Church thinks that one of the ailments he can cure is aging. When I met him early this year, in his laboratory at Harvard Medical School, where he is professor of genetics, he expressed confidence that in just five or six years he will be able to reverse the aging process in human beings. “A scenario is, everyone takes gene therapy — not just curing rare diseases like cystic fibrosis, but diseases that everyone has, like aging,” he said. He noted that mice die after 2.5 years but bowhead whales can live to be 180 or 200. “One of our biggest economic disasters right now is our aging population. If we eliminate retirement, then it buys us a couple of decades to straighten out the economies of the world,” he said. Eliminate retirement? (I briefly envisioned being on deadline in my 90s.) “If all those gray hairs could go back to work and feel healthy and young,” he said, “then we’ve averted one of the greatest economic disasters in history.” He went on: “Someone younger at heart should replace you, and that should be you. I’m willing to. I’m willing to become younger. I try to reinvent myself every few years anyway.” So on Tuesday, I asked him if he was still on track to reversing the aging process in the next five years or so. He said yes — and that it’s already happening in mice in the laboratory. The best way to predict the future, he said, is to predict things that have already happened. Even without CRISPR, genetic engineering was becoming part of the fabric of modern life (your grocery store is full of products from soybeans and corn that have been genetically modified in laboratories). The big difference with CRISPR is how cheap it is, how handy, how flexible. This will put an amazing tool in the hands of a lot more researchers. (Another co-inventor of CRISPR, Feng Zhang, told the summit attendees that soon there will be an entire “toolbox” of CRISPR-like techniques that can be used to edit genes.) For most of us lay people, what’s striking here is not the way that scientists fiddle with the code of life but the mere fact that they do it at all. Awed though we may be by the skills of the experimenters, we naturally question whether this is a good idea. That’s the whole point of the gene-editing summit: To find a path forward that fosters innovation but avoids crossing into ethically dubious territory. Gene-editing could be a tool for eliminating heritable diseases. But it just as easily could be used for purely cosmetic enhancements, or for something smacking of eugenics. The gravest concern is that CRISPR enables germline edits that get passed on to future generations. You’re permanently changing the human species when you do that. Who calls the shots here? Intellectual humility requires scientists to go slowly. Editing genes isn’t like renovating your kitchen. As  Klaus Rajewsky, of the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, pointed out Tuesday, “We have become masters in the art of manipulating genes, but our understanding of their function and interaction is far more limited.” Eric Lander, who heads the Broad Institute in Cambridge and was a leader of the effort to sequence the human genome, offered a valediction to Tuesday’s session that addressed both the enormous possibilities of the new technologies and the reasons for being extremely cautious. He said there are 4,000 to 5,000 genetic variants associated with human diseases. But these variants don’t necessarily cause those diseases; they just make them slightly more prevalent. Moreover, genes can have multiple purposes — day jobs and night jobs, as Lander put it. These are complex systems, not modules that you can pop out and replace with a better version with zero unintended consequences. Lander said he could think of only a handful of human diseases that CRISPR could plausibly address at this time, and even then, he said, we should ask whether such genetic manipulation is a good idea. That’s because Nature has had millions of years to do the same experiment and has not done so. “If it is such a good idea, I want to scratch my head and say why didn’t evolution try to do that, and increase that in the population?” Lander said. “We largely exist in a state of limited knowledge,” he said. “Before we make permanent changes to the human gene pool, we should exercise considerable caution.” Which brings us back to aging. Is it a bug, or a feature? — In reporting this item I came across a story I wrote on biotech [please forgive bad formatting] and Craig Venter, published on Nov. 29, 1998, in the Post magazine. The most surprising line came from Venter: “Intelligent application of this technology is one to two centuries away.” A surprising comment from one of the big boosters of synthetic biology. The story ends with my quasi-neo-crypto-Luddite peroration: Perfection may be a dangerous goal. Nature has feedback systems. There are microbes that adapt to our every move. We think of ourselves as the rulers of the planet; the microbes think of us as a useful host. At some level, we’re still just a bunch of meat. Perfection may not even be a goal worth pursuing. There is something more interesting about a mortal, imperfect life. Here’s a thought: The revolutionaries of the future will be the people who keep their lives natural. They will choose to grow old. They will allow themselves to experience pain and suffering, so that their joys and triumphs will be all the more intense. They will walk in the woods and sing songs and appreciate the bounty of the planet. Two lovers might put down a blanket and have a picnic. They will fall asleep, because they still get sleepy. They will do this instead of going to the lab to be genetically reengineered.

In April 2015, a paper by Chinese scientists about their attempts to edit the DNA of a human embryo rocked the scientific world and set off a furious debate. Leading scientists warned that altering the human germ line without studying the consequences could have horrific consequences. Geneticists with good intentions could mistakenly engineer changes in DNA that generate dangerous mutations and cause painful deaths. Scientists — and countries — with less noble intentions could again try to build a race of superhumans. Human DNA is, however, merely one of many commercial targets of ethical concern. The DNA of every single organism — every plant, every animal, every bacterium — is now fair game for genetic manipulation. We are entering an age of backyard synthetic biology that should worry everybody. And it is coming about because of CRISPRs: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. Discovered by scientists only a few years ago, CRISPRs are elements of an ancient system that protects bacteria and other single-celled organisms from viruses, acquiring immunity to them by incorporating genetic elements from the virus invaders. CRISPRs evolved over millions of years to trim pieces of genetic information from one genome and insert it into another. And this bacterial antiviral defencs serves as an astonishingly cheap, simple, elegant way to quickly edit the DNA of any organism in the lab. Until recently, editing DNA required sophisticated labs, years of experience, and many thousands of dollars. The use of CRISPRs has changed all that. CRISPRs work by using an enzyme — Cas9 — that homes in on a specific location in a strand of DNA. The process then edits the DNA to either remove unwanted sequences or insert payload sequences. CRISPRs use an RNA molecule as a guide to the DNA target.  To set up a CRISPR editing capability, a lab only needs to order an RNA fragment (costing about $10) and purchase off-the-shelf chemicals and enzymes for $30 or less. Because CRISPR is cheap and easy to use, it has both revolutionized and democratized genetic research. Hundreds, if not thousands, of labs are now experimenting with CRISPR-based editing projects. A race is on between the major research institutions to file CRISPR-technique patents.  Research dollars, both public and private, are pouring into CRISPR projects. Meanwhile, a panoply of leading geneticists — including one of the developers of the CRISPR technology — has urged for a moratorium on alterations to the human germ line until the implications of messing with human DNA are further studied and safeguards put in place. Changing human DNA creates, for scientists and humanity, a frightening ethical grey zone. On the one hand, for the many millions of poor souls suffering from diseases arising from genetic defects, CRISPR and the research it fuels could mean finding a cure for their problem in their lifetimes. On the other hand, changing the human germ line is incredibly risky without much better knowledge of how our DNA actually works. Though scientists now commonly sequence human DNA, they still struggle to understand how the different pieces of the human genome work together. For example, until recently, scientists thought that much of our genetic material was useless and served no purpose. They called it “junk” DNA. In a previous era, they might have considered editing the junk out of our genes. Now, research is emerging showing that junk DNA plays a key role in regulating genetic expression (effectively turning various genes on and off), regulation that is fundamental to the biological processes that govern our bodies and our endocrine systems. What if a well-intentioned researcher develops a cure for one of these diseases and shares it with thousands of sufferers before realizing that the cure is far worse than the disease and that the side effects are painful — or even deadly — and easily spread from person to person? Such a scenario could arise through good intent. But in the hands of evil biohackers, these powerful and simple tools are a cause for alarm. A smart biohacker could alter the influenza genome, for example, to make it more potent, setting off an epidemic that kills hundreds of millions of people.  Though a nuclear weapon can cause tremendous long-lasting damage, the ultimate biological doomsday machine is bacteria, because they can spread so quickly and quietly. No one is prepared for an era when editing DNA is as easy as editing a Microsoft Word document. The government does not have any regulations on editing human DNA. The ethical concerns have not been fleshed out. There is no centralized risk-management inventory, listing which labs are doing what with CRISPR. It’s all rather terrifying. Rarely do I argue that a moratorium on technological progress is the prudent course. But the stakes in the case of CRISPR are so high that I believe a blanket moratorium is the only course.  Yes, rogue scientists may nonetheless continue working at modifications on the human germ line; and that could endow them with a first-mover advantage and unfair knowledge. But such a moratorium could be as effective as the global moratorium on the cloning of humans has been: at the least, scientists such as those who engineered the human embryos in China would become international pariahs rather than being celebrated for publishing papers in prestigious publications.	425	"[{""start"": 728, ""end"": 911, ""text"": ""We are entering an age of backyard synthetic biology that should worry everybody.

Most of a person’s genetic risk for common diseases such as diabetes, asthma and hardening of the arteries appears to lie in the shadowy part of the human genome once disparaged as “junk DNA.” Indeed, the vast majority of human DNA seems to be involved in maintaining individuals’ well being — a view radically at odds with what biologists have thought for the past three decades. Those are among the key insights of a nine-year project to study the 97 percent of the human genome that’s not, strictly speaking, made up of genes. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Project, nicknamed Encode, is the most comprehensive effort to make sense of the totality of the 3 billion nucleotides that are packed into our cells. The project’s chief discovery is the identification of about 4 million sites involved in regulating gene activity. Previously, only a few thousand such sites were known. In all, at least 80 percent of the genome appears to be active at least sometime in our lives. Further research may reveal that virtually all of the DNA passed down from generation to generation has been kept for a reason. “This concept of ‘junk DNA’ is really not accurate. It is an outdated metaphor,” said Richard Myers of the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Alabama. Myers is one of the leaders of the project, involving more than 400 scientists at 32 institutions. Another Encode leader, Ewan Birney of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Britain, said: “The genome is just alive with stuff. We just really didn’t realize that beforehand.” “What I am sure of is that this is the science for this century,” he said. “In this century, we will be working out how humans are made from this instruction manual.” The new insights are contained in six papers published Wednesday in the journal Nature. More than 20 related papers are appearing elsewhere. The human genome consists of about 3 billion nucleotides — the “letters” — strung one to another in chains. Specific stretches of those nucleotides carry the instructions for making specific proteins. The proteins, in turn, become the blocks of tissues and the enzymes, hormones and carrier molecules that do most of the cell’s work. The Human Genome Project identified the correct linear sequence of those letters. At its completion in 2003, only 21,000 genes had been identified — far fewer than most biologists predicted. Furthermore, the genes constituted only 3 percent of the cell’s DNA, leaving biologists to wonder about what function, if any, the remaining 97 percent had. Encode was created to try to answer that question. “Back then we got the book, but we didn’t know how to read it,” said Elise Feingold of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the federal agency that provided about $200 million for the project. The new research helps explain how so few genes can create an organism as complex as a human being. The answer is that regulation — turning genes on and off at different times in different types of cells, adjusting a gene’s output and coordinating its activities with other genes — is where most of the action is. The importance and subtlety of gene regulation is not a new idea. Nor is the idea that parts of the genome once thought to be “junk” may have some use. What the Encode findings reveal is the magnitude of the regulation. In one paper, a team led by Thomas R. Gingeras of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York reported that three-quarters of the genome’s DNA is “transcribed” into a related molecule, RNA, at some point in life. A small amount of that RNA is then “translated” into protein. Much of the rest appears to have gene-regulating activities that remain to be discovered. In a telephone conference call with reporters, several of the researchers likened the 4 million regulatory sites to electrical switches in a hugely complex wiring diagram. By turning switches on and off, and varying the duration of their activity, a nearly infinite number of circuits can be formed. Similarly, by activating and modulating gene function, immensely complicated events such as the development of a brain cell or a liver cell from the same starting materials is possible. To see the switches in their different states, the researchers used more than 150 different cell types and conducted about 1,600 experiments altogether. “There is a modest number of genes and an immense number of elements that choreograph how those genes are used,” said Eric D. Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. The Encode project created a catalogue of the stretches of DNA that show evidence of biological activity. But exactly what they do in most cases is not known. The findings will be especially useful in interpreting “genome-wide association studies” (GWAS), which are key tools in the emerging field of personalized medicine. In GWAS research, the genomes of people with a specific disease — Type 2 diabetes, coronary atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis — are compared with the genomes of people without the disease. Usually a dozen or more small changes in DNA sequence are found to be more common in people with the disease than those without it. Sometimes the importance of those DNA “variants” is obvious. But often they are found in perplexing regions of the genome, far from the gene for the enzyme or protein involved in the disease. Now, researchers suspect that 10 times as many risk variants occur in the regulatory “switches” as in the genes themselves. The researchers cited the example of Crohn’s disease, an ailment that causes painful and dangerous inflammation of the intestines. Previous studies had identified several mutations associated with the illness. Encode showed that some were sites where a specific “transcription factor” called GATA2 binds. But how that may trigger the disease is, for the moment, unknown.	424	"[{""start"": 1459, ""end"": 1618, ""text"": ""“The genome is just alive with stuff.

"Rule one of journalism is that if you have any plausible reason to mention Jennifer Lopez in a highly technical story about genetics and biochemistry, go for it! And so we have. Lopez, according to the Hollywood Reporter, is hoping to produce a dramatic TV series titled “C.R.I.S.P.R.,"" which would feature male and female protagonists trying to save humanity from a mad scientist. According to THR: In the same vein of Castle, romance will blossom between the scientist and the FBI agent as they team to bring down a diabolical genius with a twisted God complex: her former boss. The drama will see mentor and protege battle for control over the human genome in a game of cat and mouse in which the future of our species may rest and all disease could one day be eradicated. The bad scientist with the God complex apparently is devilish in his use of the gene-editing technique known as CRISPR (which stands for, as you may know by now, “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats""). NBC has asked for scripts, according to THR, but the network has yet to order a pilot, and so this show may yet evaporate, along with a million other dreams and aspirations, in the Southern California sunshine. (A spokesman for NBCUniversal told us by email, "" 'CRISPR' is actually just in development, as you noted, and we don’t comment on those projects until they actually move along, if they do at all."") Now, the news: Researchers at Yale and Carnegie Mellon universities have published a paper in Nature Communications revealing a completely different method of editing genes and targeting mutations that cause diseases. The new technique is not nearly as simple as CRISPR, but it's less likely to miss its target. That could make it potentially safer than CRISPR for gene therapy in human patients. Although genetic manipulation has been around for decades, CRISPR has exploded in the last few years as a favored technique because it is versatile, inexpensive and relatively easy. Some of the key ingredients for this kind of gene editing can be ordered online and delivered by express mail. The CRISPR system was actually invented by bacteria in the distant past. Cells have their own complex systems for repairing the genome. CRISPR exploits a natural enzyme called Cas-9 that can target a section of a genetic code and snip out mutated or damaged segments. The problem is that this is not yet a perfect science. CRISPR's genome-snipping isn't always in the right place. Scientists claim progress in limiting off-target effects, but CRISPR to this point hasn't matured enough as a technique to be used in human therapies. “It's so good at cutting the genome, it tends to make cuts at the wrong place, too. I think our technology is much harder to make, but we believe it's much more specific, with less off-target effects,” said Peter Glazer, a Yale University geneticist and the co-author of the new study. Glazer teamed with other scientists, including Danith Ly, a professor of chemistry at Carnegie Mellon, to develop a technique that takes synthetic genetic material — PNAs, for peptide nucleic acids — and injects it directly into the bloodstream of a mouse with a blood disease. The new study reports on the results of experiments on mice with the blood disease thalassemia, which is relatively common in humans and inhibits their levels of hemoglobin. Thalassemia is caused by a single mutation in the genetic code. The synthetic PNAs, injected into the mouse, are designed to bind with the mice DNA to form a kind of bump on the genome. Indeed, instead of the usual double helix, that stretch of modified DNA will now have a triple helix. A cell has molecules that continually scan the DNA for something that doesn't look right, and “triplex DNA” is just such an anomaly. So the cell deploys its repair machinery to snip away the offending DNA segment. The laboratory technique developed by Glazer, Ly and their colleagues requires a second maneuver, the deployment of a DNA patch that contains a normal, non-mutant version of the hemoglobin gene. Ideally the DNA strand will repair itself by plugging in this non-mutant genetic patch. This is tricky stuff and only works on a small percentage of cells. But — amazingly — even that level of efficiency is enough to suppress the diseases studied so far, the scientists say. Major caveat: This has only been done in mice. Will it work in humans? “That’s the goal, to try to replicate this mouse model in humans,” Ly told The Washington Post. Now, back to Hollywood and its insatiable desire for stories about mad scientists. It was two centuries ago that Mary Shelley conjured up her tale of “Frankenstein,” and we are unlikely to escape the trope of the mad scientist anytime soon. But Glazer, for one, points out a fundamental truth about the human genome: It's really complicated. There's usually not a single genetic marker for physical traits or diseases. “It's only the very obvious, single-gene disorders like sickle cell anemia where you have the obvious thing to edit,” Glazer said. If someone asked him to create a human being who, for example, could run faster, he'd have no idea how to do it, he said. The only people who know how to do something like that are the people in Hollywood."	423	"[{""start"": 1627, ""end"": 1805, ""text"": ""he new technique is not nearly as simple as CRISPR, but it's less likely to miss its target.

"About 150 scientists assembled at Harvard on Tuesday for an off-the-record, no-media-allowed discussion of how to create, from scratch, an intact genome, including the genetic code of a human being. The idea is to go beyond ""reading"" genetic material to actively ""writing"" it, George Church, a Harvard Medical School researcher who helped organized the event, told The Post in an interview Friday morning. Scientists can synthesize DNA chemically, and these techniques could ultimately lead to complete genomes that could be implanted in cells for research purposes. No one should panic just yet about mad scientists running amok: The researchers are not talking about making synthetic human beings. But the gathering drew a rebuke from two academics who heard about the event and didn't think it should have been held behind closed doors. Drew Endy, associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, and Laurie Zoloth, a professor of medical ethics and humanities at Northwestern University, published an essay this week raising questions about whether the gathering at Harvard had gone too far. After citing the beneficial possibilities of such research, they raised the thornier ethical questions: In a world where human reproduction has already become a competitive marketplace, with eggs, sperm and embryos carrying a price, it is easy to make up far stranger uses of human genome synthesis capacities. Would it be OK, for example, to sequence and then synthesize Einstein’s genome?  If so how many Einstein genomes should be made and installed in cells, and who would get to make them? Taking a step back, just because something becomes possible, how should we approach determining if it is ethical to pursue? Meanwhile, Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Berkeley, Calif.-based Center for Genetics and Society, a politically progressive organization that has had a skeptical view of biotechnology, issued a statement Friday criticizing the Harvard gathering: ""If these reports are accurate, the meeting looks like a move to privatize the current conversation about heritable genetic modification."" Church told The Post that the meeting was originally supposed to be open. The organizers had planned to stream video of the event, and invite numerous journalists, he said. But they had also hoped to pair the event with an article, written by many scientists, that had submitted to a major scientific journal. The article still hasn't been published and the organizers decided to keep the event private, Church said. He said the organizers wanted to avoid being accused of ""science by press release"" without a peer-reviewed article backing them up. He said the video of the event will be released when the peer-reviewed article is published, likely in the very near future. ""It wasn't secret.

As we look ahead to 2016, you’ll again hear the words “gamer-changer” or “breakthrough” get thrown around a lot. It seems like everything these days from pasta to toothbrushes — heck, even the wheel, is being re-imagined. However, very few innovations qualify as life-altering. We’re talking about the kind of progress that’ll go a long way toward eradicating the spread of disease, increasing longevity and lead to healthier sex lives. These advances free up more time for the joys of virtual reality and hoverboards. They make good on humanity’s designs to expand its reach ever further into outer space. Of course, its also crucial that we get to a point where any and all such futuristic endeavors can be fueled by 100 percent clean energy. In that sense, 2015 was the year science and technology moved a step closer to bringing about this shared vision. Here’s the rundown of how it happened: 1. Battery storage goes big  More and more renewable energy, while always a good thing, won’t be enough. That’s the take-home message from Tesla chief executive Elon Musk when he took the stage in April to unveil Powerwall, a home battery system designed to store and supply solar energy. On paper, clean sources of energy are exponentially more than capable of replacing fossil fuels. If humans were somehow able to convert 1/10,000 of the sunlight that the earth receives, the world would have all the fuel it currently needs. And according to a study published in Nature Climate Change, wind power from turbines alone can satisfy global energy demands more than 100 times over. Solar energy, of course, isn’t readily available round the clock or year round. Nor is it economically feasible to erect a wind turbine for every square mile. Home and commercial battery systems help to fill in these gaps by storing excess energy collected during daylight hours and releasing it in the evening. The Powerwall unit, which starts at $3,000 for the 7 kWh capacity version, has been criticized for not being cost-effective for many homeowners compared to what they would typically pay for electricity once the cost of installation and other necessary components, such as a DC-AC inverter, are taken into account. But it’s less expensive than other rechargeable home battery systems with the expectation that costs for manufacturing and Tesla Energy’s technology will drop over time. 2. Reusable space rockets prove themselves Despite a string of unsuccessful attempts, Elon Musk’s SpaceX team had been closing in on becoming the first to send a rocket into outer space and return it back to Earth fully intact. Coming up with a rocket that’s refuel-able and reusable would significantly reduce the cost of space missions, which average about $1.5 billion per launch. And when private space firm Blue Origin, founded by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, unexpectedly took home the honors in November by safely landing the BE-3 rocket after a 62-mile journey to the tip of outer space, Musk took the news in stride, even tweeting out some congratulatory props. (Disclosure: Bezos owns The Washington Post.) But just a month later, SpaceX one-upped the feat, landing a Falcon 9 rocket that traveled twice as far. In response, Bezos took to Twitter to say in a cheeky manner “Welcome to the club!”  Not exactly Russia and the United states in the 60’s, but it appears a new kind of space race is indeed on. 3. “Female Viagra” arrives The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of flibanserin, a pill dubbed as the “female viagra” and championed by its backers as a milestone notch for women’s empowerment, came with a fair bit of controversy. While considered to be the first treatment option to help women experiencing debilitatingly low sexual desire, detractors derided the decision as more a triumph of public relations than anything revolutionary, thanks to a formidable marketing campaign that included a broad coalition of women’s groups. Previously the drug had been rejected by the FDA twice as experts expressed concern over a host of serious side effects such as low blood pressure, nausea, dizziness, sleepiness and fainting. The efficacy, they also noted, was modest with those who participated in clinical trials reporting about one more satisfying sexual experience a month compared to the placebo group. The real breakthrough, however may lie in the fact that the drug appears to work by targeting neurotransmitters that regulate desire and boost libido, which inevitably declines as we age (viagra and other drugs in the same class differ in that they’re used primarily to aid in blood flow to genitals). Another promising compound is Bremelanotide, a synthetic hormone, that targets the melanocortin receptor in the hypothalamus, which plays a role in maintaining a healthy weight as well as arousal. In a sense the first FDA-approved aphrodisiac has arrived, an achievement that bodes well for similar — and possibly even better — pharmaceutical compounds currently in the works for both men and women. 4. Virtual reality moves toward the mainstream This was supposed to be the year in which the masses would be immersed up to their eyeballs in the world of virtual reality. And it did happen — kind of. Following the release of various developer editions from Facebook-acquired Oculus as well as Samsung, early adopters were finally able to get their hands on the first high-end virtual reality product in the form of the Samsung Gear VR ($99), released in late November. As the first polished entrant into what’s expected to be a crowded category, first impressions of the technology were mostly favorable, despite some noted shortcomings. For example, the Oculus-based interface, which requires a compatible Samsung smartphone, offers a fairly wide selection of games and apps. On the other hand, what users actually get is a simpler, somewhat limited virtual reality experience called mobile VR, albeit in a easily portable device. For full-on interactivity, consumers will soon be looking to desktop and console-based systems such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, which are designed to take advantage of external cameras that track your positioning in space to allow for a wider range of motion and interactivity. Both products are slated to enter the market next year. 5. Experimental anti-aging drugs get the go-ahead Recent discoveries have shown that diseases and the decline in health that comes with aging aren’t as inevitable as once thought. And though the research has yet to turn up anything conclusive — in humans at least — the emerging science of longevity is poised to break new ground in the battle against against father time. For instance, compounds such as rapamycin, an immunosupressant, and Resveratrol, found in the skin of grapes, have been the subject of intense study in recent years after experiments that showed administering them to mice dramatically extended their lifespan. More notably, the FDA has decided recently to approve the testing of Metformin, a widely used diabetes medication, for the treatment of aging. Supporting evidence for the drug’s possible anti-aging benefits come from animal studies and data from patients that pointed to lower incidences of cancer. Even then, it was a hard sell. Investigators had to work out a study design that can demonstrate that warding off the effects of aging can be as viable a way of combating disease as drugs prescribed to patients. In an interview with Nature, Nir Barzilai, a physician at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York who will serves as lead researcher, put it this way: “What we want to show is that if we delay aging, that’s the best way to delay disease.” The trial, called Targeting Aging with Metformin, or TAME, is scheduled to start in 2016. 6. Blood tests becoming less of a pain Blood tests have long been one of those universally dreaded things. They hurt and can be especially taxing for the elderly and those whose health had been compromised. That was until it Theranos, a much-hyped biotech start-up, announced what seemed like quantum leap in advancing one of the medical industry’s most vital tools. But since October, the start-up with $9 billion dollars worth of backing has been facing intense scrutiny after a blockbuster report in the Wall Street Journal raised questions over the effectiveness of the firm’s highly-secretive breakthrough technique for screening for a wide multitude of infections and conditions using a single drop of blood — and at a fraction of the cost of conventional laboratories. Still, the controversy shouldn’t overshadow the fact that there’s been considerable progress toward making the procedure quick and painless. In May, start-up Tasso received a $3 million DARPA grant to further development on HemoLink, an experimental device that relies on a unique suction method, rather than needles, to draw a tiny amount of blood for testing. And just earlier this month, search giant Google was spotted filing a patent for a smartwatch that collected blood samples using a similar pressure-based technology. At Columbia University in New York, a team of researchers announced in June that they had developed a DNA-based blood test that can detect every virus a person has ever had. Being able to precisely pare down and sort out various infections would not only allow for the early detection of HIV and Hepatitis C, but also help scientists better track disease patterns in various populations as well as shed light on how certain antibodies play into the emergence of auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. 7. With hoverboards, inventors scramble to go “Back to the Future” In retrospect, it would make perfect sense that it would be the year of the hoverboard. In “Back to the Future,” the fictional timeline was set in 2015 and Marty McFly had one. Heck, that means everyone else should too. The urgency to delivery or at least cash in on what many fans of the classic film were treating as some sort of prophetic deadline became increasingly real late last year. It was around that time that inventors Jill and Greg Henderson started a Kickstarter campaign for the Hendoboard Hoverboard, a skateboard designed to allow riders to ride on a cushion generated by the magnetic force created when spinning magnets repel against a copper surface. The catch was that, well, streets aren’t made of metal. There were other clunky attempts. The Omni Hoverboard, the brainchild of a Canadian inventor, used noisy propellers that quickly ran out of power after about a minute. Lexus’s hoverboard, which briefly made the rounds with a viral promotional video released back in June, turned out to be little more than a publicity stunt as it required magnets along the flooring. The latest effort, the Arcaboard, which claims to come the closest to offering a truly futuristic hovering experience, costs $19,000 and requires a 36 battery-array to power a ducted motor system. Even then, it’ll run for about six minutes before needing to be recharged. The only “hoverboards” to actually hit the market so far arrived as essentially hands-free segways that don’t actually hover. And despite growing popularity, the boards have been banned by airlines due to safety concerns over potentially faulty lithium ion-powered batteries. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission even got involved, launching a probe into several cases in which hoverboards basically caught fire and exploded. Fortunately, Nike did come through — just I had predicted — with the release of Marty McFly-ish self-tying sneakers, though the initial batch appears to have been reserved exclusively for in-the-know celebrities. Oh well, onward to 2016. This post has been updated to clarify the FDA approval process that flibanserin went through.	421	"[{""start"": 4612, ""end"": 4807, ""text"": ""Another promising compound is Bremelanotide, a synthetic hormone, that targets the melanocortin receptor in the hypothalamus, which plays a role in maintaining a healthy weight as well as arousal"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 7976, ""end"": 8135, ""text"": ""hat was until it Theranos, a much-hyped biotech start-up, announced what seemed like quantum leap in advancing one of the medical industry’s most vital tools."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 8339, ""end"": 8544, ""text"": ""the firm’s highly-secretive breakthrough technique for screening for a wide multitude of infections and conditions using a single drop of blood — and at a fraction of the cost of conventional laboratories."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 9073, ""end"": 9246, ""text"": ""t Columbia University in New York, a team of researchers announced in June that they had developed a DNA-based blood test that can detect every virus a person has ever had."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 8907, ""end"": 9071, ""text"": ""And just earlier this month, search giant Google was spotted filing a patent for a smartwatch that collected blood samples using a similar pressure-based technology"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	429	2023-04-03T22:45:54.349804Z	2023-04-03T22:45:54.349937Z	1043.138
Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week, we’re talking about human genetic engineering. George Church is professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and stakeholder in various human genetics companies, including Veritas, Editas and Intellia. His laboratory was the first to edit DNA with CRISPR in human stem cells. Major policy decisions are often impacted by gut feelings. One of the more exceptional technologies affected by public emotion has been genetic modification. Genetically modified “golden rice,” for example, emerged in 2002 as a potential global health solution to a vitamin A deficiency that kills a million people each year, but vandalism of field trials has contributed to the delay of rice research, which already faces technical obstacles. [Other perspectives: Why are we telling scientists to destroy human life?] The communication between emotions and facts is even more crucial as we begin to discuss human genetic engineering as a tool for disease treatment. It is urgent that citizens around the world inform themselves and participate in this rapidly moving set of decisions. What we decide will change all our lives, and there are a few important questions to consider: 1. Can embryos consent? There are more than 2,000 gene therapy human clinical trials in progress. Some must happen at early stages of growth — during child development, for example, to cure blindness. But early interventions, such as with fetal surgeries and medicines, involve risk without consent of the child, so the benefits for the child and society must also be considered. Ironically, doing nothing can entail the biggest risks. For example, delaying retinal gene therapy can result in children who can see light patterns but never learn to interpret faces. 2. Will genetic engineering permanently change our society? Gene therapies are typically done to cure individuals, not alter subsequent generations. But for each such therapy, if effective, the genetic changes will nevertheless be present in future children due to widespread use. This is cultural, not genetic, inheritance — as occurs with other compelling technological innovations, such as cars and phones. Indeed, “cultural inheritance” can spread far more rapidly, in a matter of months rather than over a period of 25 years in generational time. Gene therapies developed to prevent cognitive decline at age 60, for example, could be found to enhance certain skills on Wall Street at age 20 and could enter common use within years. 3. Where do we draw the line? Going forward, developing ethical and policy boundaries on genetic engineering will demand nuance. The lines around our current genetic engineering practices should not be based on categories of technology (genetic therapy vs. genetic counseling, for example), because most categories can contain both good and bad outcomes. Instead, the lines should be drawn based on the outcomes themselves and safety and efficacy, as they are for all new technologies. We should also design our policies to take into account more factors than just the severity of the disorder a genetic treatment attempts to address. If our medical industry approved treatments based on severity alone, we would be missing out on a variety of valuable treatments for seemingly simple maladies such as headaches, sleepiness, insomnia, acne and allergies. 4. Can we reduce risk to embryos? Parents who carry the genetic variation for certain serious inherited diseases (like Tay Sachs) but are themselves unaffected are currently able to avoid passing on the disease to their children by using prenatal testing during pregnancy (or more rarely in vitro “pre-implantation”). This, however, risks the abortion of embryos inherent in the choosing process, which is unacceptable to many parents. An alternative could be to edit sperm-producing cells in the father so that only non-carrier sperm are produced, eliminating the possibility of the disease showing up in embryos. Half of the children will still be carriers – due to the genes being passed on from the mother, so this would not affect the gene pool. 5. Will there be genetic consequences further down the line? The error rate of well-designed CRISPR technology is much lower than normal mutation rates in unmodified DNA, and inspecting modified sperm stem cells can reduce this rate an additional million-fold. But even if genetic effects are initially undetectable, environmental and/or social effects may become evident after many generations. We already monitor many modern discoveries for long-term effects, and tools such as CRISPR should not be an exception. As soon as we discover harm that outweighs benefit, we try to fix it. Yet cars still kill millions of people worldwide each year. Cigarettes were initially approved by health experts and sold in the trillions between 1930 and 2000, ditto for BPA from 1957 to 2008 and DDT from 1940 to 1962. More recently, the painkiller Vioxx was banned after it was shown to cause heart attacks and strokes — but only after 80 million people used it. 6. Will it exacerbate wealth inequality? Commentators have long suggested that genetic engineering will be available only to those who can afford it, resulting in wealth disparities and allowing its advantages to accrue only to a small percentage of society. This risk can be reduced by distributing the high cost of the technology’s development throughout society, as the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, passed to incentivize the development of drugs for rare diseases, meant to accomplish. The cost may also fall on its own, as has happened with electronic technology and genome sequencing. It’s also noteworthy that CRISPR and gene drive technology may provide a path to eliminating malaria or nematode diseases — saving millions of lives per year and breaking cycles of disease, poverty and illiteracy. 7. Are some traits just too complex? Not necessarily. Usually even when studies of complex genetic traits do not reveal single gene variants with large impacts in the body, they can be found via rare natural variants or synthetic biology. Indeed, the most successful therapies target a single gene product in the midst of a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. For example, while hundreds of common genetic variants add tiny effects on height, one gene product (growth hormone) outweighs all of those and is used medically. Similarly, single gene variants have been shown to significantly enhance cognitive tasks in animals. These are being tested for Alzheimer’s disease therapies. As with other therapies, side effects — if any — can be explored and fixed. 8. Are we seeking the ideal human? If so, the idea makes as little sense as seeking out “the ideal transportation”: how do we decide among jets, cars and oil tankers? Lessons of history and evolution show we need diversity, and not just in skin melanin densities. We need immunological, metabolic, cultural and mental diversity — including people with high-functioning autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, dyslexia and narcolepsy. I have mild forms of some of these “disorders” and feel we are not ready to lose them. If you’re in need of convincing, just Google each of those six pejorative terms along with “successful” or “famous.” Indeed, the Israeli military elite unit 9900 embraces autistic skills at interpreting aerial photographs. To prevent such loss, and to adapt to the world of the future, we need public support for such neural diversity. Physics and chemistry have led to leaps in the diversity of our cultural artifacts. Genetics can too. Explore these other perspectives: Robert Gebelhoff: What’s the difference between genetic engineering and eugenics?

"“Imagine your printer like a refrigerator that is full of all the ingredients you might require to make any dish in Jamie Oliver's new book,” chemist Lee Cronin says in a 2012 TedGlobal talk. Cronin, a professor at the University of Glasgow, goes on to describe how this idea could be applied to drugs, such as ibuprofen, by enabling a 3-D printer to follow a recipe given by a pharmaceutical company and produce whatever is needed, on the fly from a set of chemical inks. Think of it as a ""Star Trek"" replicator for pills. [The future of health care, now in 3-D] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a major step toward that vision on Monday when it approved the country's first prescription drug made through 3-D printing. Created by Aprecia Pharmaceuticals, the drug -- called Spritam -- is a dissolvable tablet used to treat certain types of seizures in adults and children with epilepsy. The technology will allow the company to tailor each dose individually -- no measuring or splitting involved. Doctors are already using customized, 3-D printing to create implants for patients with injuries and are exploring a wide range of other applications, such as printing human tissue and even whole organs. Three years ago, for example, one newborn received a 3-D-printed splint to keep his airway from collapsing.

"Ian Burkhart was only 19 when the accident happened. He had been swimming in the Outer Banks with some buddies when a wave caught him and hurled him into a sandbar, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down. But he always held out hope that medical science would one day be able to help him regain enough movement to become more independent. That day has finally arrived. Scientists reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that they have been able to implant a chip in Burkhart's brain that sends signals to an array of 130 electrodes embedded in a ""sleeve"" he wears on his arm that has given him the ability to move his hand with significant accuracy. Holding a glass of water and pouring it out. Using a stick to stir the contents of a jar. Playing Guitar Hero. Swiping a credit card. These are the movements of mundane, daily life that many of us take for granted. But for Burkhart it's nothing short of a miracle. ""The first time I was able to open and close my hands it really gave me a sense of hope for the future,"" Burkhart, now 24,  said in a call with reporters. Lead researchers Chad Bouton, Nick Annetta and Ali Rezai said the effort took a multi-disciplinary team of scientists from neurosurgery to electrical engineering. The technique they used involves reconnecting the brain to the body by bypassing the damaged spinal cord. For the interface to work, Burkhart concentrates on the movement he wants to make and  a computer connected to the chip translates those signals into something his muscles understand. It turns out that each person has his or her own unique language that makes the machine a kind of ""interpreter."" The study marks the first time a paralyzed patient has been able to regain movement in his own body — a total of six different wrist and hand motions — by using signals that originated within the brain. ""We were not sure this would be possible. This result really exceeded our expectations,"" said Bouton, a researcher at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y. Burkhart tested and fine-tuned the system during up to three sessions a week for 15 months after the operation that implanted the chip in his brain’s motor cortex region. The surgery was led by Rezai, director of the Center for Neuromodulation at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. When the doctors first broached the procedure and experiment, he was hesitant. “It was something I certainly had to consider for quite a bit of time,” he recalled. But in the end, Burkhart said, he felt the risk was worth it because of the technology’s potential for improving his daily quality of life. “For me being in a wheelchair and not being able to walk is not the biggest thing.” Rather, “it’s the lack of independence” that comes from not being able to use his hands. “I have to rely on so many people for things.”   The breakthrough is one of a number of recent advances in brain-computer interfaces for paralysis. In December 2012, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh helped Jan Scheuermann, who is quadriplegic, grab chocolate and put it to her mouth with a robotic appendage. Others have been experimenting with similar treatments for people with Lou Gehrig's disease and stroke. Throughout the world, millions of people are living with full or partial paralysis, and the achievement marks what scientists say may be a new era in the types of treatment available to them. While the interface can only be used in the lab at this time, Annetta, an electrical engineer at the Ohio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, said their immediate goals include miniaturizing the equipment and making it more practical for patients so they can use it in their homes or out and about in their communities. ""This opens up so many opportunities now that we know it’s possible,"" Bouton said.

"Diabetes is a data-intensive disease. For those living with diabetes, managing their condition involves never-ending calculations: How much insulin to take to keep blood sugar in a targeted range, how many grams of carbohydrate are in a sandwich, or how an average monthly blood sugar reading fluctuates with different levels of exercise. But unlike the math problems in school textbooks, there is often no clear answer to these questions. Given the numerous and complex factors that affect blood sugar – including food, physical activity, and sleep patterns – it’s not always clear what exactly occurs between a good blood sugar reading and a bad one. To many Americans, this is an important question. Nearly 30 million Americans had diabetes in 2014, according to CDC estimates, though more than a quarter of them were undiagnosed. Another 80 million Americans were classified as “pre-diabetic,” meaning they will likely develop diabetes in the next decade if they don’t change their lifestyles. (Around 5-10 percent of these cases are Type 1 diabetes, in which a person’s body doesn’t produce insulin, and a person must take insulin to survive. The rest are Type 2 diabetes, sometimes called adult onset diabetes, in which a person gradually loses the ability to produce sufficient quantities of insulin.) In many counties in the U.S., more than 10 percent of the population has been diagnosed as diabetic, as this map shows: Because it is so widespread, diabetes is incredibly expensive, costing the U.S. $176 billion in direct medical bills and $69 billion in indirect costs, including disability, work loss and premature death, in 2012. Diabetes can’t be cured; it can only be treated. The goal is to keep blood sugar within a certain healthy range: If it dips too low, a person can faint or go into a diabetic coma. But too-high blood sugar results in wear and tear on the body that can lead to eye, nerve or kidney complications. “It’s math all day long,” says Jeff Dachis, the founder of a new app for managing diabetes and a person living with Type 1 diabetes. “If I take too much insulin, I can die instantly, and if I take too little insulin over time, I’ll just die slowly. But if I stay in range, I can stay considerably healthy and unimpacted by diabetes.” The widespread adoption of wearable health devices is diminishing some of this mathematical mystery. Many Americans are now using products like the Google Fit platform, the Apple HealthKit, or Fitbit to track their sleep, exercise and calories. And a coming wave of wearable technology and social media and mobile apps promises to transform how people live with and manage diabetes. Diabetics had to painstakingly measure the sugar levels in their urine until the early 1980s, when the first glucose monitors were introduced for home use. (""My first One Touch meter was almost the size of a lunch box,"" writes internet user coravh, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1966.) Today, most people with diabetes test their blood sugar with glucose meters, then administer insulin through an injection or an insulin pump, a device that sits under the skin and provides a continuous or programmed dose of insulin. Technology companies are developing more innovative devices to continuously test blood sugar and provide readings and alerts, even while someone is exercising or sleeping. Abbot, Dexcom and Medtronic have developed continuous glucose monitors, which constantly measure blood sugar levels through a small sensor that is inserted under the skin, providing a lot more insight into how a good reading turns into a bad one. The devices still have drawbacks: They are expensive and only partially covered by insurance, if they are covered at all. And the FDA still recommends checking the readings against a glucose meter. The next big technological step is an ""artificial pancreas,"" an implantable device which would monitor blood sugar as well as automatically deliver insulin. Researchers are developing small implants that can do both, eliminating the need for daily finger pricks and injections. Companies are also developing less invasive ways to measure blood sugar. For example, Google and Novartis AG are partnering to develop a contact lens that monitors glucose contained in tears and transmits the data through a tiny antenna. But these high-tech devices will be expensive, and may not be commercially available for years. In the meantime, diabetics may be able to learn a lot more about their condition by organizing and sharing their data. Dachis, the co-founder of digital marketing firm Razorfish, helped develop a new diabetes app that launched in the Apple App Store on Tuesday. Called One Drop, the free app includes a digital glucometer, tracking features, social sharing and food logging. The app combines glucose, food, insulin and physical activity in a simple relational data display, and allows people with diabetes to share and learn from other people around them, says Dachis. Dachis says the app is an example of the emerging practice of ""data-driven self-care."" With doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies more focused on procedure-based sick care, he argues that data-driven self-care has an important role to play in keeping people well. ""The health care industry has been one of the last to digitally transform, and more importantly it’s been one of the last to participate in the democratization of the tools of self-expression that the mobile phone has enabled for people,"" he says. Dachis is emphatic that One Drop will never share personal, identifiable data with someone outside the community, for example for marketing purposes. But he is hopeful about the potential that the data, stripped of ways to identify individuals, holds for diabetes research. ""With a large-enough population base, you’ll start to see wildly relevant correlations or causality between all different kinds of behavior,"" he said. ""We can start to collect and analyze and correlate that to clinical trial study data or published research data and start to extract the insights for people who are struggling and trying to navigate from moment to moment."""	417	"[{""start"": 1939, ""end"": 2070, ""text"": ""It’s math all day long,” says Jeff Dachis, the founder of a new app for managing diabetes and a person living with Type 1 diabetes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2272, ""end"": 2515, ""text"": ""he widespread adoption of wearable health devices is diminishing some of this mathematical mystery.

Scientists have successfully edited the DNA of human embryos to erase a heritable heart condition that is known for causing sudden death in young competitive athletes, cracking open the doors to a controversial new era in medicine. This is the first time gene editing on human embryos has been conducted in the United States. Researchers said in interviews this week that they consider their work very basic. The embryos were allowed to grow for only a few days, and there was never any intention to implant them to create a pregnancy. But they also acknowledged that they will continue to move forward with the science, with the ultimate goal of being able to “correct” disease-causing genes in embryos that will develop into babies. News of the remarkable experiment began to circulate last week, but details became public Wednesday with a paper in the journal Nature. The experiment is the latest example of how the laboratory tool known as CRISPR (or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a type of “molecular scissors,” is pushing the boundaries of our ability to manipulate life, and it has been received with both excitement and horror. The most recent work is particularly sensitive because it involves changes to the germ line — that is, genes that could be passed on to future generations. The United States forbids the use of federal funds for embryo research, and the Food and Drug Administration is prohibited from considering any clinical trials involving genetic modifications that can be inherited. A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in February urged caution in applying CRISPR to human germ-line editing but laid out conditions by which research should continue. The new study abides by those recommendations. Shoukhrat Mitalipov, one of the lead authors of the paper and a researcher at Oregon Health & Science University, said that he is conscious of the need for a larger ethical and legal discussion about genetic modification of humans but that his team's work is justified because it involves “correcting” genes rather than changing them. “Really we didn’t edit anything. Neither did we modify anything,” Mitalipov said. “Our program is toward correcting mutant genes.” Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who is co-chair of the National Academies committee that looked at gene editing, said that concerns about the work that have been circulating in recent days are overblown. “What this represents is a fascinating, important and rather impressive incremental step toward learning how to edit embryos safely and precisely,” she said. However, “no matter what anybody says, this is not the dawn of the era of the designer baby.” She said that characteristics that some parents might desire, such as intelligence and athleticism, are influenced by multiple genes and that researchers don't understand all the components of how such characteristics are inherited, much less have the ability to redesign them. The research involved eggs from 12 healthy female donors and sperm from a male volunteer who carries the MYBPC3 gene, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. HCM is a disease that causes an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle but can cause no symptoms and remain undetected until it causes sudden cardiac death. There's no way to prevent or cure it, and it affects 1 in 500 people worldwide. Around the time the sperm was injected into the eggs, researchers snipped out the gene that causes the disease. The result was far more successful than the researchers expected: As the embryo's cells began to divide and multiply, a huge number appeared to be repairing themselves by using the normal, non-mutated copy of the gene from the women's genetic material. In all, they saw that about 72 percent were corrected, a very high number. Researchers also noticed that there didn't seem to be any “off-target” changes in the DNA, which has been a major safety concern of gene-editing research. Mitalipov said he hoped the technique could one day be applied to a wide variety of genetic diseases and that one of the team's next targets may be the BRCA gene mutation, which is associated with breast cancer. The first published work involving human embryos, reported in 2015, was done in China and targeted a gene that leads to the blood disorder beta thalassemia. But those embryos were abnormal and nonviable, and there were far fewer than the number used in the U.S. study. Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a researcher at the Salk Institute who is also a co-author on the new study, said that there are many advantages to treating an embryo rather than a child or an adult. When dealing with an embryo in its earliest stages, only a few cells are involved, while in a more mature human being there are trillions of cells in the body and potentially millions that must be corrected to eradicate traces of a disease. Izpisua Belmonte said that even if the technology is perfected, it could deal with only a small subset of human diseases. “I don’t want to be negative with our own discoveries, but it is important to inform the public of what this means,” he said. “In my opinion the percentage of people that would benefit from this at the current way the world is rather small.” For the process to make a difference, the child would have to be born through in vitro fertilization or IVF and the parents would have to know the child has the gene for a disease to get it changed. But the vast majority of children are conceived the natural way, and this correction technology would not work in utero. For years, some policymakers, historians and scientists have been calling for a voluntary moratorium on the modification of the DNA of human reproductive cells. The most prominent expression of concern came in the form of a 2015 letter signed by CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna, Nobel Laureate David Baltimore and 16 other prominent scientists. They warned that eliminating a genetic disease could have unintended consequences — on human genetics, society and even the environment — far into the future. On Wednesday, Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society, warned that the O.H.S.U. research would result in fertility clinics offering “ ‘genetic upgrades’ to those able to afford them.” “Once those commercial dynamics kick in, we could all too easily find ourselves in a world where some people’s children are considered biologically superior to the rest of us,” she said in a statement. “We need to ask ourselves whether we want to add that new kind of excuse for extreme social disparities to the ones we already tolerate.” Researchers who worked on the heart-condition experiment appear to have differing views on where their work is headed. Paula Amato, a reproductive endocrinologist with O.H.S.U., was excited about the idea of being able to edit out diseases before birth. She said that while pre-implantation genetic screening of embryos is now available, it isn't perfect. She talked about how one of her patients went through three cycles of in vitro fertilization but all the eggs that were harvested had the gene mutation that causes diseases. With gene correction technology, Amato said, “we could have rescued some of those embryos.” But Izpisua Belmonte said he is focusing on using the findings from this study to further research into gene modifications during a pregnancy or after birth into adulthood. “I feel that the practical thing to do is deal with the diseases people have, not with the disease they may have,” he said. Mitalipov said he hopes regulators will provide more guidance on what should or should not be allowed. Otherwise, he said, “this technology will be shifted to unregulated areas, which shouldn’t be happening.” This story has been updated.

"Get ready for some incomprehensibly big numbers. Scientists are predicting that genomics — the field of sequencing human DNA — will soon take the lead as the biggest data beast in the world, eventually creating more digital information than astronomy, particle physics and even popular Internet sites like YouTube. The claim, published Tuesday in a PLOS Biology study, is a testament to the awesome complexity of the human genome, but it also illustrates a pressing challenge for the 15-year-old field. As genomics expands at an exponential rate, finding the digital space to store and manage all of the data is a major hurdle for the industry. [The rumors were true: Scientists edited the genomes of human embryos for the first time] Michael Schatz, co-author of the study and a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, called the data challenge one of the most important questions facing biology today. ""Scientists are really shocked at how far genomics has come,"" Schatz said. ""Big data scientists in astronomy and particle physics thought genomics had a trivial amount of data. But we're catching up and probably going to surpass them."" [Worm spends four years burrowing through man’s brain (but at least we’ve sequenced its genome)] To give some idea as to the amount of data we're talking about, consider YouTube, which generates the most data of any source per year — around 100 petabytes, according to the study. A petabyte is a quadrillion (that's 10 followed by 15 zeroes) bytes, or about 1,000 times the average storage on a personal computer. Right now, all of the human data generated through genomics — including around 250,000 sequences — takes up about a fourth of the size of YouTube's yearly data production. If the data were combined with all the extra information that comes with sequencing genomes and recorded on typical 4-gigabyte DVDs, Schatz said the result would be a stack about half a mile high. [If you could print out the whole Internet, how many pages would it be?] But the field is just getting started. Scientists are expecting as many as 1 billion people to have their genomes sequenced by 2025. The amount of data being produced in genomics daily is doubling every seven months, so within the next decade, genomics is looking at generating somewhere between 2 and 40 exabytes a year. A exabyte — just try to wrap your mind around this — is 1,000 petabytes, or about 1 million times the amount that can be stored on a home computer. In other words, that aforementioned stack of DVDs would easily start reaching into space. [The triumph of genomic medicine is just beginning] The study gives a good illustration of how the microscopic details of human genetics rival the complexity of the far-reaching science of the universe. The mountain of data used to analyze human DNA is so large that Schatz jokes people will eventually have to substitute the term ""astronomical"" with a more appropriate word: ""genomical."" ""With all of this information, something new is going to emerge,"" he said. ""It might show patterns of how mutations affect different diseases."" IBM's Watson Genomics initiative, for example, is crunching data on the entire genomes of tumors, with the hope of generating personalized medicine for cancer patients. [Personalized cancer vaccines have already helped treat three patients] At some point, scientists might be able to save space by not storing sequences in full, similar to the way data is managed in particle physics, where information is read and filtered while it is generated. But at this point, the study says, such data cropping isn't as practical because it's hard to figure out what future data physicians will need for their research — especially when looking at broader human populations. Right now, most genome research teams store their data through on-site hard drive infrastructure. The New York Genome Center, for example, is generating somewhere between 10 to 3o terabytes of data a day and storing it in an on-site system. They move old data they don't regularly use to cheaper and slower storage. ""At this point, we're continuously expanding file storage,"" said Toby Bloom, deputy scientific director at the center. ""The biggest hurdle is keeping track of what we have and finding what we need."" Organizations like Bloom's are eyeing the possibility of moving the data to cloud storage, but she said that's currently not as cost effective as expanding their physical storage infrastructure. But size is not the only problem the field faces. Biological data is being collected from many places and in many different formats. Unlike Internet data, which is formatted relatively uniformly, the diverse sets of genomic data makes it difficult for people to use them across datasets, the study says. Companies like Amazon and Google are developing the infrastructure to put genomic data on public clouds, which would be especially helpful for smaller centers with limited IT staff, but could also help foster collaboration. Google recently announced a partnership with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard aimed at providing its cloud services for scientists combined with a toolkit developed by the institute that can be used to analyze the data. The concept is to put a bunch of the world's genomic data on Google's servers, where scientists from all over can collaborate on a single platform. ""It's extremely likely to see (the cloud model) going forward,"" Schatz said. ""It just makes more sense."" Read More: Scientists just made the first map of the human epigenome.

What I’m doing is creating a dashboard for my body.” Once, Smarr was most renowned as the head of the research lab where Marc Andreessen developed the Web browser in the early 1990s. Now 66, Smarr is the unlikely hero of a global movement among ordinary people to “quantify” themselves using wearable fitness gadgets, medical equipment, headcams, traditional lab tests and homemade contraptions, all with the goal of finding ways to optimize their bodies and minds to live longer, healthier lives — and perhaps to discover some important truth about themselves and their purpose in life. <!-- ////// Newsletter know-how ////// This code should not be simply copy and pasted into other projects.

The explosion in extreme tracking is part of a digital revolution in health care led by the tech visionaries who created Apple, Google, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems. Using the chips, database and algorithms that powered the information revolution of the past few decades, these new billionaires now are attempting to rebuild, regenerate and reprogram the human body. In the aggregate data being gathered by millions of personal tracking devices are patterns that may reveal what in the diet, exercise regimen and environment contributes to disease. Could physical activity patterns be used to not only track individuals’ cardiac health but also to inform decisions about where to place a public park and improve walkability? Could trackers find cancer clusters or contaminated waterways? A pilot project in Louisville, for example, uses inhalers with special sensors to pinpoint asthma “hot spots” in the city. “As we have more and more sophisticated wearables that can continuously measure things ranging from your physical activity to your stress levels to your emotional state, we can begin to cross-correlate and understand how each aspect of our life consciously and unconsciously impacts one another,” Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun and investor in mobile health start-ups, said in an interview. The idea that data is a turnkey to self-discovery is not new. More than 200 years ago, Benjamin Franklin was tracking 13 personal virtues in a daily journal to develop his moral character. The ubiquity of cheap technology and an attendant plethora of apps now allow a growing number of Americans to track the minutiae of their lives as never before. James Norris, in his 30s and an entrepreneur in Oakland, Calif., has spent the past 15 years tracking, mapping and analyzing his “firsts” — from his first kiss to the first time he saw fireworks at the Mall. Laurie Frick, 59, an Austin artist, is turning her sleep and movement patterns into colorful visualizations made of laser-cut paper and wood. <!-- Do not re-use this code.

More than 30,300 people are following his life on Twitter. Most extreme are “life loggers,” who wear cameras 24/7 , jot down every new idea and record their daily activities in exacting detail. Their goal is to create a collection of information that is an extension of their own memories. Even President Obama is wearing a new Fitbit Surge, which monitors heart rate, sleep and location, on his left wrist, as a March photograph revealed. Tech firms are eagerly responding to the human penchant for self-perfectability by inventing more devices that can collect even more data, which the tech titans foresee as the real gold mine. At the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in January, new gizmos on display included a baby bottle that measures nutritional intake, a band that measures how high you jump and “smart” clothing connected to smoke detectors. Google is working on a smart contact lens that can continuously measure a person’s glucose levels in his tears. The Apple Watch has a heart-rate sensor and quantifies when you move, exercise or stand. The company also has filed a patent to upgrade its earbuds to measure blood oxygen and temperature. In the near future, companies hope to augment those trackers with new ones that will measure from the inside out — using chips that are ingestible or float in the bloodstream. Some physicians, academics and ethicists criticize the utility of tracking as prime evidence of the narcissism of the technological age — and one that raises serious questions about the accuracy and privacy of the health data collected, who owns it and how it should be used. There are also worries about the implications of the proliferation of devices for broader surveillance by the government, such as what happened with cellphone providers and the National Security Agency. Critics point to the brouhaha in 2011, when some owners of Fitbit exercise sensors noticed that their sexual activity — including information about the duration of an episode and whether it was “passive, light effort” or “active and vigorous” — was being publicly shared by default. They worry that wearables will be used as “black boxes” for a person’s body in legal matters. Three years ago, after a San Francisco cyclist struck and killed a 71-year-old pedestrian, prosecutors obtained his data from Strava, a GPS-enabled fitness tracker, to show he had been speeding and blew through several stop signs before the accident. More recently, a Calgary law firm is trying to use Fitbit data as evidence of injuries a client sustained in a car crash. More sophisticated tools in development, such as a smartphone app that analyzes a bipolar person’s voice to predict a manic episode, and injectables and implants that test the blood, offer greater medical benefit but also pose greater risks. Des Spence, a general practitioner in the United Kingdom, argues that unnecessary monitoring is creating in­cred­ible anxiety among today’s “unhealthily health-obsessed” trackers. “Health and fitness have become the new social currency, spawning a ‘worried well’ generation,” he wrote in an opinion piece in the April issue of BMJ, the former British Medical Journal. “Getting the data is much easier than making it useful,” said Deborah Estrin, a professor of computer science and public health at Cornell University. Constantly measuring heart rate may be helpful for someone heavily involved in sports or someone at risk of a heart attack. “But it’s unclear how important and meaningful it is for the everyday person,” she said. After all, Estrin and other experts argue, Homo sapiens has survived for about 130,000  years without such technology because the human body already has a number of alarm systems built into it. Any mother who has been woken in the wee hours by a crying child knows that a gentle press of the back of the wrist to a forehead is fast, free and eerily accurate in diagnosing a fever. .img-promo { background-image: url('http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/05/quantify-promov3.jpg'); background-size: 100%; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding: 12%; } .aging-promo-hed { font-family: FranklinITCProThin, Arial; font-size: 275%; color: #07b5bc; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 100%; text-align: center; } .aging-promo { font-family: FranklinITCProThin, Arial; font-size: 200%; color: #808080; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 140%; text-align: center; } a { color: #07b5bc; } @media (max-width: 767px) { .img-promo { display: none; } } What kind of fitness tracker are you?

We are here to help. Click here to take our quiz. Social sharing Until about three years ago, it was nearly impossible for ordinary people to get a readout about the state of their bodies on a regular basis. Now dozens of biosensing wearable technologies with names such as the Fitbit Surge, Misfit Shine and Jawbone UP have exploited the miniaturization of computer components and the ubiquity of cellphones to create an industry that is expected to reach $50 billion in sales by 2018, according to an estimate by Credit Suisse. The research firm Gartner forecasts that 68.1 million wearable devices will be shipped this year. A growing percentage are being purchased by employers including Bates College and IBM as perks for their workers. A survey by Nielsen last year indicated that 61 percent of those aware of wearable technology for tracking and monitoring medical conditions use fitness bands. The technology is inherently social. Many users share their body metrics with friends, family and even co-workers as readily as they would pictures from their travels to distant countries or their late-night bar adventures. “When I talk to my parents, they are paranoid about their health data being stolen, but it doesn’t bother me,” said Halle Tecco, the 31-year-old co-founder and managing director of Rock Health. The digital health seed fund in San Francisco is funding a number of next-generation wearables and monitors, such as a software program that assesses Alzheimer’s risk by analyzing eye movements with a cellphone camera and a band being tested as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder that analyzes skin responses. Mollie McDowell, 26, marketing manager at Rock Health, openly talks online about how she has had a pain in her right hip for years and has tried several iPhone apps to try to find the cause and to track her mood and menstrual cycle. “I think there is a lot of insight you can learn about yourself this way,” she said in an interview. In late April, she tweeted to the world, “Found out I’m Vitamin D deficient.” Daniel Gartenberg, organizer of the Washington, D.C.-based meetups for Quantified Self, an international group of more than 29,000 self-trackers, has written several apps that helped track his own sleep that he has made available to the public. “I had mild insomnia,” said the doctoral candidate in applied cognition at George Mason University, “but have hacked it away.” This openness extends to the citizen-scientists’ willingness to share information for the greater good. Thirty-four percent of health trackers share their data or notes with someone else, according to a Pew Research Center study. In March, when Apple announced its ResearchKit initiative to allow people to share their information with researchers working on projects in asthma, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer and Parkinson’s through various apps, more than 41,000 people volunteered within the first five days. It’s unclear whether young adults’ open attitude toward sharing their data will remain when the next generation of more invasive biotrackers becomes commonplace. Ginger.io, which was developed by data scientists from MIT, has created an app that can alert a provider if something is “off” — signaling the possibility of depression or a manic episode — based on how much a patient moves around or how many people they talk to that day so that counseling or other intervention can be offered. Silicon Valley-based Proteus Digital Health has gained regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for an ingestible chip the size of a grain of sand that can be embedded in a pill. When the pill is swallowed, the chip sends a signal that’s logged on to central servers that you — or a loved one or doctor — can access on your phone or desktop. Video: Using Fitbit to help kids lose weight Play Video Researchers in St. Petersburg, Fla., are conducting a study to determine whether using Fitbit activity trackers and other technology can help teens lose weight. (Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post) The life sciences unit of Google X, the search company’s secretive research lab, is working on building a nano-size particle that will travel in the bloodstream. The particles would circulate throughout the body and attach to particular types of cells, such as cancer cells, or to enzymes given off by plaque in the arteries before they are about to rupture or cause a heart attack or stroke. If the particles found questionable cells or enzymes, they would send a signal to a device worn outside the body that would transmit the information to the patient or to a physician. The innovation is outpacing the scientific and legal framework for testing and regulating such devices. The Food and Drug Administration in January indicated it would regulate devices that are invasive but take a lighter touch on wearables. According to the agency’s draft guidelines, a wellness product crosses into the territory of a medical device, which requires a rigorous FDA review that is expensive for manufacturers, when its intended use refers to a specific disease or condition, or it presents an inherent risk to a user’s safety. That would essentially leave hundreds, if not thousands, of “low-risk general wellness” products — a category that presumably applies to the current incarnation of Fitbits — free from extra scrutiny under federal food and drug safety laws. They would still be subject to monitoring by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has the power to recall products to protect the public against unreasonable risks from injuries or death from consumer products. In 2014, after thousands of users complained of skin irritations from Fitbit bands, the CPSC worked with the company on a recall that affected more than 1 million devices. How the data that is generated from the devices is protected and shared is also murky. Federal patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act don’t apply to most of the information the gadgets are tracking. Unless the data is being used by a physician to treat a patient, the companies that help track a person’s information aren’t bound by the same confidentiality, notification and security requirements as a doctor’s office or hospital. That means the data could theoretically be made available for sale to marketers, released under subpoena in legal cases with fewer constraints — and eventually worth billions to private companies that might not make the huge data sets free and open to publicly funded researchers. “The mythology in this country is you can do whatever you want to your body, and a doctor will give you a pill to fix it. That needs to change,” says Larry Smarr, a computer scientist at the University of California at San Diego. He tracks his biometric data, seen on charts behind him. (Earnie Grafton for The Washington Post) The data of a life Larry Smarr’s journey into the data of his life began when he moved to California in 2000. “I had spent 28 years in the heartland of the obesity epidemic in Illinois. I had gained a lot of weight and wasn’t exercising. I got to La Jolla and looked around and said, ‘Oh, my God, if I don’t get with the program, they are going to send me back,’ ” he recalled. Smarr came to California as a computer science professor to head a $400 million multidisciplinary research institute for the University of California that has been called the West Coast equivalent of MIT’s famous Media Lab. Composed of scientists, artists and technologists, Calit2 (or the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology) aims to rapidly develop prototypes of technological innovations and test them in the real world. Embracing the institute’s multidisciplinary philosophy, Smarr took a scientist’s approach to investigating himself. Although he had no previous experience in medicine, nutrition or biochemistry, he trained himself, he said, by reading more than 600 journal articles on monitoring and health. .aging-quote p { font-family: FranklinITCProThin, Arial; /*font-family: ""PostoniDisplay"",Georgia,Times,serif;*/ color: #2a2a2a; font-size: 376%; position: relative; text-align: left; background-color: white; line-height: 140%; /*display: inline-block;*/ text-rendering: optimizeLegibility !important; /*padding-left: 18px;*/ } .aging-quote p::first-line { color: #07b5bc; } .aging-quote p + p::first-line { color: #000; } .aging-quote p + p { font-size: 140%; font-family: FranklinITCProLight, Arial; line-height: 145%; text-indent: 2px; } .aging-quote b { font-family: FranklinITCProBold, Arial; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #808080; } @media (max-width: 767px) { .aging-quote p { font-size: 275%; } } “As we have more and more sophisticated wearables ... we can begin to cross correlate and understand how each aspect of our life consciously and unconsciously impacts one another.” Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun and investor in mobile health startups. Click here to read a Q&A with Khosla. He measured his way to lifestyle change: No coffee after 10 a.m., because he tested how long the effects lasted after his last drop; 40 minutes on the elliptical, because that was how long it took for him to reach his optimal heart rate; new vitamin supplements every few months, as dictated by his evaluation of his blood work. “We are in a once-a-century period of discovery about the human organism,” Smarr said. Quoting science-fiction author William Gibson, he said “the future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” Smarr’s mantra is that these devices and tests will help people take personal responsibility for their own health. And an increasing body of behavioral medical research has found that patients who track their diet, physical activity and weight achieve better results than those who don’t, suggesting that wearable monitors provide feedback that reinforces personal accountability. “The mythology in this country is you can do whatever you want to your body, and a doctor will give you a pill to fix it. That needs to change,” Smarr said. Few people may be willing to go as far as Smarr. In 2009, when blood tests showed he was secreting excessive amounts of something called C-reactive protein, a substance found in blood plasma that is a marker of inflammation, he took the results to his internist: “There’s something terrible going on.” The doctor asked how he felt. “Fine,” said Smarr, and so the doctor laughed and sent him home, he recalled. “This is when I began to realize there is a disconnect between science and medicine,” said Smarr, who countered by writing down how he was feeling in a diary. “I realized I could data-mine this information,” he said, on a spreadsheet with a scale for the severity of issue. He was surprised at all the things he had dismissed as minor: blurriness and stinging in his eyes for a short while — “like you touched jalapeño,” arthritis, swelling in his belly. The record-keeping didn’t yield a diagnosis, so in 2011 he decided to try to identify the organisms in several months of stool samples. With more than 90 percent of the cells in the human body made up of other organisms, the idea of keeping one’s “microbiome” healthy was just taking off; Smarr was curious about how that applied to him. “You are an ecology, and the health of those bugs determine how you are,” he said. .quiz-promo-hed { font-family: FranklinITCProThin, Arial; font-size: 275%; color: #07b5bc; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 100%; text-align: left; } .quiz-promo { font-family: FranklinITCProThin, Arial; font-size: 200%; color: #808080; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 140%; text-align: left; } a { color: #07b5bc; } Can you make it to 100 years or beyond?

He looked at all his data and had a eureka moment: He had Crohn’s, an inflammatory bowel disease. Last year, Smarr ventured farther in his quest for self-discovery. He got an MRI of his abdomen and used a 3-D printer to create a model of his own colon. But that didn’t lead to any new insights, and the model is now a paperweight on his desk. One weekday afternoon in his lab, Smarr studied his life on an 18-by-8-foot monitor that spans most of the room. On the board were 150 key variables about his body over a 10-year period, displayed in colored rectangles. Most were green, meaning they fall within the expected, healthy range. But some were yellow (one to 10 times outside the healthy range), and a handful were red (10 to 100 times outside the healthy range). According to the custom-built “future patient” program built by coders at the research center Smarr oversees, the scientist’s body was still in attack mode for some reason. It has been nearly three years since Smarr discovered the issue, and he’s tens of thousands of metrics down the road, but he has yet to find a way to treat it. “People overestimate what knowledge can do for you,” he said with a shrug.

Welcome to 2012 and a new list of New Year’s resolutions — a list that likely includes some variation on adopting a healthier lifestyle. Thanks to the acceleration of technology, fulfilling your resolutions this time around may be easier than it was in 2011. The combination of diet, exercise and sleep, according to my Singularity University colleague Daniel Kraft, are keys to good health. Kraft, a physician-scientist who chairs the medicine track and runs the FutureMed program at Singularity, believes that we can end the obesity epidemic and reduce the incidence of “non-communicable” diseases (such as heart disease) through technology. Kraft helped me put together an assessment of the technologies available today that can help you fulfill your New Year’s resolutions for good health. 1. The Digital Mirror: A written commitment is a powerful tool when it comes to motivation. That power is enhanced when the commitment, and our failure or success in achieving it, is shared with others. Today, we can broadcast our weight, whereabouts, current song selections, and our latest meal over social media. You’re more likely to maintain your motivation to lose weight when you know your friends can see your gains and losses on an easy-to-read graph. There more than 17,000 health and fitness applications in the Android and iTunes marketplaces. Exercise applications such as RunKeeper enable seamless pacing, tracking and scoring of workouts. My favorite when I go hiking is MotionX GPS—in addition to keeping track of how much and how fast I’ve walked, it remembers where I’ve been. Others like Skimble provide tracking and virtual coaches from a large library of workouts. There are apps for tracking your dietary indiscretions or to brag about your veggie intake. For example, The Eatery, enables you to crowd-source the healthiness of your meals. And for helping you count calories, there’s LoseIt—which claims that the average user loses 12 pounds. 2. Self-Tracking Devices: Logging in and recording data points have long been a barrier to self-tracking. Consider this barrier all but eliminated. Web-connected scales like Withings, and blood pressure cuffs like iHealth, communicate with your smartphone and Web browser, recording your data with every use. They can also be configured to share your vital stats via e-mail or Twitter. For those who need to track blood sugars, the FDA just approved iBGStar, a glucometer integrated with the iPhone. 3. Move it or Lose it: The most effective therapy for depression, poor sleep, arthritic knees, heart disease, prevention of Alzheimer’s and many other disorders is exercise. As little as 30 minutes of active walking per day can make a massive difference in your health and longevity. Wearable devices like the ‘FitBit’, which I use and which constantly motivates me to walk more, JawBone’s ‘Up’, and the pending ‘Basis’ heart rate and motion monitor, track the number of steps you take, calories you burn, and miles you walk. These devices provide dashboards, connect to your social networks and allow you to set goals and targets. Company divisions or work groups can leverage the social component to foster friendly competition. Meanwhile, new start-ups are emergingto engage and reward those who do. 4. Enhance the power of sleep: The power of a good night’s sleep is often under-appreciated. It’s all about quality and duration. Applications, resting under your pillow, can track your motion at night and help you develop better habits. By using the Zeo Sleep Manager, I was able to notice a significant difference in the quality of my sleep on days that I was checking e-mails after 9 PM, and when I turned my computer off early. Devices like Zeo and Lark bring much of the power of an expensive sleep lab to your home, and can help identify signs of diseases such as sleep apnea. 5. Genomes come home: We have seen the pricing of genomic sequencing continue to plummet at more than double the rate of Moore’s Law. It doesn’t take a complete DNA sequence to make use of one’s own genetic makeup. Consumer-focused companies such as 23andMe, Navigenics, and Pathway Genomics now offer partial genomic analysis (not a full sequence) for about $200—the cost of a high end pair of shoes. While the “fun” side of ancestry and family background can be illuminating, several aspects of genetic predisposition can be actionable. Knowing, for example, that a relative has twice the risk of developing Type-II diabetes or a significantly higher propensity of developing cardiovascular disease may provide the necessary encouragement to stay in shape, modify your diet, or engage in earlier screening and prevention. 6. In Case of Emergency: Quick reference tools such as iTriage help enable rapid response, whether it’s finding and obtaining guidance on treating a minor burn or directions to the nearest hospital. They can, ultimately, be the difference between life and death. And in-case-of-emergency applications are improving on the traditional medical bracelet. These applications store essential information about you and provide emergency contact numbers. 7. Gamification: Anyone who has been addicted to a video game, or knows someone who has, can appreciate the power of immersion and interaction. Video-game developers are marrying physical and social activity, giving players an opportunity to exercise and socialize while they play. And web-based applications like HealthMonth are getting in on the game as well. 8. Mindfulness: Our attention spans have been keeping pace with technology in that they are getting shorter as technology is getting faster. The benefits of almost any form of mindfulness or meditation practice are well documented. And, as with nearly everything else, there’s more than one app to help you through it. Hopefully, with a bit of help from technology, you will fare better at keeping your New Year’s resolutions than in previous years. The really good news is that this is just the beginning. Over the next few years, we will see thousands of new devices and technologies that will help you monitor and improve your health.	413	"[{""start"": 392, ""end"": 642, ""text"": ""Kraft, a physician-scientist who chairs the medicine track and runs the FutureMed program at Singularity, believes that we can end the obesity epidemic and reduce the incidence of “non-communicable” diseases (such as heart disease) through technology"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 797, ""end"": 885, ""text"": ""The Digital Mirror: A written commitment is a powerful tool when it comes to motivation."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1255, ""end"": 1348, ""text"": ""here more than 17,000 health and fitness applications in the Android and iTunes marketplaces"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1350, ""end"": 1446, ""text"": ""Exercise applications such as RunKeeper enable seamless pacing, tracking and scoring of workouts"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1448, ""end"": 1588, ""text"": ""y favorite when I go hiking is MotionX GPS—in addition to keeping track of how much and how fast I’ve walked, it remembers where I’ve been."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1589, ""end"": 1678, ""text"": ""Others like Skimble provide tracking and virtual coaches from a large library of workouts"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1680, ""end"": 1957, ""text"": ""There are apps for tracking your dietary indiscretions or to brag about your veggie intake.

Mark Zuckerberg recently announced a donation of $25 million to the Centers for Disease Control Foundationto help fight Ebola.  He noted that the Ebola epidemic has infected 8,400 people so far and could infect one million people or more if not addressed immediately. Zuckerberg’s involvement is an important step forward for the technology industry, and with a bit of luck, this disaster will be averted. But it is a prelude to a future in which humanity is so tightly connected that local epidemics break out frequently and spread globally within hours — and become pandemics. In addition to old diseases such as Ebola, there will be new, human inventions.  Advances in biological engineering are making it possible to create deadly new viruses and to modify and weaponize exiting pathogens. It isn’t just governments and terrorists who will do this; high-school children may inadvertently perform the wrong synthetic biology experiment. Students are already building biological systems and operating them in living cells. We need to be prepared for this scary future, and Silicon Valley needs to take the lead in developing technologies to track, prevent and manage pandemics. It also needs to work with scientists to develop cures. It now has the ability to do all this. Advancing technologies are surely creating new risks, but at the same time they are making it possible for entrepreneurs to do what only governments and big research labs could do before: solve global problems. Here are some of the technologies that entrepreneurs can build — and that we need to accelerate. 1. Patient identification and tracking systems. Just as marketers are using social media, mobile-phone logs, and search data to keep track of people and send them targeted advertisements, technology can be developed to track the spread of disease and identify patients. It can keep track of who was in contact with whom, ask how they are doing, and monitor their movement. 2. Education and communication. Mobile apps can help guide public-health measures, educate patients, and provide guidance to caregivers on prevention and cure. Billions of people worldwide now have cell phones. Soon they will have Internet-connected smartphones that can display video and run artificial intelligence–based apps.  Just as the XPRIZE Foundation launched a $15 million prize for a digital tutor that can educate a child — without a teacher — to read, write and perform arithmetic, so can Silicon Valley create technologies that provide accurate and timely information to people who are closest to the front lines of pandemics. 3. Better and faster detection. Sensors and microfluidic-based devices can facilitate the rapid testing of disease at the point of care.  Orasure Technologies, for example, has rapid diagnostic tests to screen for HIV and HCV and is currently exploring the feasibility of developing one for Ebola as well. BioFire Diagnostics and Nanologix are adapting their existing blood and respiratory products to test for infectious disease. These companies will benefit from an emergency-use authorization that the FDA recently issued which allows them to test their technologies in the field. Nanobiosym is developing one of the most promising technologies of all — a product called Gene-Radar, a portable nanotechnology platform that can rapidly and accurately detect genetic fingerprints from any biological organism. Anita Goel, Nanobiosym founder and chief executive, believes that technologies such as this will provide the best hope for addressing global pandemics. 4. Big data analysis. Just as airlines mine travel data to predict which flights are going to be full and to set airfares, data scientists can mine travel, epidemic, and passenger-load data to determine the probability of a passenger’s being a disease carrier.  If we know that flight X has Y percent of passengers from affected countries in West Africa, for example, we can use these data to better predict the spread of the epidemic and to determine where to focus efforts at containment, prevention, and treatment. http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/world/africa/who-says-ebola-vaccine-trials-could-start-in-january/2014/10/21/1b2845a7-d24e-4a55-adc2-239a4a16de7f_video.html Entrepreneurs can also develop technologies for disease treatment, and synthetic vaccines may be the key. One Silicon Valley company, Flow Pharma, is developing a biodegradable, microsphere-based vaccine-delivery platform, for example. Its co-founder, Naveen Jain, explained to me that when the vaccine is combined with adjuvants (chemicals that exaggerate an immune response), the human body treats microspheres as an infectious disease and enables them to deliver a payload to the human immune system. It can also educate the immune system to fight targets that it cannot identify on its own.  The payload will be biological markers from a virus that weaken it. For Ebola, research has already been done on 1,200 biological markers.  Flow Pharma is using machine learning software to determine which of these biological markers best identify the virus’s Achilles heel. Jain says that he expect this analysis to be complete in two weeks.  He believes that they can develop a non-sterile vaccine prototype in less than 60 days and be ready for human tests within a year. This is optimistic thinking, for sure.  But it represents the kind of effort that we need from hundreds of Silicon Valley start-ups. In the technology industry, success is a numbers game, and optimism rules the day.  Many start-ups address the same problems using different approaches. They take big risks and learn from one another. The companies that succeed in solving the problems of pandemics will surely reap the large financial returns that Silicon Valley looks for. But the social returns will be far greater. It is about saving humanity, after all.	412	"[{""start"": 268, ""end"": 405, ""text"": ""Zuckerberg’s involvement is an important step forward for the technology industry, and with a bit of luck, this disaster will be averted."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 268, ""end"": 405, ""text"": ""Zuckerberg’s involvement is an important step forward for the technology industry, and with a bit of luck, this disaster will be averted."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1586, ""end"": 1955, ""text"": ""Patient identification and tracking systems.

In a significant advance toward creating the first “designer” complex cell, scientists say they are one-third of the way to synthesizing the complete genome of baker's yeast. In seven studies published Thursday in the journal Science, the researchers describe how they built six of the 16 chromosomes required for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, altering the genetic material to edit out some genes and write in new characteristics. “A lot of synthetic biology is motivated by this idea that … you only understand something when you can build it,” said Johns Hopkins computational biologist Joel Bader, one of the leaders of the project. “Well, now we know enough about biological systems that we can design a chromosome on a computer, synthesize it in a laboratory, put it in the cell, and it will work.” Scientists have built designer cells in the past. In 2010, scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute created a bacterial cell controlled by a synthesized genome by copying the DNA of one bacterium into another. Last year they took the effort a step further by building the first “minimal cell,” an organism never found in nature that had the smallest number of genes required for life. Several months later, a team led by researchers at Harvard Medical School successfully re-engineered a small fraction of the genes of the bacterium E. coli. This isn't the first time scientists have written genetic code for yeast. Jef Boeke, director of New York University Langone’s Institute for Systems Genetics and an organizer of the project, and his colleagues synthesized their first chromosome in 2014. They dubbed their project Sc2.0 (“Sc” stands for S. cerevisiae). The new papers, however, signal an important advance. The chromosomes generated this time represent the largest amount of genetic material ever synthesized, and the new Sc2.0 cells are substantially different from their natural, or “wild type,” relatives. “In addition to building the thing, we’ve really added new features to chromosomes that weren't there before,” said Boeke. Among the most significant of these new features is a program the scientists called “SCRaMbLE,” or “Synthetic Chromosome Recombination and Modification by LoxP-mediated Evolution” (scientists are congenitally disposed toward convoluted acronyms). The program allows scientists to rearrange elements within the genome to generate new and potentially useful permutations. Whereas many of Boeke's peers labor for years in the lab trying to genetically modify organisms, the SCRaMbLE system “lets the yeast do the work and lets the yeast teach us new biology,” Boeke said. It's like a version of the lottery in which you can continuously and instantaneously roll new numbers until you get a result you want.  Other innovations in the Sc2.0 genome include the removal of duplicate bits of genetic code and the addition of short genetic sequences that distinguish synthetic chromosomes from their natural counterparts. “By rebuilding chromosomes, these teams are showing that biology can be remade such that it is easier to measure, model and manipulate,” said Andrew Endy, a professor of bioengineering at Stanford University who was not involved in the project. Endy noted that evolution doesn't necessarily favor biological systems that are easy to understand; scientists have been analyzing the human genome for 25 years and still aren't really sure how a lot of it works. If researchers can engineer simpler cells — ones whose DNA the scientists wrote themselves — they will have an easier time harnessing those systems for research, medicine and industry. Unlike other synthetic organisms, the engineered yeast is a eukaryote — a complex cell with diverse internal structures, just like the cells in the human body. It has more genetic material than the bacteria synthesized by the Venter Institute and Harvard projects. Yeast is among the most well-studied organisms on Earth, a staple of biology labs, making it extremely useful for research. And it has myriad industrial, medical and scientific applications, from the production of biofuels to the development of vaccines. The Sc2.0 team plans to add a 17th chromosome to the designer cell to improve its protein-making machinery. Incidentally, S. cerevisiae is the same yeast that bakers use to make bread. Some of the undergraduates working on the Sc2.0 project crafted a gene that would cause the yeast to produce beta carotene, the molecule that gives carrots their vitamin A and orange coloring, and baked a loaf with it. The bread came out of the oven with a lovely orange color, but Boeke wouldn't let them eat it. (They didn't have approval from their Institutional Review Board, which oversees research safety and ethics.) Culinary misadventures aside, the new papers illustrate “a major milestone,” said Huimin Zhao, a synthetic biologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Though the Sc2.0 team still has several chromosomes left to generate, the new research provides proof of concept for future genome synthesis projects, and the system has become radically more efficient. It took nearly 10 years for the researchers to build their first chromosome — even though they were working on the shortest one in the yeast's genome. But they needed less than three years to generate the next five chromosomes, which include some of the genome's longest, and Boeke said the team will complete the full genome by the end of next year. Though the process has gotten faster, each synthesized chromosome still requires a herculean effort on the part of more than 100 collaborators working across three continents. The blueprints for the chromosomes are written via a computer program and then analyzed by biologists to see if they will work. These are then broken into short, manageable segments and shipped off to commercial DNA synthesis labs. The short chunks are then stitched together using a technique developed by Boeke and undergraduate students who took his “build-a-genome” course at Johns Hopkins, and then injected into the cell. The compliant yeast cells make it easy to swap in the fabricated material for the DNA that's already there. And in many cases the new genetic material has no effect on the organisms' growth. The data for the entire Sc2.0 project is open-source, so anyone can borrow from or contribute to the research. “This is a progress report, it is not a final product,” said Harvard geneticist George Church, who led the research on engineered E. coli. “But the fact that there are so many teams involved indicates this is a generalizable and adoptable strategy. It's not a one-off stunt.”  Church speculated that scientists could be heading toward “a post-CRISPR world,” in which, instead of using the heralded gene editing technology to modify chromosomes, scientists will simply synthesize entire new ones. “We’re seeing something that goes far beyond editing,” he said.  Church and Boeke are organizers of the Genome Project-write, an heir to the Human Genome Project that aims to develop the tools needed to engineer and test genomes on a large scale, dramatically reducing the cost of such efforts. The initiative drew criticism from many in the scientific community when it was formally launched last year. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health and an organizer of the earlier Human Genome Project, told The Washington Post at the time that “whole-genome, whole-organism synthesis projects extend far beyond current scientific capabilities, and immediately raise numerous ethical and philosophical red flags.” Endy of Stanford also urged caution: “Do we wish to be operating in a world where people are capable of organizing themselves to make human genomes? Should we pause and reflect on that question before we launch into doing it?” he told The Post. “They’re talking about making real the capacity to make the thing that defines humanity — the human genome.” Boeke acknowledged that there are serious ethical considerations to be made when it comes to synthesizing the genomes of humans and even other animals. But he doesn't worry too much about the safety profile of Sc2.0. “Let's say for the sake of argument there could be the yeast that ate Manhattan,” he said. “If such a yeast could arise in nature it probably already would have.” In other words, nature has had billions of years to perfect the process of synthesizing genomes. Humans may have crafted a handful of sequences for a few single-cell organisms, but if our dreams — and our nightmares — involve someday mastering evolution, we've still got a long way to go.

"The new life is born with a jolt: A fresh genome, built from scratch with human hands, is pushed into a host cell using an electric current. One cell quickly becomes a colony of a billion, and a completely unique living organism is alive. It's not science fiction — or even a recent breakthrough. Scientists created the first synthetic bacterium back in 2010 using this method. But in a new study published Thursday in Science, they've taken this proof of concept a step further. Their latest single-cell creation has what they're calling a ""minimal genome."" They've created an organism that has just 473 genes, the smallest known genome of any living organism. With fewer, it wouldn't be able to sustain itself. Their hope is that bringing a genome down to its minimum components will help scientists figure out the most basic building blocks of life. As it stands, even this minimal genome has many genes with unknown purposes. The work is led by J. Craig Venter and Clyde Hutchison, both of the J. Craig Venter Institute. Together with the rest of their research team, Venter and Hutchison have been working to understand the basic components of the genome for more than 20 years. Venter is known for leading private-sector efforts to sequence the human genome for the first time, in addition to booting up the first ""synthetic life"" in 2010. But creating a ""minimal genome"" has been a long-term goal. ""We knew we could boot up a virus from our synthetic DNA, but nobody had ever transplanted a microbial genome, specifically one made from scratch with four bottles of chemicals,"" Venter told The Washington Post. ""So [the 2010 paper] was the control experiment to see if any of this was possible."" ""We used most of the genome sequence of a known species, so it had a reasonable chance of working,"" he said. Even then, it took years to get right: When scientists sequence a genome, they're able to accept one error in a thousand genes or so, but to build a DNA code that will support life, you need to be pretty much error-free. ""Once we knew that worked, we could really start from scratch,"" he said. Venter and his colleagues wanted to create a cell that had only the genes absolutely necessary to support life. More and more organisms are getting their genomes sequenced, but the purpose of all the data contained in our genetic codes remains largely mysterious. By getting back to basics, they reasoned, scientists might stand a chance of actually understanding the purpose of every single gene in a living cell. The group used existing literature to create several close-to-minimal genomes, then knocked out different genes until they came to the smallest that still allowed the cell to live and replicate itself. In doing so, they found that many genes thought to be nonessential to life were actually one-half of gene pairs with the same function. One of those genes might appear nonessential on its own — like a jet engine that could be shut down without causing the plane to crash — but if its buddy was also taken away, the cell would die. Those kinds of tricky redundancies are what make studying the core genes of life so difficult. But even their pared-down synthetic cell — dubbed JCVI-syn3.0 — has a whopping one-third of its genes totally unaccounted for. ""There were 149 genes of unknown function. We expected maybe 5 or 10 percent. I don’t think anyone would have imagined getting down to a minimal cell with 32 percent,"" Venter said. Even with a cell that can barely support itself, it seems, the task of hunting out gene function will still be daunting. Venter is hopeful that other labs will step up to the plate. ""There could be labs out there who have already sequenced a similar gene and the protein associated with it and worked on its function, but haven't published yet,"" he said. ""Maybe there are even studies out there that have been published in obscure journals that we haven't seen. In any case, we might quickly resolve a lot of these."" Other labs may even go on to create yet smaller genomes. ""It says a minimal bacterial genome, not the minimal,"" Venter said during a news conference held by Science on Wednesday. For one thing, this is a minimal genome for one particular kind of bacterial cell. If someone tried to make a new yeast cell with a minimal genome, for example, the result would be very different. Venter and his team also made the choice not to knock out quite as many genes as were possible, strictly speaking, because they needed JCVI-syn3.0 to replicate quickly enough for practical lab use. ""You have to define what life is going to mean each time,"" Venter told The Post. In this case, life meant a bacterial cell that could grow rapidly in a glucose culture. If speed hadn't been a priority, they could have trimmed the genome down a bit smaller. And if they'd wanted the cell to survive in conditions less sweet than a petri dish, they would have needed to give it a bigger genomic arsenal. ""As soon as you want the cell to adapt to some environmental stress, it might not do it with the genes it has, it might just die,"" he said. In an email to The Post, Harvard University professor George Church, who wasn't involved in the new paper, called it ""a solid study worthy of celebration"" but pointed out that gene editing using the CRISPR method is also coming along rapidly. It's likely that editing will be more practical than building from scratch in many instances. But Venter's institute has a lot of lofty goals for their synthetic biology techniques. They're working on the prototype of a device that sends digital translations of DNA across the globe, allowing for a sort of 3-D printer that spits out tailor-made vaccines, proteins and microbes on demand. He has suggested that missions to Mars might send home the genomes of any microbes found on the Red Planet, allowing scientists on Earth to create aliens in the lab before our astronauts even come home. Unsurprisingly, the far-flung science fiction-like applications of Venter's work have caused outcry in the past, prompting visions of out-of-control Franken-microbes. The researchers hope to see tailor-made microbes built for new applications in medicine, biofuels and agriculture. But for now, they have more basic science in mind. ""We want to understand every component in a living cell,"" Venter said. ""We're just trying to understand the basic components of life."" This post was originally published on March 24th.

Researchers have released the most complete mapping of the human epigenome to date, using massive data analysis to understand how and why certain genes turn off and on in human cells. Their work, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, could lead to new treatments for a multitude of diseases, including cancer. But what the heck's an epigenome? Over a decade ago, the efforts of the Human Genome Project gave us a complete road map of the genes that make up human DNA. But there's more to your genes than just which ones are present: The human genome is the musical score of human existence, but the human epigenome is the conductor. Without knowing what's going on with the epigenome, we can't really know how the music is going to sound. So it's not hard to understand why the epigenome is so much trickier to pin down. Your DNA is essentially the same line of code in every single cell in your body, but not all of your cells perform the same jobs. Cells come together to build tissues as different from each other as muscle and bone, even though they all technically have the same genes inside them. The intricate and minute choices that your cells make about which genes to express are what we call the epigenome, and this can be influenced by basically anything: Where your mother lived while pregnant with you, what kind of food you're eating, and even what kinds of pollutants your grandparents were exposed to as children. To create a better picture of these switches, researchers led by MIT professor Manolis Kellis analyzed a total of 150 billion genome sequencing reads. Using a specially developed algorithm, they crunched this massive data set to look for epigenomic changes in 111 different cell types. “Different combinations of epigenetic marks characterize different regions of the genome, reflecting the specific functions that they play in each cell,” Kellis said in a statement. “By studying these combinations systematically, we can learn the language of the epigenome, and what it is telling us about both the activity and the function of each genomic region in each of the cell types.” In one of the studies published Wednesday, the researchers tied specific cell changes to 58 different biological traits. Sometimes the epigenomic changes of a cell reveal possible clues about disease. For one example, Kellis told The Verge, they found mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease changing the genomic activity of immune cells -- not just brain cells. This was found in a mouse model, not a human, so it might not apply to us. But if it does, it could give researchers new areas to target when they try to treat the disease.	409	"[{""start"": 1587, ""end"": 1720, ""text"": ""Using a specially developed algorithm, they crunched this massive data set to look for epigenomic changes in 111 different cell types"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1587, ""end"": 1720, ""text"": ""Using a specially developed algorithm, they crunched this massive data set to look for epigenomic changes in 111 different cell types"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	417	2023-04-03T12:17:37.802324Z	2023-04-03T12:17:37.802394Z	161.483
"2015 has been a great year for scientific discovery -- and an especially great year for space exploration. Here are some of the highlights: 1. Pluto   In my opinion, Pluto really stole the show this year. It was early in 2015 that the New Horizons spacecraft, which launched nearly a decade ago, started sending back its first images of the distant dwarf planet. Soon those images were the best we'd ever seen of Pluto -- though they were still blurry dots of light. By the time summer rolled around, we had near-constant updates from the mission, with every set of photos blowing the previously captured images out of the water. That's bound to happen when you're speeding towards a never-before-visited object at around 31,000 mph. The year is wrapping up with the end of the Pluto imagery chapter: NASA has just started releasing the most highly resolved images taken during the July 14  Pluto flyby. It's likely that these pictures are the best we'll ever see. That doesn't mean that New Horizons is over. The spacecraft has 16 months worth of data to send back to Earth, which means mission scientists still have about a year of new information to look forward to. And it's likely that the mission will be extended to observe an even more mysterious object -- 1 billion miles closer to the edge of our solar system -- that New Horizons will reach on Jan. 1, 2019. The Pluto flyby was a gorgeous moment of global excitement over science. I was so into it I got a tattoo to commemorate the occasion. Sure, people can argue over whether or not Pluto deserves its designation as a ""dwarf planet,"" but I think that misses the point: The complexity of Pluto -- which rivals that of ""real"" planets like Mars -- goes to show us that our galaxy is bursting with things we don't understand. Heck, our solar system is bursting with those things. 2. Misc. space Sorry, other space news. You're just no match for Pluto. But 2015 had a lot of exciting stuff: Tons of new exoplanets were found by Kepler, a space telescope that should have been put out of commission by a hardware failure ages ago. The dwarf planet Ceres teased us for months with a smattering of mysterious bright spots. Scientists found evidence of water on Mars right now, and evidence that the water that used to be there was plentiful and long-lasting -- perhaps so much so that life could have evolved there. We also found a pretty good explanation for why all that water vanished. [What water on Mars can teach us about scientific ‘breakthroughs’] And oh, that hunt for life. In April, NASA's top scientist declared that he believed we'd find signs of life within the next decade. It's no wonder, because 2015 was a really good year for ocean worlds, with Saturn's moon Enceladus revealing a potentially habitable inner-ocean and NASA putting a mission to the ocean-filled Europa in motion. The Cassini probe, a wildly successful robot zipping around Saturn and its moons, even took a dip in some of the geysers jetting out of Enceladus's icy surface. Early reports suggest that the chemistry of the water could support life, and we'll know more once the data has been properly analyzed. Some folks even got optimistic about the hunt for intelligent life this year. Stephen Hawking stamped his name on a $100 million hunt for intelligent aliens, and scientists expressed (very) cautious optimism that a strange flickering star might be a sign of an alien civilization. It totally isn't, according to the research that followed, but it was a nice thought. Meanwhile, NASA sent an astronaut on a year-long mission to monitor the effects of long-term spaceflight -- while his identical twin, a retired astronaut, stayed home for comparison. 3. The microbial explosion Let's pivot right from big things to small things: 2015 was an excellent year for research on bacteria. The microbiome is so hot right now. We learned that the hygiene hypothesis -- which suggests that kids should be exposed to diverse germs early on -- is probably pretty well-founded, so get your baby to a farm (or at least let them play on the floor of a subway car). Scientists revealed that our microbial signatures are stunningly unique, and might even be able to serve as a sort of fingerprint. We also learned a lot about what those microbes can do, especially when it comes to, well, doo doo. As we reported back in January, the Fecal Matter Transplant industry is booming. More and more evidence suggests that a healthy gut microbiome can be transferred by way of a poop transplant, and that the magic happens even when you use frozen, benign pills instead of invasive colonoscopies to seed your new bacterial kingdom. And yes, you can get paid (a lot) for your poop. Just bear in mind that it's easier to get accepted to MIT than it is to get accepted as a fecal donor. But no, your beard probably isn't full of poop. Probably. And let's not let bacteria hog the microbial spotlight: This year a team of scientists figured out how to trick yeast into turning sugar into hydrocodone. Home-brewed heroin, anyone? 4. The brave new world of gene editing  This year, rumors started circulating that a team of Chinese scientists had edited the human genome for the first time -- and those rumors wound up being true. CRISPR, a cut-and-paste gene editing tool, has opened the floodgates for this stuff. While actually editing the genome of a viable human is probably pretty far off (the Chinese scientists had a pretty high error rate, and presumably wouldn't have gestated any of their edited embryos anyway for ethical reasons), I wouldn't be surprised if we saw CRISPR-customized pets within the next few years. And scientists are already working on editing animals so their organs are better suited for human transplant. And it's never too early to freak out about ethical quandaries: Just weeks ago, researchers met to discuss the potential ethical hurdles of human gene editing at a historic summit. Their conclusion? Well, humans have kind of been playing god for a long time, so in some ways this isn't new. But it's potentially dangerous, and we need to tread lightly. 5. Other good science things  Those are just our favorite sweeping topics, but a lot of other stuff happened this year -- and we wrote some fun things that we're proud of. Be sure to peruse the links above for more info on the greatest hits, but check out the links below for more reading material.

People in pain write to Jennifer Doudna. They have a congenital illness. Or they have a sick child. Or they carry the gene for Huntington’s disease or some other dreadful time bomb wired through every cell in their body. They know that Doudna helped invent an extraordinary new gene-editing technology, known as CRISPR. But they don’t all seek her help. One woman, the mother of a child with Down syndrome, explained: “I love my child and wouldn’t change him. There’s something about him that’s so special. He’s so loving in a way that’s unique to him. I wouldn’t change it.” The scientist tears up telling this story. “It makes you think hard about what it means to be human, doesn’t it?” she says. Doudna (pronounced DOWD-na) has been doing a lot of hard thinking lately as she ponders the consequences of CRISPR. The world of molecular bio­logy is mad for this new form of genetic engineering. Scientists have turned a natural bacterial defense system into a laboratory tool for cutting or reordering genes in a cell — an innovation that could be used to target genetic mutations linked to numerous diseases. CRISPR is not the first method for manipulating genes, but it’s by far the cheapest, easiest, most versatile. Its many attributes have generated incredible excitement as well as apprehension. While the approach hasn’t been applied yet in humans for therapeutic purposes, that’s on the horizon. So are worrisome scenarios involving genetic enhancements and purely cosmetic applications. The technology is still being honed. Two Harvard biochemists reported recently in Nature that they had found a way to target a single letter in a genome in the laboratory experiment. This is all happening with ­dizzying speed. CRISPR has spawned two contentious, parallel debates, with Doudna squarely in the middle of both. The first is the ethical issue raised by the mother of the child with Down syndrome: How far should we go in editing the human genome? The new technique potentially enables changes in the human “germline” cells, which could entail changes not only to a single person’s genome but also to that of any of the person’s descendants. Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. The second debate covers the tricky matter of who exactly invented CRISPR and thus should be awarded the patents. Big money is in the balance. Prestigious science institutions are doing battle with one another. Invective flies on social media. Message: Science is a business. Both issues are so prickly that it’s easy to overlook the way ­CRISPR has already changed how countless scientists do basic research. Thousands of them are using it to understand the genetic origins of diseases. This isn’t the future; this is now. Soon, CRISPR could lead to genetically modified plants that wind up in your grocery store. It already has been used to develop a mushroom that won’t turn brown as quickly, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture has decided doesn’t need regulatory approval because no genes from other organisms were required for its creation. Doudna is a party to the patent battle even as she’s among the most outspoken figures in the ethical debate. “It’s a bit of a crazy life right now,” she says. * * * The 52-year-old Doudna is highly conscious of being a woman in a ­male-dominated scientific profession. She never used to be, though. She kept her head down. She did her lab work. She published. She was promoted and lauded. But as she became more well known, and routinely cited as a possible winner of a Nobel Prize, she noticed all the glass ceilings above her and most women generally: “Seeing boardrooms that have no women in them. Seeing upper levels of administrations that have no or few women in them.” Doudna was born in the nation’s capital. Her father, a speechwriter for the Air Force, got the itch to become a professor of English and, after getting a doctorate at the University of Michigan, moved the family to the one place that offered him a job: the University of Hawaii at Hilo, on the Big Island. Young Jennifer never imagined being a scientist. In grade school she didn’t think she had any particular knack for it. But she did take interest in the natural world. “We had special kinds of toads that were only on our island. We had all kinds of plants that had evolved in this kind of environment. There were blind spiders that lived in lava tubes,” she recounted during a visit to Washington earlier this year. She asked herself: How did that happen? How did these things evolve? A 10th-grade chemistry teacher, Miss Wong, encouraged her. A vocational test told her she ought to go into civil engineering, whatever that meant. She still didn’t see herself as a scientist. “I had this impression from the media that science was for old white guys, people who looked like Einstein, that it wasn’t for people like me,” she said. At Pomona College, she studied biochemistry. Though doubtful of her prospects, she applied to Harvard Medical School. She got in and earned a doctorate in the lab of Jack Szostak, an eminent figure in origin-of-life research. Her path eventually led to her own laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. And then CRISPR came along. She didn’t invent CRISPR; bacteria did. It’s an amazingly nifty immune system that testifies to the innovations that emerge from Darwinian natural selection. In the genetic code of bacteria are repeated sequences that until recently were viewed as junk DNA. Scientists who studied them began to refer to them as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats — CRISPRs. Researchers gradually figured out that these sequences were akin to copies of DNA segments in viruses that had previously attacked the bacteria. At its core, life is built around information, and the humblest bacterium keeps a record of bad stuff that has previously come down the pike. The CRISPR system takes fast action. When a virus shows up, the system identifies the invader as familiar and then directs molecular machinery to slice up and disable it. How this natural system became leveraged by human beings as a laboratory tool is a controversial tale that is keeping patent lawyers busy. The narrative prominently features Doudna. She co-authored, with French scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier, a 2012 paper showing how the CRISPR system could be exploited to cut genes in a test tube and create a new method of gene editing. Soon after that breakthrough, a young scientist named Feng Zhang, of the Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, published a paper showing how CRISPR could be applied to mammalian cells. George M. Church, a flamboyant geneticist at Harvard Medical School, published a similar result at the same time. Perhaps inevitably, patent applications generated a tremendous battle, pitting not only Doudna and Charpentier against Zhang but also lofty institutions, notably UC Berkeley and Broad/MIT/Harvard, against one another. The two sides have tried to settle their fight, they revealed in an April 11 filing. But it could drag on for years. The scientists also have equity stakes in start-up companies that want to commercialize the CRISPR technology. Doudna, for example, is the co-founder of three — Caribou Biosciences, Intellia Therapeutics and Editas ­Medicine. There’s a lot of money flying around. Doudna and Charpentier each received a $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2015. They’ve been repeatedly mentioned as possible Nobel laureates — an honor that also comes with a seven-figure sum. But Zhang has a claim, as do Church and potentially many others. The Nobel, by rule, can go to no more than three people for any single discovery. Eric Lander, head of the Broad Institute, published a long, almost novelistic article titled “The Heroes of CRISPR” in January in the journal Cell. He dispersed credit for CRISPR widely, starting with an obscure Spanish scientist who first started looking at these palindromic repeats in the 1990s. A major kerfuffle ensued. The article carried no conflict-of-interest statement, because Lander didn’t have a personal financial stake in the ongoing patent fight. Critics howled that Lander’s review didn’t give Doudna and other scientists enough credit and was subtly slanted in favor of his colleague Zhang. Lander insisted he wasn’t trying to stiff anyone. But this is science today: People are edgy. Research is not just about the high-minded pursuit of knowledge. Breakthroughs are lucrative, and just about everyone has skin in the game. * * * In laboratories around the world, CRISPR has quickly become molecular biologists’ favorite tool. They can toy with genes in a mouse, for example, and see how a mutation can lead to a tumor. “I am absolutely confident that with CRISPR we are going to accelerate the rate at which we develop treatments that can control cancer, and cure some,” said Phillip Sharp, an MIT biologist and Nobel laureate. “It’s totally cool.” CRISPR offers the promise of someday being a great tool for gene therapy. But the scientists admit they’re not ready to do this yet. For starters, gene therapy has a troubled history. You make a mistake and the patient could die, which happened in the tragic case of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger in a clinical trial in 1999. The bigger concern comes with germline editing in human beings. If you knock out or modify a gene in a very young embryo, all the cells in that human being, including their reproductive cells (sperm and eggs), will carry the genetic modification. That then gets passed along to all descendants. If it happened just a few times, it would be unlikely to change humanity as we know it. But if done widely, it could change the species. Eliminating terrible diseases, such as Huntington’s, would seem a no-brainer. But most diseases and human traits have a complex genetic origin that’s hard to understand fully. In early 2014, Doudna read a paper detailing how researchers for the first time had manipulated the genomes in monkey ­embryos. She turned to her husband, a Berkeley professor of biochemistry, and asked, “How soon will it be until someone tries this in a human embryo?” Doudna found herself increasingly troubled. She had a particularly awful dream (first recounted in the New Yorker) in which a colleague wanted her to explain CRISPR to a man with a funny little mustache — a man she suddenly realized was Adolf ­Hitler. In early 2015, Doudna was among those pushing for boundaries on applications of CRISPR research. The scientific community realized it needed to come together in a manner similar to the famous 1975 conference at Asilomar State Beach in California that put restrictions on research using gene-splicing ­techniques. The 2015 version of Asilomar occurred at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington in December. For three days, sci­entists from Europe, China and North America discussed ­CRISPR. They talked about the history of eugenics. They heard from bioethicists. They considered the promises of the new technology. At the end, they hammered out guidelines, allowing research to go forward ­cautiously. The scientists said, for instance, that CRISPR should not be used to edit genes in human embryos intended to establish a pregnancy. They stressed that any tinkering with human germline cells should come only after a “broad societal consensus” that such editing is a good idea. Of course, a scientific agreement has no enforcing mechanism. Different countries have different laws. You can’t do ­CRISPR with a child’s chemistry set, but it also doesn’t require a massive laboratory. Asked how the world could stop the misuse of CRISPR, Doudna paused. “That’s a tough question,” she finally said. Then: “Let’s just take a step back for a second. Couldn’t we be having this discussion about any powerful technology?” Knowledge tends to be unidirectional, whether the subject is the secrets of the atom or the marvels of DNA. Scientific discoveries can be explosive. Doudna ultimately answers her own question: “You can’t unlearn it. You can’t put it away.”	407	"[{""start"": 816, ""end"": 1110, ""text"": ""he world of molecular bio­logy is mad for this new form of genetic engineering.

A National Institutes of Health advisory panel on Tuesday approved the first human use of the gene-editing technology CRISPR, for a study designed to target three types of cancer and funded by tech billionaire Sean Parker’s new cancer institute. The experiment, proposed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, would use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to modify patients’ own T cells to make them more effective in attacking melanoma, multiple myeloma and sarcoma. The federal Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee approved the Penn proposal unanimously, with one member abstaining. The experiment still must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates clinical trials. The early-stage trial, which will involve more than a dozen patients, will be designed to test the safety of the therapy. It will be conducted at three medical institutions — Penn, MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of California at San Francisco. The study involves T cells, which are white blood cells essential for ridding the body of bacteria, malignancies and other invaders. Carl June and other researchers at Penn have pioneered an immune therapy, called CAR T-cell treatment,  in which the cells are extracted from a patient, genetically engineered and then re-injected into the bloodstream. While the treatment shows promise, “our efforts have been hampered because the infused T cells become exhausted and die or cease to function,” the scientists said in explaining their proposal. Under the study approved Tuesday, CRISPR would be used to remove two genes in the T cells to make the treatment last longer and reduce the chance of the cancer’s returning. “Our goal is to develop a new type of immunotherapy using gene-editing technology that will enable the engineered immune cells to be more potent, survive longer and thereby kill cancer cells more effectively,” the scientists said. Jeff Bluestone, president and chief executive of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said in a statement, “We’re excited to be part of the first clinical effort in the United States to combine these two powerful therapeutic approaches to treat a devastating disease like cancer.” In April, Parker announced a $250 million effort to bring together researchers specializing in cancer immunology at institutions across the country. More than 300 scientists working at 40 labs in six institutions — Stanford, the University of California at San Francisco, UCLA, Penn, MD Anderson Cancer Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center — have already signed on. In a blog post last week, an NIH official hinted at the risk and rewards of using CRISPR to fight cancer. “Researchers in the field of gene transfer are excited by the potential of utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 to repair or delete mutations that are involved in numerous human diseases in less time and at a lower cost than earlier gene editing systems,” said Carrie Wolinetz, associate director of science policy at NIH. “While the application of new gene editing technologies in this field has great potential to improve human health, it is not without concerns.” Read more: Cancer doctors urge greater use of HPV vaccine Biden unveils huge data-sharing project	406	"[{""start"": 2, ""end"": 244, ""text"": ""nal Institutes of Health advisory panel on Tuesday approved the first human use of the gene-editing technology CRISPR, for a study designed to target three types of cancer and funded by tech billionaire Sean Parker’s new cancer institute"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1678, ""end"": 2198, ""text"": ""Our goal is to develop a new type of immunotherapy using gene-editing technology that will enable the engineered immune cells to be more potent, survive longer and thereby kill cancer cells more effectively,” the scientists said.

"On Friday, the Obama administration announced a ""moonshot"" that focuses on our world's tiniest inhabitants. The National Microbiome Initiative (NMI) will dive into the microbes that live on, in and around us – providing a wave of funding and support for one of the hottest young scientific fields. ""Although new technologies have enabled exciting discoveries about the importance of microbiomes, scientists still lack the knowledge and tools to manage microbiomes in a manner that prevents dysfunction or restores healthy function,"" said a statement released by the White House. A growing body of evidence suggests that the microorganisms of our planet have a powerful influence on human health. Scientists are working to figure out which bacteria are tied to particular diseases – and which bacteria seem to be prevalent in and on the healthiest members of our species. Some illnesses, like the devastating gastrointestinal infection C. difficile, are already being treated with microbial hacks like Fecal Microbiota Transplants, which replace the ""bad"" bacteria of the infection with hardy microbes taken from a healthy donor's feces. But the NMI won't just focus on the bacteria and fungi that cling to human bodies – it will also support research on microbes that can be used in fuel production and food processing, microbes that contribute to the health and productiveness of soil, and microbes that cause harm to animal populations – like the algae blooms that are becoming increasingly common as ocean waters get warmer. Researchers will also look at the relationship between the built environment – our homes and offices – and the spread of genes that allow bacteria to resist antibiotic treatment. The announcement comes just months after a group of experts in the field published a proposal for such an initiative in the journal Science. Scientists wanted the support to rapidly improve technology – allowing them to better analyze the microbiome and manipulate it with more precision, which could help unlock the roles of individual bacterial species. ""Microbes live in essentially every habitat on Earth,"" Jo Handelsman, associate director for science at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said during Friday's announcement. In working with scientists from different fields – all of them focused on the microbiomes of different organisms and environments – she kept hearing the same questions and concerns. ""They were asking what a healthy microbiome is, and how do we know, whether it's the microbiome of an ocean site or the human body,"" she said. What makes these bacterial colonies unique from ones that live in similar habitats? Should we be striving for certain ideals? And if so, is it possible to make the kind of changes we desire? Now scientists will have the support they need to figure that out: The Energy Department, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Agriculture Department and NASA will provide a combined budget of over $121 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Over 100 private institutions, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, are also announcing funding support today and are expected to contribute a combined $400 million. In addition to collaboration among scientists and support for new technology, the initiative will include programs designed to get more folks on the microbial bandwagon. “The microbiome is so variable that the scientific community will never be able to sample every environment on earth,” Handelsman told the Atlantic magazine. But through the work of college students and citizen scientists, “we could have hundreds and thousands of people gathering data, and doing highly replicated experiments in different classrooms.” Louise Slaughter – the only microbiologist in Congress and a staunch supporter of the new initiative – expressed high hopes during Friday's announcement, saying she expected the technological hurdles to be cleared ""quickly and well"". ""We know [microbes are] there, but we don't know enough about what they do,"" she said. ""It's going to be like splitting the atom, I think.""

"Through genomic profiling of 259 men with prostate cancer, scientists have identified five groups of prostate cancer with distinct DNA signatures. The discovery represents a major advance as researchers can now begin trying to tailor therapies to those subtypes. The approach has worked well in breast cancer and helped millions avoid the unnecessary cost, pain and time spent on treatments that are destined to fail. [Obama touts ‘lifesaving’ potential of personalized medicine] Such work is the backbone of President Obama's $215 million precision medicine initiative announced in January, which aims to pioneer a new approach to how we treat disease by moving away from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to medicine to one that takes into account things like a person’s genetic makeup, or the genetic profile of a tumor. [A new way to study cancer and its treatments] The prostate cancer study, reported in EBioMedicine, used samples from 482 tumors from those men, who were part of studies in Cambridge, Britain, and Stockholm. The scientists identified 100 genes associated with prostate cancer, including 94 that had not been previously associated with the disease. Most importantly, they found that a small subset of the 100 genes predicted poor prognosis better than any other method that had been used in a clinic setting.

There are sweeping changes now taking place at the intersection of health care and Silicon Valley. If the first step was the embrace of digital health by big tech companies and the creation of new wearable devices for tracking fitness and health, then the next step could be the creation of a revolutionary new direct-to-consumer health care model. This would take advantage of cheap plastic dongles hooked into your smartphone that offer the type of diagnostic power once reserved for hospital laboratories. The latest development in this new direct-to-consumer health model is a new breakthrough from a team of biomedical engineering researchers at Columbia University in New York City that makes it possible to test for both HIV and syphilis in 15 minutes after hooking a plastic dongle into your smartphone’s headphone jack. You simply insert a pinprick of blood onto a disposable plastic collector, connect the plastic collector to a microfluidic chip used to analyze the sample and insert the chip with the blood sample into the dongle. Once you’ve logged into an app, your smartphone can start to determine the presence of HIV or syphilis in your blood and display the results on your smartphone’s screen 15 minutes later. More than its ease of use, the cost factor of the dongle is what makes it possible to speculate that this type of smartphone diagnostics could one day lead to a new direct-to-consumer model for health care. The equipment needed to perform a laboratory-quality HIV test can cost upwards of $18,450 apiece. Contrast that to the cost of a cheap plastic dongle, which costs an estimated $34 to make. That makes it possible to imagine a future where tests are faster, simpler and cheaper than anything available today. What makes the lab-on-a-smartphone so innovative is that, even though you’re significantly reducing cost, you’re not sacrificing power. The results delivered by the new device suggest that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory. Moreover, in a small field study in Rwanda, the team of researchers found that patient preference for the dongle was 97 percent compared to laboratory-based tests. According to Samuel K. Sia, the lead biomedical engineering researcher on the project, there are broad implications for the way we think about health care: “Coupling microfluidics with recent advances in consumer electronics can make certain lab-based diagnostics accessible to almost any population with access to smartphones. This kind of capability can transform how health care services are delivered around the world.” And there’s plenty more innovation where this came from. This month, 23andMe received FDA approval for the first time ever to market a direct-to-consumer genetic test. It’s an important first step in terms of delivering direct-to-consumer genetic testing, as 23andMe notes: “While this authorization is for a single carrier status test only, we are committed to returning health information to our US customers who don’t already have this information once more tests have been through this process and we have a more comprehensive product offering.” At some point in the future, you could theoretically receive health reports about your children by running a series of DNA tests at home. This “lab-on-a-chip” innovation fits into a broader trend that has been building momentum for more than five years. Harvard chemist George Whitesides, in a popular TED Talk in 2009, outlined his vision of “diagnostics for all,” in which the cost of all diagnostics could be brought down to zero by creating “a lab the size of a postage stamp.” Instead of taking something that’s very expensive and trying to bring it down to zero (the $18,000 machine) – you can start with something very simple (a cheap plastic dongle) and attempt to build in additional complexity and diagnostic ability. Interesting things happen when you start thinking in terms of bringing low-cost innovations from the developing world to developed world. Cost constraints become a positive, not a negative. Sia’s work suggests that similar tests screening for other diseases might be right around the corner. As Sia points out, “If you can start to bring core health services to the smartphone beyond just measuring the heart rate — like blood tests — then you’re going to start seeing a pretty fundamental shift in the health-care system.” Of course, it’s not certain that all this innovation is going to be coming to market anytime soon. In the United States, for example, there are obvious regulatory hurdles to get new health innovations to market. Just consider how much time and effort 23andMe has spent in getting its genetic tests to market. As a result, health-care dongles will probably be used in the field first for remote and mobile clinics in the developing world, before moving to the developed world. When it comes to diagnostics, though, “zero cost” is an admirable goal. Smartphone diagnostics is part of a mind-set shift about the way we offer and receive health care. Smartphones offer power, a simple user interface and mobility, all in the palm of your hand. Now that the average smartphone today has more processing power than NASA had when it put a man on the moon, it could just be a matter of finding the right mix of dongles and letting Moore’s Law take care of the rest when it comes to testing for disease.	402	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 245, ""text"": ""e are sweeping changes now taking place at the intersection of health care and Silicon Valley.

CHICAGO — Vice President Biden on Monday announced the launch of a first-of-its kind, open-access cancer database to allow researchers to better understand the disease and develop more effective treatments. The Genomic Data Commons, a part of the National Cancer Institute, contains the raw genomic and clinical data for 12,000 patients, with more records to come as researchers contribute to it, he said. Besides detailed analyses of the molecular makeup of cancers, the database has information on which treatments were used and how patients responded. Biden announced the GDC start in remarks to thousands of researchers, physicians and patient advocates at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting. Earlier in the day, he’d visited the University of Chicago, which is housing the database and will manage it for NCI. Biden told the cancer doctors that the database will encourage needed collaboration among scientists in different disciplines to ferret out important aspects of cancer and find new ways to help patients. The way research currently is conducted hinges on “the cult of the individual,” Biden said, and fails to adequately reward what he labeled team science. The vice president also called for an overhaul in how the nation does clinical trials, so that doctors can more easily find eligible patients to take part and patients can find the trials right for them. “There has got to be a better way,” he said, urging the oncologists to work to improve the system. As head of the Obama administration’s “cancer moonshot,” Biden has repeatedly stressed the importance of broad sharing of scientific data to accelerate work on therapies and even cures. He has warned that research “silos” will only slow progress. “Increasing the pool of researchers who can access data and decreasing the time it takes for them to review and find new patterns in that data is critical to speeding up development of lifesaving treatments for patients,” he said Monday. Officials hope the Genomic Data Commons will prove pivotal to advancing “precision medicine,” in which physicians attempt to tailor therapies to the specific characteristics of a person’s cancer. That has been a hot topic at the oncologists’ meeting and a priority for the administration for the several years. “What I see as transformative is, this is where the world is going, and GDC is just a part of it,” said Doug Lowy, acting director of the cancer institute said in an interview. He said Biden’s exhortations about data-sharing have driven home the point to researchers. In the past several years, vast troves of genomic cancer data have been generated as a result of rapid DNA-sequencing technology. But Louis Staudt, one of the NCI researchers leading the database effort, said in a recent interview that the information is scattered among different government and academic repositories and is sometimes out of scientists’ reach. “So one of the initial goals is to bring all the data into one place, analyze it and display it in a uniform way,” he said. The aim of GDC is for researchers to “have information at their fingertips” about relationships between abnormalities or mutations in genes and clinical outcomes, he said. The database, which will be accessible through an NCI portal, will be interactive and searchable. Scientists will be able to re-analyze the raw data according to their interests. Those most likely to use the GDC are ­researchers or researchers/clinicians, as opposed to community oncologists, Lowy said. Initially, the data is coming from big existing NCI programs, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, which has generated maps of important genomic changes in 33 types of cancer, and Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments, which focuses on pediatric cancer. Information from clinical trials funded by NCI will have to be submitted to the database, Lowy said. He said the GDC will include safeguards for patient privacy. The leaders of the nation’s major cancer centers are working on a model consent form. While the initiative is being touted as part of the administration’s moonshot effort, its roots go back years. The Institute of Medicine, in a 2011 report entitled “Toward Precision Medicine,” called for a “knowledge network of disease” that would mine genomic information for clues to patterns and treatments. It recommended the creation of a data repository for biological information along with the medical histories and health outcomes of patients. The NCI effort, which has been in the planning stages for a couple of years, is “the result of a very complex undertaking that has involved years of trial, and sometimes error, to reach fruition,” according to a blog post by Lowy and Warren Kibbe, director of the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology. The post is scheduled to be published Monday on the website Medium.	399	"[{""start"": 2472, ""end"": 2692, ""text"": ""He said Biden’s exhortations about data-sharing have driven home the point to researchers.

It was the year that we landed on a comet and launched a new era in NASA space exploration, turned to science to find a possible cure for Ebola, made robots and drones topics of everyday conversation and watched as Silicon Valley continued its rapid transition to the wearable computing revolution. The year’s big start-up was Uber, which seemed to dominate tech headlines globally for reasons both good and bad, while established Silicon Valley companies such as Facebook continued to generate attention for their visionary plans to get every human in the world online. Here are the 10 best innovations of the year and what made them so special: 1. NASA’s Orion spacecraft, for opening up a new era of manned space travel At the beginning of December, the launch of NASA’s new Orion spacecraft unofficially marked “Day One of the Mars era.” While the total time Orion spent in space before splashdown back on Earth was short — approximately 4.5 hours — the Orion spacecraft flew farther from Earth than any previous spacecraft designed for humans in over 40 years. NASA says that, by 2021, it could start crewed test flights aimed at putting astronauts on manned space trips to Mars or nearby asteroids. And it wasn’t just NASA turning heads and getting people talking about the next era of space exploration. Perhaps the most talked-about space adventure was the landing of Philae on the surface of the Rosetta comet by the European Space Agency after a 10-year odyssey in space. Not only was the Rosetta landing an historic technical accomplishment, but also it might end up offering potential clues as to the beginnings of life on Earth. India, too, made headlines with its first-ever orbiter to Mars, while NASA’s Curiosity Rover continued to send back images and data from the red planet. 2. Apple Watch, for taking wearable computers mainstream Apple’s launch of a smartwatch had been rumored for so long, it seemed almost impossible that Apple would meet expectations when the Apple Watch was finally announced on Sept. 9. And, yet, while Apple wasn’t the first to market with a new smartwatch, it was arguably the best to market. The new Apple Watch was stunning in its appearance and technological sophistication, offering Apple users the ability to make mobile payments just with a wave of the wrist. Wearable computing is now the hottest area of Silicon Valley, and the field seems to be on the cusp of having a truly breakout moment in 2015. Google Glass, despite its increasingly rocky road to market, could be one of the big stories of wearable computing in 2015. And there are plenty of other tech companies preparing new wearable computing entries for 2015, as well as potential partnerships in the works with companies like Nike. 3. ZMapp, for offering clues to a potential cure for Ebola In the scramble to find a cure for the mysterious Ebola virus, medical innovators turned to the very cutting edge of experimental research to find treatments that could slow, or perhaps even stop, the outbreak. For now, the best candidate among these appears to be ZMapp, a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies developed by researchers at San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical. In one experiment, ZMapp appeared to stop the spread of the virus in monkeys within five days of being infected. Although the drug had never before been tested in humans prior to 2014, it was given to several victims of the Ebola virus. We’re at the bold start of a new era in virology, in which medical innovators must accept that viruses such as Ebola are not random Black Swan events, but rather, events with familiar patterns that can be tracked and stopped. This will require new thinking about how to attack viruses, as well as a potential re-evaluation of the costs that society is willing to endure to bring new treatments to market. As in the case of ZMapp and Ebola, it may mean speeding up the trial period or forgoing certain testing in order to get a treatment into the hands of more people. 4. Lockheed Martin’s concept for a compact nuclear fusion reactor, for re-imagining the future of energy This year’s big breakthrough in energy was the announcement by researchers at defense giant Lockheed Martin that they were getting closer to finding a way to channel nuclear fusion in a bold new way. Rather than construct huge buildings to make a nuclear reactor, the goal is to create a compact nuclear reactor that can sit on the back of an 18-wheel truck or the wing of an airplane. In short, the same types of powerful nuclear fusion reactions that power the sun could also be used to power new forms of transportation or, potentially, even entire cities. That has huge ramifications, and not for people who enjoy driving around their own personal nuclear truck. Imagine a new era in energy, in which the costs are pushed down so dramatically that airplanes stay aloft for what seems like an infinite period of time. Of course, there are the skeptics and naysayers who can’t possibly imagine how nuclear reactors could be made that small. Yet, Lockheed Martin says that it might be possible to see a prototype within five years and an actual compact nuclear reactor within the next decade. 5. Samsung Gear VR, for bringing virtual reality to the masses The release of Samsung Gear VR, powered by Oculus, might end up taking virtual reality mainstream. Already, there have been announcements of new apps and other offerings for Gear VR, including gaming and experiential content, as well as entirely new types of films made using virtual reality technology. The Samsung Gear VR device, while still in the experimental “Innovator Edition,” is really a test case for whether there is a robust consumer market for an affordable tech device that offers an immersive, 360-degree experience. As a result, 2015 could end up being a big year for virtual reality. For example, the launch of the original VR device that you strap to your face, the Oculus Rift, is slated for release later in the year. And other big players getting into the VR mix include Sony and Google. 6. The Uberfication of everything, for showing us the upside and downside of the sharing economy The most talked-about startup in 2014 was Uber, as the company continued to expand globally at a rapid pace. In the span of just six months, Uber went from an $18 billion company to a $40 billion company, making it bigger in terms of valuation than Netflix, Tesla or Alcoa. In fact, at $40 billion, Uber would be more valuable than three-quarters of the companies in the S&P 500. As a result, it became commonplace for other startups riding the wave of Silicon Valley expectations to compare themselves to Uber in the hopes of attracting a similar type of valuation. But you don’t get that big, that fast, without making a few enemies on the way up. Uber’s worldwide push has done more than just raise concerns of taxi drivers around the world — it has exposed the downside of the global sharing economy. In the United States, Uber caused privacy experts to freak out after reports claimed the company was looking to find ways to silence its critics in the media. In India, an Uber driver allegedly raped a woman. In Sydney, the company was blamed for surge pricing after the ISIS terrorist incident caused people to flee the city. How Uber’s surging valuation fares in 2015 will rest, in no small part, on how it deals with this surge in negative publicity. 7. Heartbleed, for reminding us that everything can and will be hacked In 2014, the Heartbleed bug became the equivalent of the Y2K virus – something that everyone who used the Internet dreaded, but nobody knew exactly what it was or how it worked. People just knew it had the potential to infect a staggering number of computers in the world by exposing a major flaw in encryption software. What Heartbleed reminded us was that the Internet is “inherently chaotic, built by multitudes and continuously tweaked, with nobody in charge of it all.” And Heartbleed was just the start. Cyberhacks have become so mainstream that it almost seems expected when nationwide retailers announce major security breaches from hackers. In September, the much-hyped “Fappening” resulted in the controversial release of nude photographs of celebrities to the Internet. And, at the end of the year, the alleged North Korean hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment — and the subsequent decision to cancel release of “The Interview” — became the latest proof that foreign hackers now have the ability to impact nations and industries thousands of miles away. 8. HP Sprout, for moving us closer to a 3D-printed future In October, HP announced a bold new “Blended Reality” vision for the future of printing to make it easier for anyone to work in 3D rather than 2D. An entirely new machine – the HP Sprout – promises to transform just about everyone into a potential 3D creator. The HP Sprout is essentially an enhanced Windows PC that includes a 23-inch screen, a built-in projector with cameras, and a touch mat for manipulating images. Using the new HP Sprout, consumers will be able to create, design and manipulate 3D designs with their hands in an immersive environment. 2015 could see even more breakthroughs in 3D printing. In late 2014, for example, a group of researchers at Princeton figured out a way to 3D-print LEDs, something that had never been done before. Instead of just printing objects using standard materials, these researchers could potentially print LEDs and perhaps even semiconductors. This means that we’ll soon be able to put electronics into just about everything. This 3D printing technique could open the door to everything from flexible and wearable gadgets to bionic implants that use lights to stimulate nerves. The Princeton researchers even showcased the potential for putting an LED within a contact lens and creating a bio-electronic ear. 9. Google’s cancer-detecting pills, for showing us the future of medicine  Google X – the R&D unit within Google responsible for “moonshot” projects — once again challenged our thinking of what’s possible with the announcement in late October of a project to create a smart pill packed with tiny magnetic particles designed to circulate around the human body looking for signs of cancer and other diseases. While still in the experimental stage, the cancer-detecting pill would be able to travel through a patient’s bloodstream, searching for malignant cells and reporting their findings to a sensor device that you wear.

When Qiagen scooped up Redwood City, Calif.-based Ingenuity Systems this year, the acquisition marked the first time the biotechnology giant had purchased a firm that exclusively makes software. The purchase allows Qiagen to analyze information it derives from the genetic maps of organisms, which can be used to detect variations and mutations that point to the cause of certain diseases or new ways to treat them. The deal is indicative of the increasing interdependency of the life sciences and information technology industries. The cost of determining an organism’s genetic makeup has fallen considerably since the first human genome was mapped more than a decade ago — so much so that scientists and physicians envision a future in which DNA mapping will be standard medical practice. But that proliferation has created a need among the corporate, research and academic institutions for faster, more sophisticated software that can handle vast volumes of data. “As the cost of sequencing has come down, what we’ve seen is far more sequencing. The number of genomes has just exploded. Accordingly, what comes part and parcel with that is greater demand to analyze this information,” said William Quirk, managing director at Piper Jaffray. That demand has given rise to a number of upstarts that develop such software. It’s a niche that analysts and executives say is ripe for innovation and lacks a clear market leader. “There’s a fair amount of open opportunity here for different software companies to come in and establish themselves,” Quirk said. Devon Jensen is one. Armed with a doctoral degree in molecular and cell biology, he started Berkeley, Calif.-based Enlis Genomics two years ago. “I could see that the tools that were available were really built for the experts and not for people in labs where I came from,” Jen­sen said. “There’s a lot of utility in genomics, and I think going forward it’s going to be a big part of biology and a big part of the medical world.” Jensen said the firm sells its software — which helps researchers understand the significance of genetic variations — to a broad spectrum of customers, including small clinical labs, universities, pharmaceutical companies and even a few medical doctors. His company is far from the only player who sees an underserved market. San Diego-based Cypher Genomics was formed two years ago by scientists from the nearby Scripps Translational Science Institute and produces a similar software. Once an organism’s DNA has been mapped, the software helps make sense of genetic variations to determine whether they raise health concerns. “It’s a big problem and so that attracts a lot of folks trying to solve it,” said chief executive Ashley Van Zeeland. The field is still in its early days, however, meaning the flood of entrants is likely to consolidate as firms merge, are acquired or shut their doors. Van Zeeland expects that will be more apparent as the technology becomes more sophisticated and some programs prove more effective than others. “What the field really needs are standards so we can benchmark performance and accuracy,” she said. “It’s just so new it’s sort of the Wild West.” DNAStar, a life sciences software company, isn’t new to the scene. The company was founded by a computer science student and genetics professor from the University of Wisconsin in 1984. “Their timing was just right because this was at the dawn of personal computers as well,” said vice president and chief financial officer Tom Schwei. “They decided if they could put software tools in the hands of [scientists] that were powerful and easy to use, they would be successful.” But the DNA technology sequencing technology then was in­cred­ibly slow and expensive relative to what’s on the market today. DNAStar has since adapted its software to the needs of a modern laboratory, including adding a Internet-based “cloud” version in recent months. Schwei said the firm saw competitors get bought by large biotechnology companies more than a decade ago when the promise that genomics would lead to major medical breakthroughs was hitting its stride. Those firms languished as business units, he said. “The software side of this business, it’s hard for it to be big enough to be worth a public company’s attention,” Schwei said. But that may be changing now that long-held promise of genomics is becoming more of a reality. DNAStar, for example, entered into an agreement 21 / 2 years ago to have its software sold by Life Technologies, which offers DNA sequencing. “Often the companies that are making sequencing machines aren’t necessarily the best at creating software for the results, and so it makes sense for them to think about where they can add value to the results of their machine,” said Jensen, at Enlis Genomics. That sort of reasoning prompted Qiagen to buy Ingenuity Systems in April. And analysts expect there are likely to be further acquisitions as the market for genetics software continues to mature. “There has been a concerted interest from a number of licensed tools companies to wade into that discussion, in many ways via” mergers and acquisitions, Quirk said.	397	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 193, ""text"": ""n Qiagen scooped up Redwood City, Calif.-based Ingenuity Systems this year, the acquisition marked the first time the biotechnology giant had purchased a firm that exclusively makes software"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 195, ""end"": 414, ""text"": ""The purchase allows Qiagen to analyze information it derives from the genetic maps of organisms, which can be used to detect variations and mutations that point to the cause of certain diseases or new ways to treat them"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 416, ""end"": 531, ""text"": ""The deal is indicative of the increasing interdependency of the life sciences and information technology industrie"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 791, ""end"": 965, ""text"": ""But that proliferation has created a need among the corporate, research and academic institutions for faster, more sophisticated software that can handle vast volumes of data"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 533, ""end"": 672, ""text"": ""he cost of determining an organism’s genetic makeup has fallen considerably since the first human genome was mapped more than a decade ag"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1244, ""end"": 1424, ""text"": ""That demand has given rise to a number of upstarts that develop such software.

Facebook is on the defensive after the elections, with accusations that it helped spread misinformation. For days, Mark Zuckerberg was adamant that his network had not affected the election results, calling that “a pretty crazy idea.” But after a torrent of criticism from his employees and the media — and indication that fake election news spread widely — he relented and took responsibility. He promised to improve Facebook’s detection, reporting and verification of news. The tech industry has stepped into the field of publishing and communications without accepting the responsibility that comes with doing so. It’s not just Facebook. Twitter has allowed trolls to harass its users. The ethical codes we live by and the laws we follow are changing very slowly while technologies move too fast to care. It isn’t greed and arrogance; more often than not, the technologies’ creators (and this probably includes Zuckerberg) don’t understand the power of their creations — and the damage they can do. We are going to see much more of that. Technologies in computing, medicine, sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics and genomics are now advancing exponentially and are converging. This means that one industry can encroach on another and cause the type of disruption that social media did to publishing. I doubt that anyone expected that a dating site set up by a college dropout would have had the ability to change the outcome of the U.S. elections. The technology industry is building medical devices, robots and self-driving cars from computers, sensors and A.I. — the same types of technologies that Uber and Airbnb used to disrupt the taxi and hotel industries, respectively. They have taken advantage of the gaps between laws and ethics, just as Facebook and Twitter have, to build billion-dollar businesses. This is what the future holds. But are we ready for tech companies to become dominant players in the field of medicine, as will happen when we have A.I. applications that can do the work of doctors? Are we prepared for the elimination of millions of taxi- and truck-driver jobs when Uber’s self-driving vehicles begin to hit the roads? And are we ready for the “uberization” of large employment segments, as they move into what is called the gig economy, in which they hire people on demand? All of this will become a reality in the next five or 10 years. The fact is that we are not prepared for any of it, just as we were not ready for the disruptions that social media caused. The tech industry, in particular, is happy to book the revenue it gains from other industries and to shirk responsibility for the damage it does. It is easier to pretend that the technologies do no harm than to deal with the problems they create. Increasingly pervasive data networks and connected devices are enabling rapid communication and processing of information and ushering in unprecedented shifts — in everything from biology, energy, and media to politics, food and transportation. They are redefining our future. It is imperative that we, as a society, understand technology’s impact on us and hold discussions and even heated debates about its use before that future becomes inevitable reality.	396	"[{""start"": 1457, ""end"": 1571, ""text"": ""The technology industry is building medical devices, robots and self-driving cars from computers, sensors and A.I."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1821, ""end"": 2019, ""text"": ""This is what the future holds.

Elizabeth Holmes, the embattled founder and chief executive of Theranos, said late Wednesday that the company will close its clinical labs and wellness centers. The open letter, posted on the company’s website, was essentially an epitaph for the consumer business that was the focus of the once-celebrated Silicon Valley company that Holmes boasted would change the world with its simple and inexpensive pinprick blood test. In magazine interviews, TV appearances and keynote speeches she gave around the world, Holmes said the innovation would empower consumers by giving them the ability to bypass the gatekeepers — their doctors — to get important information about the health of their own bodies. Numerous investors and consumers fell for her story, and at one point the company was valued at $9 billion, making Holmes the youngest self-made female billionaire ever. But as the company grew, so did questions about its technology. In a series of skeptical reports starting in October 2015, the Wall Street Journal recounted how even Theranos's own employees questioned the accuracy of the results of its testing and revealed that government regulators had been looking into the matter. The company aggressively defended itself against the accusations but over the summer acknowledged major defeats. In June, Walgreens said it had terminated its partnership with the blood testing start-up effective immediately. In July, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services imposed harsh sanctions against Theranos, imposing a fine, revoking its certificate for a lab and banning Holmes from owning, operating or directing a blood-testing lab for at least two years. Wednesday's announcement essentially shuts down the consumer-focused operations that were at the heart of the vision Holmes promoted. The move will affect about 340 employees in Arizona, California and Pennsylvania, and Holmes was generous in recognizing them for sticking by her. “We are profoundly grateful to these team members, many of whom have devoted years to Theranos and our mission, for their commitment to our company and our guests,” she wrote. Holmes said the company will now focus its “undivided attention” on the Theranos miniLab platform which she described as a product that would be “miniaturized, automated laboratories capable of small-volume sample testing, with an emphasis on vulnerable patient populations, including oncology, pediatrics, and intensive care.” This post has been updated.

"[This story has been revised and updated.] Genetic engineering isn't new, but CRISPR is, and it's a stunningly fast, flexible, cheap way to manipulate the code of life. It's so revolutionary — and unnerving — that hundreds of scientists, policymakers and the president's science adviser gathered Tuesday in Washington for the start of a three-day summit on the implications of this astonishing technology. Developed only in the past four years, the CRISPR technique exploits a natural process used by ordinary bacteria to defend against invasive viruses. It enables rank-and-file scientists — just about anyone with a modern laboratory and the right skills — to alter specific genes within plants and animals and make those changes heritable. This kind of gene editing could potentially be used in gene therapies targeting a variety of devastating, heritable diseases. But many researchers argue that it is too soon, and potentially too dangerous, to tinker with the human genome in a way that is passed down to future generations. One objection is simply pragmatic: Biological systems are extremely complex, and changing human genes could have unintended and undesirable consequences. And many bioethicists are not comfortable with the prospect that gene editing could be used for purely cosmetic enhancements, or in an attempt to give certain people physical and intellectual advantages. “The overriding question is when, if ever, we will want to use gene editing to change human inheritance,"" summit chair David Baltimore of Caltech said in his introductory remarks. The summit kicked off Tuesday morning at the headquarters of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the sponsors, along with the National Academy of Medicine, the Royal Society (United Kingdom), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Chinese scientists have been aggressive in using CRISPR, and one team made news this year when it reported results from experiments on nonviable human embryos. The first set of speakers put the summit in historical context. An Egyptian historian, Ismail Serageldin of the Library of Alexandria, offered a broad view of human engagement with the natural world: “We have been playing god ever since we domesticated plants and animals."" Daniel Kevles, an emeritus historian at Yale, offered a tutorial on the eugenics movement in the early 20th century, noting that although it reached its genocidal zenith in Nazi Germany, it also had intellectual support in the United States on both ends of the political spectrum. He said that today, the driving force for human genetic modification will be consumer demand, with the biotech industry serving as ""a new player in this game."" Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, reviewed the different approaches that countries have taken in trying to regulate gene therapy. She favored a precautionary approach that she said would not suppress innovation, arguing that responsible oversight would allow researchers to take more chances. ""We have the chance to back up at the end, and change course,"" she said. The reason CRISPR is so controversial is that it works well on mammalian""germline"" cells, such as sperm, eggs and embryonic cells, and the genetic editing can therefore result in heritable traits. Baltimore said he hopes the final session Thursday will produce recommendations for a path forward. The gathering has an obvious analog to the famous Asilomar conference of 1975. That gathering on the Monterey Peninsula was called after scientists realized they could splice DNA from one organism into another. Their primary purpose was to ensure that such work was safe, both for the researchers and the natural world, recalled Baltimore, who was among the participants. The Asilomar conference produced a set of safety protocols that allowed the research to continue. Now comes CRISPR. The technique borrows a move from bacteria. In a bacterium's DNA are segments of genetic information that bear the likeness of viral pathogens, kind of like the FBI's Most Wanted bulletins at the post office. The bacterium has an enzyme, called Cas9, that can read that likeness, scout the environment for anything looking the same, and then, when finding a likely suspect, snip lengthwise the entwined double-helix DNA strands of the invader. The CRISPR technique uses the Cas9 enzyme as a gene-snipper. If properly targeted, it can precisely edit genes. Getting to a high level of precision has been tricky to date, but researchers have made great strides in just the few years since the idea of using the enzyme for gene editing emerged from laboratories in Massachusetts and California. (Who, exactly, discovered the CRISPR technique and deserves the patents for it is a matter of intense legal wrangling.) Tuesday morning, even as the scientists gathered at the National Academy, news broke from the journal Science that researchers at the Broad Institute, Harvard University and M.I.T. have come up with a new way to use CRISPR that reduces the potential for off-target gene-snipping. This promises to enhance the efficiency of the gene-editing tool. Among the authors of the new paper is one of the pioneers of the CRISPR technique, Feng Zhang — who is here for the summit. “It’s the tip of the iceberg,"" Zhang said during a panel discussion on the latest scientific breakthroughs. ""These are all systems that came from nature. They were discovered by basic biology."" He pointed out that living things have been evolving for billions of years, and that they use a great number of enzymes that potentially can be harnessed by human scientists to edit genes. ""If we look into natural diversity, there are many more systems that will likely prove to be even more powerful,"" Zhang said.  ""We may be able to take the human editing technology to an even higher level.” In a meeting with a strikingly large media contingent, Baltimore said he thinks the simplicity of CRISPR has been somewhat over-hyped. ""It's not something you can do in a garage,"" he said. And Jennifer Doudna, a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California at Berkeley and one of the pioneers of the CRISPR technology, told reporters that it will be many years before this technique results in treatments for human diseases. As for human enhancement, that's also a long way off, she said. ""We don't understand enough yet about the human genome, and how genes interact, and which genes give rise to certain traits to edit for human enhancement today,"" she said. George Church, a Harvard Medical School geneticist who published one of the early papers on the use of CRISPR on mammalian cells, pointed out that people in his field have been doing genetic modification for decades, and said there are already 2,000 gene therapy trials underway, none of which use CRISPR. What's really different with this new technique, he said, is the cost. “It's about 1,000 times cheaper for an ordinary academic to do,"" Church said. ""It could be a game-changer.” When a reporter asked how long it would be before humans have wings, Church answered without missing a beat: “We already have 747s. Way better than wings.” Read More: British scientists seek to edit the genes of embryos; bioethicists warn of potential dangers Scientists create bacteria that need synthetic food and can't survive in the wild Should we be worried about synthetic organisms cooked up in the lab?

Genetically engineered microbes that might one day churn out biofuels, clean up toxic waste or generate new medicines need to be proved safe before they are released into the environment, a coalition of 111 environmental and social justice groups said Tuesday. Led by the environmental advocacy group Friends of the Earth, the coalition also called for stronger government regulations over “extreme genetic engineering” and a moratorium on the commercial use and release of lab-created organisms. “Without proper safeguards, we risk letting synthetic organisms and their products out of the laboratory with unknown potential to disrupt ecosystems, threaten human health and undermine social, economic and cultural rights,” the coalition said in a new report. The technology to manipulate the genes of bacteria, yeast and other organisms has existed since the 1970s, leading to pest-resistant crops, bacteria that produce human insulin and other breakthroughs. But in 2010, biologist J. Craig Venter announced that his institute had invented “synthetic biology” by transplanting the entire genome of one bacterium into a different species, which then reproduced. While not qualifying as an entirely new organism, the lab-built microbe did fuel concerns that this technology presented new and hard-to-quantify risks. The White House jumped in, with the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommending in 2010 that federal agencies adopt a “middle course” that encouraged enhanced oversight and careful consideration of possible risks but no new laws or regulations. Environmental groups say those measures don’t go far enough. “The field is evolving incredibly rapidly in the face of almost no regulation,” said Eric Hoffman of Friends of the Earth. “A moratorium puts the brakes on to allow society time to decide which applications are okay and which aren’t.” Representatives of the biotechnology industry say that genetically modified organisms are already adequately regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Agriculture Department, the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies. “I think the report’s kind of silly, frankly. It makes no sense to call for a moratorium,” said Brett Erickson, executive vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group. “We’ve been doing genetic engineering for 30 years, and we’ve been doing it safely. People are hyping this as something new.” The burden of proof for safety should fall on companies designing new organisms, the environmental groups said, with synthetic organisms subjected to independent study and corralled by “the strictest levels of physical, biological and geographical containment.” Hoffman said a number of government agencies should help regulate synthetic biology, including the Energy Department, which funds research in the field; the USDA; the FDA; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Work in synthetic biology is still confined to laboratories, but researchers see potential for advances in energy production, medicine and other fields. Think tanks are also getting involved in the debate over how to regulate the field. In 2010, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars launched a project on synthetic biology to push for more research on the risks and benefits of new genetic technology. “The more engaged people are — not just the public, but federal agencies, regulatory agencies and scientists — the better off we are in terms of reaping benefits of these technologies,” said Todd Kuiken, a scientist at the center who is engaged in that project but was not involved in the report released Tuesday. Kuiken added that government agencies have done little to respond to the recommendations made by the president’s commission 15 months ago.“We approached numerous agencies, including the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which should be coordinating this activity. They gave us nothing. Literally nothing.” Allison A. Snow, a plant ecologist at Ohio State University who keeps a close eye on synthetic biology but was not involved in the new report, said, “The technology is outpacing the research needed to understand environmental risks.

SAN FRANCISCO — Helmy Eltoukhy’s company is on a roll. The start-up is a leading contender in the crowded field of firms working on “liquid biopsy” tests that aim to be able to tell in a single blood draw whether a person has cancer.   Venture investors are backing Guardant Health to the tune of nearly $200 million. Leading medical centers are testing its technology. And earlier this month, it presented promising data on how well its screening tool, which works by scanning for tiny DNA fragments shed by dying tumor cells, worked on an initial group of 10,000 patients with late-stage cancers. Just one thing is holding the company back: Guardant Health has yet to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration. As a tidal wave of new health-related gadgets, apps and tests hits the market, government agencies like the FDA, Federal Trade Commission and others are showing up in Silicon Valley like they’ve never done before. They have slapped companies such as Theranos, 23andMe, Lumosity and Pathway Genomics with warning letters and fines and raised questions about products that regulators believe promise more than they can deliver. More regulatory scrutiny is probably coming. Venture capital investments in life sciences hit a record high in 2015, with $10.1 billion invested in 783 deals, and total start-up funding is approaching levels of the last dot-com bubble — a development that has some industry observers worried that pseudoscience is being confused with innovation. But even as some companies push back against federal agencies’ reach — contesting which rules, if any, apply to their work — there’s now recognition that the government can be a powerful ally rather than a brake on progress. And its stamp of approval can take firms from being worth multimillions to multibillions. Jeff Huber, a former senior Google executive who is now chief executive of Grail, which is also working on liquid biopsy tests, said his company reached out to FDA officials while still in the research-and-development phase and is “carefully considering their input as to the right approach.” “A core part of our reputation and brand is the scientific rigor we’re putting behind this,” Huber said. That includes designing rigorous, large-scale clinical trials targeted to begin in 2017. (Grail’s early backers include Bill Gates and Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.) Putting a product on the market without consulting with the FDA is risky, but companies doing so have a legal argument for their move. Guardant Health contends that the liquid biopsy test it began selling to oncologists in 2014 falls outside the agency’s purview because the end result is data about the composition of a person’s blood, not a definitive diagnosis. Even so, its founder said he proactively contacted a local FDA office a few months ago to express his eagerness to work with the agency in the future. “It’s the patient at the end of the day who is the person we’re trying to help,” said Eltoukhy, who has a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford University. “We’re not doing them any justice or any benefits by putting a technology that’s not ready for prime time into the market.” Given the super-hot field, the pressure to be first remains intense, however. Nearly 40 companies are working there, according to a research report by Piper Jaffray analysts William Quirk and Alexander Nowak, who valued the U.S. market alone at $32.6 billion a year. Liquid biopsies, they noted, could “revolutionize” cancer, transplant and prenatal care. Being tested for cancer today often means having a slice of tissue cut out — which can be painful and dangerous — and waiting days or even weeks for the results to come back. The promise of liquid biopsies is that the same information might be available based on an extremely low-risk blood draw that takes mere minutes.  The concept is so simple and potentially inexpensive that it could upend practically everything about the disease. Healthy people would be able to walk into their doctor’s office for an annual checkup and know whether they had cancer well before it becomes life-threatening. Doctors would be able to track their patients’ responses to therapies almost in real time by studying which cancerous mutations are in the mix and in what concentration. Yet the science behind liquid biopsies is incredibly tricky because of how cancerous DNA is obscured by healthy DNA in the blood, with a sophisticated combination of molecular biology, informatics, genetic sequencing and other disciplines required to reveal it. Eltoukhy likens the challenge to trying to find the fine details in the “snow” on a TV screen that’s relying on an old rabbit-ears antenna. Guardant Health has had early success with its screening tool in late-stage cancer patients, and about 2,000 oncologists are using it to help create personalized therapies when first-line treatments have failed. The company says its test is the most comprehensive on the market, examining more than 150,000 places in the genome compared with the half-dozen or so that many competitors review. It has partnered with the National Cancer Institute as well as some major pharmaceutical companies for further investigations.  In the abstract presented at the American Association for Cancer Research this month — though not peer-reviewed, it is being submitted to a journal, according to Eltoukhy — the company said the test was as “highly accurate” as a surgical biopsy in detecting cancerous DNA. Lung, gastrointestinal and breast cancers were most commonly found. Still, the real game-changer would be a test that can pinpoint cancer in its earliest stages, when the amount of DNA in the blood is mind-bogglingly small. Pathway Genomics claimed to have done just that when it launched a direct-to-consumer $699 screening tool last year for the early detection of up to 10 different cancer types among people at high risk but without symptoms. The FDA disagreed. In a letter in  September, the agency warned that it had not found any evidence to support the claims and that the product could “harm the public health.” The company declined to talk about its discussions with regulators, but the FDA said Pathway Genomics has since made the test available only by prescription and “also limited the claims of what their test does to ones that seem to be more in line with the current available evidence.” Separately, the company recently paid the Justice Department $4 million to settle allegations that it offered kickbacks to physicians to refer patients to its service. It admitted no wrongdoing. The FDA’s mandate was written decades before anyone could imagine these new technologies, so the extent of its powers continues to be much debated.  The agency said in a statement Thursday that it considers all diagnostic in vitro tests — which include blood tests — to be medical devices but that it has not always “exercised enforcement discretion over laboratory-developed tests except for those being marketed direct-to-consumers.” “All devices, including diagnostic tests, are subject to FDA regulation,” the statement noted. Guardant Health is far from the only firm to claim that its blood tests — or,  in the case of 23andMe, spit tests — fall outside the FDA's regulatory bounds because they’re simply informational and do not definitively detect diseases, conditions or infections that lead to treatment decisions. Guardant's labs do have certification under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) which sets quality control and other standards. But growing evidence suggests the tide may be shifting on this view. Massimo Cristofanilli, an oncologist at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, has used Guardant Health’s test on more than 200 breast cancer patients with late-stage disease and said it has been helpful in about 6o to 70 percent of cases to determine a next course of treatment. He sees FDA approval as critical for widespread adoption. “Physicians, especially community physicians, won’t feel comfortable until they have more of a guarantee that the tests are doing what they are supposed to be doing,” he said. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, thinks FDA approval isn’t the panacea some believe it to be. Even if a liquid biopsy is rigorously validated, he said, it may be able to identify only the presence of a cancer, not where it is or whether it will have an impact on a person’s health. It’s possible that some people could have cancer, per a DNA test, that will never grow into something that will hurt them. “The purpose of the screening test is more than to find disease. The purpose is to find disease in a situation such that medical treatment can prevent death,” Brawley said. “There’s a bunch of folks in the corporate community who don’t understand that fine detail.” This post has been updated.

Scientists in Portland, Ore., just succeeded in creating the first genetically modified human embryo in the United States, according to Technology Review. A team led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health & Science University is reported to “have broken new ground both in the number of embryos experimented upon and by demonstrating that it is possible to safely and efficiently correct defective genes that cause inherited diseases.” The U.S. team’s results follow two trials — one last year and one in April — by researchers in China who injected genetically modified cells into cancer patients. The research teams used CRISPR, a new gene-editing system derived from bacteria that enables scientists to edit the DNA of living organisms. The era of human gene editing has begun. In the short term, scientists are planning clinical trials to use CRISPR to edit human genes linked to cystic fibrosis and other fatal hereditary conditions. But supporters of synthetic biology talk up huge potential long-term benefits. We could, they claim, potentially edit genes and build new ones to eradicate all hereditary diseases. With genetic alterations, we might be able to withstand anthrax attacks or epidemics of pneumonic plague. We might revive extinct species such as the woolly mammoth. We might design plants that are far more nutritious, hardy and delicious than what we have now. But developments in gene editing are also highlighting a desperate need for ethical and legal guidelines to regulate in vitro genetic editing — and raising concerns about a future in which the well-off could pay for CRISPR to perfect their offspring. We will soon be faced with very difficult decisions about when and how to use this breakthrough medical technology. For example, if your unborn child were going to have a debilitating disease that you could fix by taking a pill to edit their genome, would you take the pill? How about adding some bonus intelligence? Greater height or strength? Where would you draw the line? CRISPR’s potential for misuse by changing inherited human traits has prompted some genetic researchers to call for a global moratorium on using the technique to modify human embryos. Such use is a criminal offense in 29 countries, and the United States bans the use of federal funds to modify embryos. Still, CRISPR’s seductiveness is beginning to overtake the calls for caution. In February, an advisory body from the National Academy of Sciences announced the academy’s support for using CRISPR to edit the genes of embryos to remove DNA sequences that doctors say cause serious heritable diseases. The recommendation came with significant caveats and suggested limiting the use of CRISPR to specific embryonic problems. That said, the recommendation is clearly an endorsement of CRISPR as a research tool that is likely to become a clinical treatment — a step from which there will be no turning back. CRISPR’s combination of usability, low cost and power is both tantalizing and frightening, with the potential to someday enable anyone to edit a living creature on the cheap in their basements. So, although scientists might use CRISPR to eradicate malaria by making the mosquitoes that carry it infertile, bioterrorists could use it to create horrific pathogens that could kill tens of millions of people. With the source code of life now so easy to hack, and biologists and the medical world ready to embrace its possibilities, how do we ensure the responsible use of CRISPR? There’s a line that “A Prairie Home Companion” host Garrison Keillor uses when describing the fictional town of Lake Wobegon, where “all the children are above average.” Will we enter a time when those who can afford a better genome will live far longer, healthier lives than those who cannot? Should the U.S. government subsidize genetic improvements to ensure a level playing field when the rich have access to the best genetics that money can buy and the rest of society does not? And what if CRISPR introduces traits into the human germ line with unforeseen consequences — perhaps higher rates of cardiac arrest or schizophrenia? Barriers to mass use of CRISPR are already falling. Dog breeders looking to improve breeds suffering from debilitating maladies are actively pursuing gene hacking. A former NASA fellow in synthetic biology now sells functional bacterial engineering CRISPR kits for $150 from his online store. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which the big drugstore chains carry CRISPR kits for home testing and genetic engineering. The release of genetically modified organisms into the wild in the past few years has raised considerable ethical and scientific questions. The potential consequences of releasing genetically crippled mosquitoes in the southern United States to reduce transmission of tropical viruses, for instance, drew a firestorm of concern over the effects on humans and the environment. So, while the prospect of altering the genes of people — modern-day eugenics — has caused a schism in the science community, research with precisely that aim is happening all over the world. We have arrived at a Rubicon. Humans are on the verge of finally being able to modify their own evolution. The question is whether they can use this newfound superpower in a responsible way that will benefit the planet and its people. And a decision so momentous cannot be left to the doctors, the experts or the bureaucrats. Failing to figure out how to ensure that everyone will benefit from this breakthrough risks the creation of a genetic underclass who must struggle to compete with the genetically modified offspring of the rich. And failing to monitor and contain how we use it may spell global catastrophe. It’s up to us collectively to get this right.	391	"[{""start"": 155, ""end"": 739, ""text"": ""A team led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health & Science University is reported to “have broken new ground both in the number of embryos experimented upon and by demonstrating that it is possible to safely and efficiently correct defective genes that cause inherited diseases.” The U.S. team’s results follow two trials — one last year and one in April — by researchers in China who injected genetically modified cells into cancer patients. The research teams used CRISPR, a new gene-editing system derived from bacteria that enables scientists to edit the DNA of living organisms"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2390, ""end"": 2609, ""text"": ""In February, an advisory body from the National Academy of Sciences announced the academy’s support for using CRISPR to edit the genes of embryos to remove DNA sequences that doctors say cause serious heritable diseases"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	399	2023-03-31T13:26:15.892836Z	2023-03-31T13:26:15.892895Z	394.515
Twelve years ago was a low point for Brendan Frey. His wife at the time was pregnant, but genetic counselors told the couple that something was wrong with the baby. “There was a problem, but they really couldn’t tell us how serious it was,” Frey recalled to me. “It was sort of a genetic problem that could be nothing or could be disastrous.” The couple struggled with stress and emotional pain. Frey was frustrated with how little was known about the causes of genetic diseases, and the lack of treatments. So he decided to make a huge change in this life. The painful episode was a trigger for a career metamorphosis that has brought Frey to a promising moment today. He’s launched a start-up, Deep Genomics, that thinks it can transform medicine by applying the hot field of deep learning to genomics. Back in 2003 Frey had been researching computer vision at the University of Toronto, a hotbed of deep learning research. Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence in which computers learn to identify and categorize patterns in huge data sets. For examples, a self-driving car could use deep learning to identify pedestrians. Or a photo app might automatically group all of your photos of your grandmother or beach vacation together. With frustration fresh on his mind, Frey knew he wanted to work on genomics. Out of hardship, Frey sought a way to make a positive impact, and his deep learning background would be his secret weapon. “How can I make a difference to the next couple that shows up for genetic counseling and needs to figure out what’s going on genetically,” Frey said. “A billion dollars had been spent on the genome, it was obviously very important, but really people could not make sense of the genome.” Frey began to develop a rare skill-set — combining genomics and deep learning. He published papers in leading academic journals and gave talks at conferences and universities. But years went by and medicine wasn’t transforming. Other researchers and companies weren’t running with the work, which surprised Frey. “It wasn’t enough to be publishing these research papers, we needed to get out there,” Frey said. “Not just publishing research papers that people are impressed with, but don’t know how to act on them, but actually getting inside of the value chain.” His team would spin out of the University of Toronto and launch a start-up —Deep Genomics. Frey had gradually realized how rare his expertise in both deep learning and genetics was. Deep learning is currently a hot field in technology, but it’s a small one. Much of the talent has passed through the University of Toronto’s deep learning group. For example, Yann LeCun now leads Facebook’s artificial intelligence research lab. Geoffrey Hinton, who Frey had worked on machine vision with, now works at Google. Yoshua Bengio is collaborating with IBM’s Watson group. Google and Facebook are paying engineers proficient in deep learning upward of $250,000 a year — and the most experienced can earn in the seven figures, according to a Re/code report. While most deep learning work tries to bring human capabilities to machines, Frey wants the machines to be able to do something humans can’t do. “Humans are good at text analysis, humans are good at speech recognition, but humans do not understand the text of the genome,” Frey said. “So it’s a much more exciting problem to me, it’s like we’re completely in the dark.” A deep learning system that’s able to digest a massive amount of genetic data has the potential to understand the impact of genetic mutations better than humans ever have. The impact of mutations depends on their context. As Frey gets access to more data sets, of say individuals with autism, the deep learning system can better draw conclusions about how genetics is driving real world outcomes. For now, much work remains. LeCun described Frey’s progress so far as a baby step. But the huge potential is there. LeCun recalled to me watching Frey give a talk about his work in December to a group of deep learning researchers. “We all thought it was amazing, and a pretty great tool once the dust settled,” said LeCun, who is now on Deep Genomics board of directors. He also cautioned about legal and commercial obstacles. The long-term goal for Deep Genomics is to transform medicine through pharmaceuticals and personalized medicine. But Frey, aware of the regulatory and clinical trials that make pharmaceutical work a slow process, is targeting genetic testing in the short term.	390	"[{""start"": 670, ""end"": 804, ""text"": ""He’s launched a start-up, Deep Genomics, that thinks it can transform medicine by applying the hot field of deep learning to genomics."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3333, ""end"": 3589, ""text"": ""So it’s a much more exciting problem to me, it’s like we’re completely in the dark.” A deep learning system that’s able to digest a massive amount of genetic data has the potential to understand the impact of genetic mutations better than humans ever have."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4242, ""end"": 4354, ""text"": ""The long-term goal for Deep Genomics is to transform medicine through pharmaceuticals and personalized medicine."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	398	2023-03-31T13:19:38.243229Z	2023-03-31T13:19:38.243295Z	246.565
At the inaugural World of Watson event in New York Tuesday, IBM announced a new Watson Genomics initiative that will utilize the computing capabilities of Watson to make it easier and faster to fight cancer. It will now be possible for clinicians at more than a dozen cancer institutes around the nation to apply Watson’s data-crunching abilities to sequence the genome of a cancerous tumor and then access the most relevant information in the medical literature to recommend a treatment option. The goal is an ambitious one: personalized medicine for cancer patients everywhere based on their unique genomic profile. In the initial phase of the program, participating organizations will apply Watson to analyze the genomic data of patients who are battling all types of cancer, including lymphoma, melanoma, pancreatic, ovarian, brain, lung, breast and colorectal cancer. In cases where surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatment have failed, these cancer patients could benefit from isolating treatments that target their specific cancer-causing genetic mutations. The collaborations at these institutions — including New York Genome Center, McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis, University of North Carolina Lineberger Cancer Center and Yale Cancer Center — will enable clinicians to use Watson with an expanded set of patients by the end of 2015. [The incredible potential and dangers of data mining health records] The most important factor, say clinicians involved in the new Watson genomics initiative, is the faster processing time of DNA insights made possible by using Watson. In some cases, the processing time can be reduced from weeks to minutes. This is critically important, given the amount of genomic data out there. As IBM pointed out at World of Watson, one person’s genetic code is the equivalent of 1.5 billion characters of text, or 10,714,286 tweets. If you printed out the 3.2 billion letters in your genome, it would take a century to recite, if recited at the rate of one letter per second, 24 hours a day. “When you are dealing with cancer, it is always a race,” said Lukas Wartman, assistant director of cancer genomics at the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis, who spoke at the World of Watson event. “As a cancer patient myself, I know how important genomic information can be. Unfortunately, translating cancer-sequencing results into potential treatment options often takes weeks with a team of experts to study just one patient’s tumor and provide results to guide treatment decisions. Watson appears to help dramatically reduce that timeline.” Rolling out Watson to more than a dozen cancer institutes around the nation is just the beginning. At some point, any oncologist might have access to Watson, meaning that cancer patients in any geographic locale would benefit, not just those located near a major cancer research institute. “This collaboration is about giving clinicians the ability to do for a broader population what is currently only available to a small number – deliver personalized, precision cancer treatments,” said Steve Harvey, vice president of IBM Watson Health. “The technology that we’re applying to this challenge brings the power of cognitive computing to bear on one of the most urgent and pressing issues of our time – the fight against cancer – in a way that has never before been possible.” And best of all, Watson will continue to learn on the job as it hunts for appropriate oncology treatments. That means that Watson will gain in value and knowledge over time, based on previous interactions with medical practitioners. The more that participating institutions use Watson to assist clinicians in identifying cancer-causing mutations, the more that Watson’s rationale and insights will improve. With the help of Watson, developers and partners are already creating other apps and services that harness the power of cognitive computing to help health care professionals do their jobs better and solve important challenges. At the World of Watson event, for example, Watson Health developers showcased new apps and services built on top of the Watson platform. The medical community has already been one of the earliest adopters of Watson cognitive computing technology, where IBM has collaborated with leading hospitals and research institutes including Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo Clinic and the New York Genome Center. Of course, there are still some challenges ahead for Watson. Processing unstructured data – images of cancerous tumors or notes that oncologists might add to a patient’s medical file – is a lot harder than processing structured data. Physicians shouldn’t have to be programmers and coders to extract insights, something that IBM Watson recognizes. And there’s still the human aspect of working together with patients to agree on the appropriate treatment option. Keep in mind, however, that the goal of IBM’s cognitive computing initiative for health care is not intended for Watson to replace physicians, nurses and other medical practitioners. The metaphor IBM typically uses for Watson is one of a “capable and knowledgeable colleague” who can respond faster, read more and crunch more data than humans. As a result, Watson can play an important role in fighting cancer simply by doing all the heavy lifting of clinicians — crunching patient genomic data and sifting through hundreds of medical journals to see what treatment options might be available. As  Lukas Wartman of the Washington University’s School of Medicine points out, “I hope it will be possible for oncologists like me to quickly mine insights from the immense amount of genomic data that’s becoming available about individual patients by using Watson to identify potential drugs that target our patients’ specific genetic profiles.” The hope is that this new Watson Genomics initiative will be about more than just enabling researchers at medical institutions to mine a much larger store of data. The real hope is that cognitive computing also implies creative computing – a computer that thinks out of the box based on industry best practices to arrive at solutions and recommendations that would impress even a human doctor.	389	"[{""start"": 3, ""end"": 206, ""text"": ""e inaugural World of Watson event in New York Tuesday, IBM announced a new Watson Genomics initiative that will utilize the computing capabilities of Watson to make it easier and faster to fight cancer"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 496, ""end"": 617, ""text"": ""The goal is an ambitious one: personalized medicine for cancer patients everywhere based on their unique genomic profile."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1617, ""end"": 1762, ""text"": ""In some cases, the processing time can be reduced from weeks to minutes.

The battle between the FBI and Apple over the unlocking of a terrorist’s iPhone will likely require Congress to create new legislation. That’s because there really aren’t any existing laws which encompass technologies such as these. The battle is between security and privacy, with Silicon Valley fighting for privacy. The debates in Congress will be ugly, uninformed, and emotional. Lawmakers won’t know which side to pick and will flip flop between what lobbyists ask and the public’s fear du jour. And because there is no consensus on what is right or wrong, any decision they make today will likely be changed tomorrow. This is a prelude of things to come, not only with encryption technologies, but everything from artificial intelligence to drones, robotics, and synthetic biology. Technology is moving faster than our ability to understand it and there is no consensus on what is ethical. It isn’t just the lawmakers who are not well-informed, the originators of the technologies themselves don’t understand the full ramifications of what they are creating. They may take strong positions today based on their emotions and financial interests but as they learn more, they too will change their views. Imagine if there was a terror attack in Silicon Valley — at the headquarters of Facebook or Apple. Do you think that Tim Cook or Mark Zuckerberg would continue to put privacy ahead of national security? It takes decades, sometimes centuries, to reach the type of consensus that is needed to enact the far-reaching legislation that Congress will have to consider. Laws are essentially codified ethics, a consensus that is reached by society on what is right and wrong. This happens only after people understand the issues and have seen the pros and cons. Consider our laws on privacy. These date back to the late 1800s, when newspapers first started publishing gossip. They wrote a series of intrusive stories about Boston lawyer Samuel Warren and his family. This led his law partner, future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, writing a Harvard Law Review article “The Right of Privacy”  which argued for the right to be left alone. This essay laid the foundation of American privacy law, which evolved over 200 years. It also took centuries to create today’s copyright laws, intangible property rights, and contract law. All of these followed the development of technologies such as the printing press and steam engine. Today, technology is progressing on an exponential curve; advances that would take decades now happen in years, sometimes months. Consider that the first iPhone was released in June 2007. It was little more than an iPod with an embedded cell phone. This has evolved into a device which captures our deepest personal secrets, keeps track of our lifestyles and habits, and is becoming our health coach and mentor. It was inconceivable just five years ago that there could be such debates about unlocking this device. A greater privacy risk than the lock on the iPhone are the cameras and sensors that are being placed everywhere. There are cameras on our roads, in public areas and malls, and in office buildings. One company just announced that it is partnering with AT&T to track people’s travel patterns and behaviors through their mobile phones so that its billboards can display personalized ads. Even billboards will also include cameras to watch the expressions of passersby. Cameras often record everything that is happening. Soon there will be cameras looking down at us from drones and in privately owned microsatellites. Our TVs, household appliances, and self-driving cars will be watching us. The cars will also keep logs of where we have been and make it possible to piece together who we have met and what we have done — just as our smartphones can already do. These technologies have major security risks and are largely unregulated. Each has its nuances and will require different policy considerations. The next technology which will surprise, shock, and scare the public is gene editing.  CRISPR–Cas9 is a system for engineering genomes that was simultaneously developed by teams of scientists at different universities. This technology, which has become inexpensive enough for labs all over the world to use, allows the editing of genomes—the basic building blocks of life. It holds the promise of providing cures for genetic diseases, creating drought resistant and high-yield plants, and new sources of fuel. It can also be used to “edit” the genomes of animals and human beings. China is leading the way in creating commercial applications for CRISPR, having edited goats, sheep, pigs, monkeys and dogs. It has given them larger muscles, more fur and meat, and altered their shapes and sizes. Scientists demonstrated that these traits can be passed to future generations, thereby creating a new species. China sees this as a way to feed its billion people and provide it a global advantage. China has also made progress in creating designer babies. In April 2015, scientists in China revealed that they had tried using CRISPR to edit the genomes of human embryos. Although these embryos could not develop to term, viable embryos could one day be engineered to cure disease or provide desirable traits. The risk is that geneticists with good intentions could mistakenly engineer changes in DNA that generate dangerous mutations and cause painful deaths. In Dec. 2015, an international group of scientists gathered at the National Academy of Sciences to call for a moratorium on making inheritable changes to the human genome until there is a “broad societal consensus about the appropriateness” of any proposed change. But then, this February the British government announced that it has approved experiments by scientists at Francis Crick Institute to treat certain cases of infertility. I have little doubt that these scientists will not cross any ethical lines. But is there anything to stop governments themselves from surreptitiously working to develop a race of superhuman soldiers? The creators of these technologies usually don’t understand the long term ramifications of what they are creating and when they do, it is often too late, as was the case with CRISPR. One of its inventors, Jennifer Doudna wrote a touching essay in the December issue of Nature. “I was regularly lying awake at night wondering whether I could justifiably stay out of an ethical storm that was brewing around a technology I had helped to create”, she lamented. She has called for human genome editing to the “be on hold pending a broader societal discussion of the scientific and ethical issues surrounding such use.” A technology that is far from being a threat is artificial intelligence. Yet it is stirring deep fears. AI is, today, is nothing more than brute force computing, with superfast computers crunching massive amounts of data. Yet it is advancing so fast that tech luminaries such as Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking worry it will evolve beyond human capability and become an existential threat to mankind. Others fear that it will create wholescale unemployment. Scientists are trying to come to a consensus about how AI can be used in a benevolent way, but as with CRISPR, how can you regulate something that anyone, anywhere, can develop? And soon, we will have robots that serve us and become our companions. These too will watch everything that we do and raise new legal and ethical questions. They will evolve to the point that they seem human. What happens then, when a robot asks for the right to vote or kills a human in self-defense? Thomas Jefferson said in 1816, “Laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.” But how can our policy makers and institutions keep up with the advances when the originators of the technologies themselves can’t? There is no answer to this question.	388	"[{""start"": 624, ""end"": 787, ""text"": ""This is a prelude of things to come, not only with encryption technologies, but everything from artificial intelligence to drones, robotics, and synthetic biology."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4043, ""end"": 4174, ""text"": ""CRISPR–Cas9 is a system for engineering genomes that was simultaneously developed by teams of scientists at different universities."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4175, ""end"": 4536, ""text"": ""his technology, which has become inexpensive enough for labs all over the world to use, allows the editing of genomes—the basic building blocks of life.

The promise of new CRISPR gene-editing technology has always been that it might lead to a cure for specific genetic diseases. Recently published findings from a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass., suggest that a modified form of this CRISPR gene-editing technology may eventually result in a cure for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a form of the disease that leads to progressive muscular degeneration in the face, shoulder blades and upper arms. The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you “turn off” the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene. As Dr. Charis Himeda of the University of Massachusetts Medical School told me in a conversation, this technique is a “non-cutting version of CRISPR” that involves the dCas9 protein rather than the Cas9 protein. The difference between “Cas9” and “dCas9” may sound like a case of arcane biological semantics for non-scientists, but the implications are actually quite important, says Dr. Himeda. That’s because researchers are not actually “editing” the gene, they are simply turning off something that should have been repressed in the first place. It turns out that DUX4 appears quite frequently as part of a repetitive DNA sequence known as D4Z4. In most cases, the size of the D4Z4 repeat is long enough that the gene is properly repressed. If the D4Z4 repeat is not long enough, however, the DUX4 gene is not repressed – and that’s what causes all the problems for the estimated 870,000 patients worldwide who suffer from FSHD. Bottom line: if the human body is not repressing a gene by itself, there needs to be a way to go in manually and switch it off. That’s the power of CRISPR. There are several reasons why the research being carried out by the University of Massachusetts Medical School is especially promising. This is the first study to show that the repeat genome can be effectively targeted using CRISPR technology, the first use of CRISPR inhibition for a human disease, and the first use of CRISPR technology in primary human muscle cells. In the article describing the work in Molecular Therapy, co-authors Charis Himeda, Takako Jones and Peter Jones highlight the important implications for similar types of genetic diseases: “With increasing evidence that the repeat genome (comprising nearly half the human genome) plays important roles in gene regulation, additional diseases will likely be found associated with aberrant repetitive genomic sequences,” they write. “We have provided the first evidence that the repeat genome can be targeted via the CRISPR system, which is likely to prove useful as this hitherto overlooked portion of the genome is decoded.” While the promise of finding a treatment for any genetic disease is certainly a plus, there are obvious reasons for caution with any “cutting” version of the CRISPR technique. Anytime people hear about cutting and snipping DNA, people are going to be concerned, even if you’re potentially discovering a cure for a disease. That’s why the researchers focused on the “non-cutting” version. As Dr. Himeda explained to me, “Cutting a repeat sequence that is present in hundreds of nearly identical copies could be very dangerous or even catastrophic for a cell.” Ultimately, that’s an issue that any of the new era of genome-editing companies – among them Editas Medicine, Sangamo Biosciences, Intellia Therapeutics and CRISPR Therapeutics — must confront as they search for cures. Anytime you’re altering gene expression in humans, there’s a risk that something might go wrong in a completely unexpected way. Yet, investors do not seem to be dissuaded. In August, a group of investors led by Fidelity Investments and a fund backed by Bill Gates poured $120 million into Editas Medicine, the Cambridge-based biotech start-up that is using CRISPR techniques to develop cures for more than 5,000 different genetic diseases. Since its launch in November 2013, Editas has been licensing genome-editing technologies from researchers at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute of MIT. For now, the University of Massachusetts Medical School researchers plan to concentrate on continued basic scientific research to further refine their modified CRISPR technique. Any plans for clinical trials are “years away” at best. While Dr. Himeda says she hasn’t yet given it serious consideration, it’s possible to imagine a theoretical scenario in which a company such as Editas Medicine licenses CRISPR technologies to develop a medical cure for FSHD. Going forward, it’s easy to see how greater knowledge of the human genome – knowing which gene does what as well as its precise location within the genome – has enormous potential. While CRISPR was once just a lab technique a few years ago, there now exists growing hope that further CRISPR innovation will eventually lead to treatments for a growing number of genetic diseases where researchers have pinpointed exactly which gene (or genes) is causing the problem.	387	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 124, ""text"": ""e promise of new CRISPR gene-editing technology has always been that it might lead to a cure for specific genetic diseases"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 126, ""end"": 516, ""text"": ""tly published findings from a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass., suggest that a modified form of this CRISPR gene-editing technology may eventually result in a cure for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a form of the disease that leads to progressive muscular degeneration in the face, shoulder blades and upper arms"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1979, ""end"": 2348, ""text"": ""There are several reasons why the research being carried out by the University of Massachusetts Medical School is especially promising.

"Luciferase: Few people could say what it is, but just about anyone venturing outside on a summer night would be familiar with it. It's the protein that makes fireflies glow, and a group of researchers thinks it will someday be used to detect cancer and other diseases. The concept is pretty simple. Proteins essentially act like keys in the body. Their unique shape and structures are designed to attach to specific molecules in the body and cause reactions to take place — like giving off light in fireflies. A group of Swiss scientists, whose work was published Wednesday in Nature Communications, took the protein from the insects and added a chemical tag so that when it attaches to another molecule, like one on a tumor cell, it will glow. [After her husband’s Parkinson’s diagnosis, she invented a product to improve the lives of millions] The goal is to use these designed proteins to make it faster and cheaper for doctors to diagnose their patients, potentially cutting out expensive readout devices. Scientists, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Laussane also say it's a highly accurate detection system because the light signal could be seen with a naked eye. ""You can think of the tagged luciferase as a cyborg molecule,"" said Kai Johnsson, a professor at the Institute, in a statement. ""Half bio, half synthetic ... With this chemical trick, all we have to worry about is designing an appropriate tag that can recognize the target protein."" Johnsson and his colleagues have already used the concept to develop a molecule that monitors drug use, leading to the creation of a startup company called Lucentix in 2014. The young company is developing test strips that allows people to analyze a drop of blood or spit with the modified proteins. They haven't had any products hit the market yet, but the hope is that someday doctors could quickly be able to tell how much of a drug someone has in his or her system by the color that the strips glow. The researchers think ""biosensors"" and the concept of taking advantage of luminescence could have applications throughout medicine, although it would take more research to create a product that's ready for use. Johnsson said that will probably take another two to three years. [Breakthrough HIV study could change course of treatment for millions] But the medical side of the research is just one part of the puzzle. Scientists are just now detailing the steps needed for proteins to glow during bioluminescence — something that's been a mystery for decades. A group of researchers from Connecticut College and Yale University published a study this week in the Journal of the American Chemical Society that shows the light is the result of a highly reactive molecule, called superoxide ion. It's generally toxic to animals, but it doesn't hurt fireflies because when it reacts and lets off light, it's contained and only happens for a short amount of time. ""We've made a basic scientific advance,"" said Bruce Branchini, a professor at Connecticut College who led a team reproducing the firefly's glow in a lab. ""We hope this will improve practical applications in biomedications.""

Cool apps Inside Einstein’s brain NMHMC Harvey, iPad app In 1955, just after Albert Einstein died, Princeton Hospital pathologist Thomas Harvey removed the famous physicist’s brain during an autopsy, sliced it up into roughly 170 parts, plunked them in formaldehyde and mounted them on slides, thus preserving the organ for posterity. Since then, some of those slices have been scanned and digitized to allow for easier access by researchers. Now everyone with an iPad can draw their own conclusions. Last week, Apple released an app, NMHMC Harvey, that allows users to check out all of the slides that have been digitized so far; more are on the way. (Profits from the sale of the app, which costs $9.99, will go to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring and its satellite in Chicago.) The app allows users to select slides from different sections of Einstein’s brain and zoom in to examine them at a microscopic level. What’s there to see? To a layperson’s eye, it may just look like a whole bunch of gray matter, but it is a chance to get an up-close look at an important if slightly gross piece of history. Playing with genes Forever young Discover, October edition In this month’s issue of Discover, Harvard genetics professor George Church and science writer Ed Regis propose methods that scientists might use to increase our life span by tweaking the human genome. Among them: cloning stem cells and using them to regenerate organs as they wear out, and reprogramming viruses so that they smuggle beneficial genetic information into our cells. “Ultimately, synthetic biology could free us from obsolete limits set by evolution,” they write. “We could repair damaged tissue and direct growth of new tissue to create built-in body and brain parts that could interface with electronic devices.” And what to do when the world becomes crowded with an emerging population of semi-immortal beings? Don’t worry about it. “The vision of a nearly immortal populace squelching the job prospects of youth is reminiscent of 19th-century Luddite concerns about machines taking over jobs for humans,” the authors explain in the article, which is adapted from their book “Regenesis,” to be published next month. “The likelier scenario is a population implosion marked by increasing numbers of older, healthier citizens, and more women in positions of power, a situation that could be beneficial for child rearing, philanthropy, diplomacy, and other aspects of our civilized life.” — Aaron Leitko	385	"[{""start"": 512, ""end"": 651, ""text"": ""Apple released an app, NMHMC Harvey, that allows users to check out all of the slides that have been digitized so far; more are on the way."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1393, ""end"": 1667, ""text"": ""Among them: cloning stem cells and using them to regenerate organs as they wear out, and reprogramming viruses so that they smuggle beneficial genetic information into our cells. “Ultimately, synthetic biology could free us from obsolete limits set by evolution,” they write"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1670, ""end"": 1819, ""text"": ""We could repair damaged tissue and direct growth of new tissue to create built-in body and brain parts that could interface with electronic devices.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	393	2023-03-31T11:56:10.972079Z	2023-03-31T11:57:55.150717Z	535.561
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a goal that’s even more ambitious than connecting the entire world to the Internet: He and his wife want to help wipe out all disease by the end of this century. Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are committing $3 billion over the next 10 years to speed up basic scientific research, including the creation of research tools — from software to hardware to yet-undiscovered techniques — they hope will ultimately lead to scientific breakthroughs, the way the microscope and DNA sequencing have in generations past. The goal, which they are unlikely to live to see accomplished, is to “cure, prevent or manage all disease” in the next 80 or so years. They acknowledge that this might sound a crazy, but point to how far medicine and science have come in the past century — with vaccines, statins for heart disease, chemotherapy and so on — after thousands of years with little progress. “So if you even just assume that we’ll be able to continue to make progress on that same trajectory, then that implies that by the end of this century we will have been able to solve most of these types of things,” Zuckerberg said in an interview. He and Chan have spent the past two years speaking to scientists and other experts to plan the endeavor. He emphasized “that this isn’t something where we just read a book and decided we’re going to do.” Through their charitable organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the commitment includes $600 million to fund a new research center in San Francisco, California, where scientific and medical researchers will work alongside engineers on long-term projects spanning years or even decades. The goal is not to focus narrowly on specific diseases, such as bone cancer or Parkinson’s disease, but rather to do basic research. One example: a cell atlas that maps out all the different types of cells in the body to help researchers create various types of drugs. Chan’s work as a pediatrician seems to be a big driver in their couple’s decision to take up this latest cause. “I’ve been with families where we’ve hit the limit of what’s possible through medicine and science,” Chan said. The couple spoke with the Associated Press in their home in Palo Alto, California, where their infant daughter, Max, had just woken from a nap. Zuckerberg and Chan hope that their effort will inspire other far-reaching efforts and collaboration in science, medicine and engineering, so that basic research is no longer relegated to the margins. “We spend 50 times more on health care treating people who are sick than we spend on science research [to cure] diseases so that people don’t get sick in the first place,” Zuckerberg said. Eric Lander, a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard, said he’s had some 20 conversations with Zuckerberg and Chan over the past year about the initiative and called their goal “the right kind of goal for thinking about that kind of time frame.” He is not involved with the project itself but expressed confidence in it. Zuckerberg said the couple decided to focus on creating better tools because this is where they see need, based on their conversations with scientists. It will probably take years for the first tools to be developed through this initiative, and even longer before they are used to cure diseases. Zuckerberg and Chan, who have pledged to donate 99 percent of their wealth, have spent the past two years meeting with experts to come up with the project. The two stressed that they believe that their goal can be accomplished, if not in their lifetime, then in their child’s lifetime. It was Max’s birth last November that inspired the billionaire couple to give away nearly all their money to help solve the world’s problems.	384	"[{""start"": 195, ""end"": 541, ""text"": ""Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are committing $3 billion over the next 10 years to speed up basic scientific research, including the creation of research tools — from software to hardware to yet-undiscovered techniques — they hope will ultimately lead to scientific breakthroughs, the way the microscope and DNA sequencing have in generations past"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1366, ""end"": 1657, ""text"": ""rough their charitable organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the commitment includes $600 million to fund a new research center in San Francisco, California, where scientific and medical researchers will work alongside engineers on long-term projects spanning years or even decades"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	392	2023-03-31T11:48:56.424453Z	2023-03-31T11:48:56.424561Z	225.003
Defense contractor Northrop Grumman and the University of Maryland Baltimore County are teaming to analyze the health data of people suffering various maladies with the goal of improving medical care, the company announced Tuesday. The five-year program, supported by about $600,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation, builds on a cybersecurity partnership between the university and the Falls Church-based contractor. The grants support big data-analytics projects to advance science and technology. Using the same tools that were developed to analyze cyberthreats and security risks, Northrop and the university plan to study electronic health records to gain insights on diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease, said Amy Caro, vice president and general manager of Northrop’s health division. Researchers plan to analyze decades’ worth of medical information from millions of patients in public and private databases, said Yelena Yesha, who is leading the project and is a professor of computer science at the university. This isn’t Northrop Grumman’s first health-related partnership. The company teamed with Johns Hopkins University in 2013 to set up a business accelerator for health-care start-ups. The defense company’s experience in data mining and keeping information secure for government and commercial clients can also be applied to health-care analytics, Caro said. Another focus area for the group is precision medicine — health care tailored to an individual’s genetic makeup — which many defense contractors, including Northrop and Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin, see as a growing business. By studying genetic data for large populations, health-care workers aim to spot trends and design more-effective treatments, said Sam Shekar, Northrop’s chief medical officer. The company has combined its analytics software with a cloud-computing platform designed by Google to analyze large volumes of genetic data for researchers. The same technology will be used in the partnership. Lockheed announced a similar venture with California genome sequencing company Illumina last year to study the human genome. Northrop plans to use the research to bolster its health-care offerings for clients, Caro said.	383	"[{""start"": 232, ""end"": 511, ""text"": ""The five-year program, supported by about $600,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation, builds on a cybersecurity partnership between the university and the Falls Church-based contractor.

"At many of the nation's leading cancer centers, doctors have begun to sequence the DNA of their patients' tumors to better personalize their treatments. That information has saved a growing number of lives. It might tell you, for instance, whether a certain type of chemotherapy may be extra toxic for a particular individual or if a different drug that no one ever thought of may be the miracle you were praying for. The problem is: This approach doesn’t scale. Today, figuring out how genetic mutations may impact a patient's response to a treatment is a time-consuming and manual process. It often involves a team of a half-dozen or more experts combing through hundreds of journal articles and consulting with colleagues around the world for a month. Even then, there's no guarantee that this will lead to useful information for the patient. With more than 1.69 million Americans predicted to be diagnosed with cancer this year, there will likely only be a lucky few whose oncologists have the expertise, time and access to do this. The rest will be treated by doctors who have only as little as 15 minutes to make their treatment decisions. IBM and the New York Genome Center are hoping to change this by partnering in a project that uses Watson, the computer superbrain of ""Jeopardy!"" fame. As part of the White House Precision Medicine Initiative, on Thursday the organizations announced the creation of a national cancer tumor repository that they hope will pinpoint in a very broad way which genetic characteristics correspond to how people might react to the universe of all the treatments available. ""Our goal is to take that massive data and turn it into information that can be used for a patient who is waiting at the bedside,"" Robert Darnell, chief executive and founding director of the New York Genome Center, said in an interview. The initial project will begin with 200 patients being treated at New York City-area hospitals, such as Memorial Sloan Kettering and Columbia-Presbyterian. Recruitment of patients begins immediately and is focusing on the neediest patients who have not responded to multiple treatments. Unlike smaller precision medicine projects that focus on 30 to 50 genes, the IBM-New York Genome Center effort will involve whole genome sequencing of the estimated 22,000 genes in the body and look at many different aspects of DNA. Steve Harvey, vice president for IBM Watson Health, explained that one way to understand the importance of the difference is by thinking about the iPhone camera, which typically generates a 3 megapixel image that is 2,000 by 1,500 little dots or 3 million bits of information. If that was the whole genome, he said, the genetic sequencing typically done at hospitals and direct-to-consumer companies only generates 3,000 of those dots. ""The resolution would be almost uninterpretable,"" Harvey said. ""To really understand cancer, you would need to have the 3 million dots, which is what we are trying to do with the human body."" One aspect of the analysis will involve comparing DNA from tumor cells with DNA from other parts of the body. Darnell said the DNA in the different cells in a person's body should be almost identical except for the parts that are ""broken"" in cancer. The amount of data generated and analyzed for each patient could be more than 1 terabyte (1 million million bytes) — roughly equivalent to 2 million average-sized photo files.

The University of Virginia’s provost, Tom Katsouleas, once told me that less than one percent, by his estimates, of basic research is commercialized and that there may be as few as one near-term commercialization for every $10 million invested in fundamental research.  This is an awful waste, especially when America is undergoing a reinvention in which entire industries are being wiped out and new ones are being created. A broad range of technologies is now advancing at exponential rates and converging, impacting entire industries.  When computing, telecommunications, and consumer electronics converge, for example, we get smartphones, smart TVs, and augmented-reality systems. Computing, medicine, and sensors join to produce wearable medical devices such as the Apple Watch — which will transform health care—and Apple Research Kit, which will revolutionalize clinical trials. Uber has already disrupted the transportation industry with its GPS-based cellphone apps; Netflix has made mail-order DVD rentals obsolete with its use of storage and networks; and WhatsApp has decimated the SMS revenues of telecom providers with its mobile-data technologies. Corporate executives have no idea what to do to survive this tsunami of technology convergence; even the innovation models that they were trained on, such as Clayton Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma, have become defunct. The competition no longer comes from within an industry; it comes from elsewhere, and not having domain experts in fields such as synthetic biology, nanotechnology and robotics, most companies have no idea how to respond to these new threats. Universities, though, do have the experts. As a result of decades of government investment in basic research — in fields such as computing, medicine, sensors, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, robotics, nanomaterials, and synthetic biology — they have an abundance of talent and intellectual property. This is a goldmine for industry. Businesses that are under siege or are trying to expand into new markets usually look to buy start-ups or form partnerships with research universities. And some simply take what they need. What better place is there to acquire intellectual property and talent than the universities, after all? Uber wanted to urgently build self-driving cars, so it lured away more than 40 researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in January this year.  Being nice or ethical didn’t matter to Uber; it took what it wanted and then came back to the university with a relatively small consolation prize: $5.5M for a robotics faculty chair and three fellowships.  Apple was also found guilty of incorporating unlicensed microchip technology from University of Wisconsin–Madison into its iPhones and iPads—and was ordered to pay more than $234 million in damages. We will see much more of this in the next few years. If universities don’t cooperate, businesses will take whatever they can get — because they are desperate. In order to keep its researchers, academia will need to put aside its historical aversion to working with industry. Universities are better off forming industry partnerships to jointly develop technology, as Stanford and M.I.T. did in accepting $50 million from Toyota for research in A.I. and autonomous-driving technology. Several months after being raided by Uber, Carnegie Mellon University also agreed to partner with Google to turn its campus into a living laboratory for Internet-connected sensors and gadgets. Companies such as Toyota have been blindsided by technologies emerging from other industries; visionaries such as Google have realized that they can’t do everything on their own. So this is a win–win strategy. A huge opportunity exists to teach businesses about emerging technologies and have them fund research-commercialization efforts — if universities seriously rethink their traditional ideals of academic freedom and the sanctity of the industry–academia division. Such partnerships can make up for the declining government funding of academic research. And it doesn’t have to be a Faustian bargain. Both partners can benefit if the partnerships are structured in a meaningful way, as the partnership between Google and Carnegie Mellon is.  After all, Google didn’t hire away university researchers; it funded research and testing on campus. Stanford University figured this out long ago. (Disclosure: I am a fellow at Stanford’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance.) Its faculty members are encouraged to work closely with industry, and these collaborations have led to innovation on a grand scale in Silicon Valley, with the formation of companies such as Google, Hewlett–Packard, and Cisco Systems.  This, in turn, has led to an endowment of more than $20 billion through the donations that its billionaire alumni have given to it.	381	"[{""start"": 685, ""end"": 885, ""text"": ""Computing, medicine, and sensors join to produce wearable medical devices such as the Apple Watch — which will transform health care—and Apple Research Kit, which will revolutionalize clinical trials."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1675, ""end"": 1946, ""text"": ""As a result of decades of government investment in basic research — in fields such as computing, medicine, sensors, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, robotics, nanomaterials, and synthetic biology — they have an abundance of talent and intellectual property"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1675, ""end"": 1946, ""text"": ""As a result of decades of government investment in basic research — in fields such as computing, medicine, sensors, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, robotics, nanomaterials, and synthetic biology — they have an abundance of talent and intellectual propert"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	389	2023-03-31T11:31:56.086141Z	2023-03-31T11:31:56.086201Z	417.488
"Priscilla and I are so happy to welcome our daughter Max into this world!For her birth, we wrote a letter to her about... Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, December 1, 2015 It was the birth announcement to top all birth announcements. In telling the world about the birth of their newborn baby,  Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan also pledged to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares -- worth an eye-popping $45 billion -- to philanthropic efforts during their lifetime. It's probably telling that the first example they describe in depth is medical science. ""Dear Max,"" the 2,234-word open letter to their newborn daughter begins. ""Your mother and I don't yet have the words to describe the hope you give us for the future… Like all parents, we want you to grow up in a world better than ours today."" The couple, who met while attending Harvard University, said that they believe the world should be dramatically better for their child than it was for them. ""We will do our part to make this happen,"" they said, ""not only because we love you, but also because we have a moral responsibility to all children in the next generation."" In outlining their vision for how they would achieve this, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg, 31, and Chan, 30, a doctor, said they were focusing on two ideas -- advancing human potential and promoting equality. While they didn't announce any specific projects or donations for the effort that they are calling the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, they outlined personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities (in that order) as being priorities. Here's what they said about medical science: Consider disease. Today we spend about 50 times more as a society treating people who are sick than we invest in research so you won't get sick in the first place. Medicine has only been a real science for less than 100 years, and we've already seen complete cures for some diseases and good progress for others. As technology accelerates, we have a real shot at preventing, curing or managing all or most of the rest in the next 100 years. Today, most people die from five things -- heart disease, cancer, stroke, neurodegenerative and infectious diseases -- and we can make faster progress on these and other problems. Once we recognize that your generation and your children's generation may not have to suffer from disease, we collectively have a responsibility to tilt our investments a bit more towards the future to make this reality. Your mother and I want to do our part. Curing disease will take time. Over short periods of five or ten years, it may not seem like we're making much of a difference. But over the long term, seeds planted now will grow, and one day, you or your children will see what we can only imagine: a world without suffering from disease. [More on Silicon Valley philanthropy: Peter Thiel, eBay co-founder, on his quest to find the key to eternal life Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, author and wife of Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, on reinventing charity Sean Parker, Napster co-founder, on curing allergies] The couple has been generous -- and creative -- with its philanthropy in health care in the past. In October 2014, they donated $25 million to the Centers for Disease Control Foundation to help fight Ebola. ""We believe our grant is the quickest way to empower the CDC and the experts in this field to prevent this outcome. Grants like this directly help the frontline responders in their heroic work. These people are on the ground setting up care centers, training local staff, identifying Ebola cases and much more,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post at the time. ""We are hopeful this will help save lives and get this outbreak under control. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg and Chan donated $75 million to San Francisco General Hospital, a new public hospital, to help out with costs for critical equipment and technology. Chan, a pediatrician, has taken time off from her practice to start a private school in Northern California for low-income children that will give them access to free health care as part of their education. A number of their technology peers have also given generously to medicine and science. Napster co-founder Sean Parker's name is on a new center at Stanford University dedicated to finding a cure for allergies. Google co-founder Sergey Brin and his wife Anne Wojcicki, who are separated, have donated many millions to fight Parkinson's disease. And Peter Thiel, the eBay co-founder, has given grants to a number of scientists and medical tech startups that aim to extend human life. Zuckerberg and Chan's letter echoes some of the ambitious thinking about philanthropy articulated by other young, wealthy Silicon Valley couples, Cari Tuna and her husband Dustin Moskovitz in particular. Tuna and Moskovitz, who is also a Facebook co-founder and is estimated to be worth $9.9 billion, have also pledged to give away most of their wealth in their lifetimes and have said they are looking to make an impact that will benefit future generations. They have also highlighted science as one of the main areas they are exploring with their philanthropy in addition to U.S. policy, global catastrophic risks and international aid.

When we think of allergies, we typically think of the scratchy eyes and sneezing that are the hallmark of the onset of allergy season. But what if these allergies had more to do with the bacteria and microbes in your gut than anything going on in your head? That’s one of the findings that appears to be emerging from the work of the Human Microbiome Project, a multi-year, $100+ million project from the National Institutes of Health that is attempting to create a map of all the microbes in and on your body. There are literally tens of trillions bacteria, viruses and microorganisms that inhabit your nasal passages, skin, oral cavities and gastrointestinal tract. The problem is, we really don’t know what all these microorganisms actually do. The growing consensus, however, is that an imbalance in your personal microbiome can lead to some allergies and even certain diseases. Not surprisingly, the Human Microbiome Project has been likened to a similar type of project – the Human Genome Project – for its ability to tell us about what makes us uniquely human. Just as the Human Genome Project gave us a way of understanding how our genes work, the Human Microbiome Project seeks to understand how the genes of all the microorganisms tagging along for a ride on the human body work.  And, just as a number of companies – like 23andme – emerged from the research efforts of the Human Genome Project, we’re starting to see a new generation of biotech startups that are focusing specifically on the human microbiome. These companies are looking at ways to restore balance to populations of microorganisms in and on the body that, when they fall out of equilibrium, may lead to disease. Last June, one of these companies – the VC-backed Second Genome – received a major investment from Johnson & Johnson in one of the first big forays by Big Pharma into the microbiome space. As suggested by its name, Second Genome is trying to figure out the link between illness and the human body’s “second genome” (i.e. all the genetic material contained within the trillions of microorganisms in your body). And – for allergy sufferers – here’s the good news: Second Genome has appeared to isolate a link between allergic diseases and the bacteria living in your gut. What it means is that you may one day buy a drug from Johnson & Johnson that injects bacteria into your body to prevent allergies or minimize allergic reactions. Instead of buying an over-the-counter antihistamine drug during the peak of the pollen vortex, you’d buy a bacterial therapy pioneered by a microbiome company. At a time when some of us ingest probiotic yogurts to get a mix of the “good bacteria” in the morning, this is not as far-fetched as it might sound.   The building block of the “microorganisms causes allergies” theory is something called the hygiene hypothesis – the idea that we’ve gotten so good in Western society of ridding ourselves of all the nasty bacterial infections of everyday life that we’re inadvertently getting rid of some of the helpful bacteria that appear to help us maintain health. (Just think of how quick so many of us are to reach for the hand sanitizer these days or ask our doctors for antibiotics as examples of how Western society positively abhors bacteria.) As a result of this long-term trend, the immune systems of individuals in Western society are more susceptible to allergic reactions and problems like asthma since they’re losing some of the helpful bacteria along the way. In one study documented in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, children with less diverse gut bacteria actually appear to have a higher sensitivity to allergies than children with more diverse gut bacteria. Admittedly, the idea that bacteria in our guts play a key role in regulating aspects of human health is a tough theory to wrap one’s head around. (Even harder than the “selfish gene” theory proposed by the ever-controversial Richard Dawkins more than 30 years ago, in which he basically proposed that humans were being used by genes to replicate themselves for future generations.) It’s like we went to bed with one extremely beautiful genome, and woke up with a second, much uglier genome that’s an order of magnitude bigger than this first genome and co-evolving along with the first genome in strange ways. The next time your allergies act up, though, you’ll rethink who to blame — it may just be the tens of trillions bacteria we take with us everywhere we go.	378	"[{""start"": 2260, ""end"": 2580, ""text"": ""What it means is that you may one day buy a drug from Johnson & Johnson that injects bacteria into your body to prevent allergies or minimize allergic reactions.

In the cardiac operating room of the future, a surgeon may repair your damaged heart with personalized parts made to fit your precise anatomy — bypassing donor lists and immune-suppressing drugs. It sounds far-fetched, but in some ways this future is already here. Doctors use 3-D-printed models of organs and tumors regularly to educate patients and plan surgeries. Some printed body parts have even made their way into human bodies as dental implants, prosthetics, skull and facial reconstructions, and more. Researchers are also working to print out cells, blood vessels and other living tissues, and experimental studies have created, among other parts, knee cartilage, bones and an artificial ear. As costs decrease and discoveries accelerate, experts predict that 3-D printers will become routine tools for heart care, too. Optimistic scientists envision customized patches or even full-fledged beating hearts, ready to be implanted, an exact fit for the patient’s body. “I really think the 3-D jet printer is transformative,” says Daniel Jones, chief of minimally invasive surgical services at Harvard Medical School in Boston. “It’s going to change the way doctors talk to patients, how they plan surgeries and how they do surgeries. The sky is the limit in terms of applications.” Around since the 1980s and now available in basic versions for just hundreds of dollars at office supply stores, 3-D printers work by creating layers of material in skinny slices that stack up to create a three-dimensional shape. The technology has been used to manufacture eyeglasses, car parts, jewelry and more. Medical applications are also wide-ranging. All it takes is an MRI or CT scan or other image to create a three-dimensional blueprint for creating objects of any shape. Colors can be altered to make visualizing easier. Depending on the design and complexity of the machine, objects can be made with a variety of materials, including plastics, metal and rubber. In cardiology, 3-D models are, for now, proving most useful as educational tools. Like fingerprints, every person’s heart is unique, and every heart problem plays out in its own way, says Paul Iaizzo, associate director of the Institute for Engineering in Medicine at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. With help from detailed replicas, surgeons can plan more accurately and reduce procedure times. In the last year, Iaizzo says, his team has printed models of 17 children’s hearts with congenital deformations that required surgical repair. A young child’s heart can be as small as a walnut, so the team prints each heart four or five times larger than normal. The surgeons can then study the models, show parents what needs to be done and discuss risks. They usually print out an extra heart for patients to take home. “One of the most critical parts is discussing the whole thing with the family,” Iaizzo says. “It’s powerful and comforting for parents to really understand what the problem is.” The medical device industry makes frequent use of 3-D models to design and test new products, Iaizzo adds. His team has also printed hearts for medical students, surgical residents and physicians to study and even to use in artistic exercises. “Taking time to put a paintbrush in every crevice is really valuable,” he says. “It puts that anatomy in the brain in a three-dimensional way that never could have been done another way.” The technology of 3-D printing is so new that rigorous studies have not yet assessed how using it affects outcomes. But anecdotal evidence is powerful. When Harvard Medical School cardiac anesthesiologist and echocardiographer Feroze Mahmood began printing full-size replicas of patients’ damaged mitral valves, he gained a new appreciation for the complexity of the structure, particularly a Pringles-shaped region called the annulus that was impossible to visualize with two-dimensional images. Insights gained from handling printed valves have helped him and colleagues understand why a common treatment works for some patients but not others. He has now used the technology hundreds of times. “For most people, it is an ‘aha’ moment,” says Mahmood, who is researching the possibility of printing patient-specific valve parts that would be safe to use in surgeries. “What I foresee is that . . . we will be 3-D printing everything we operate on before surgery. Instruments, grafts and materials will all be customized and will be printed on-site.” Someday, surgeons may even be able to print customized patches for repairing hearts damaged by heart attacks, says Adam Feinberg, a biomedical engineer at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. His team is working both to grow heart tissue in petri dishes and to use 3-D printers to create soft, living structures by embedding cells inside gels that can be laid down in precise layers. Feinberg’s team uses consumer-level printers, which cost about $1,000 each, far less than commercial versions, priced at $100,000 or more. To encourage other researchers to accelerate advances, the Carnegie Mellon group is also using open-source hardware and software. “The challenge is to print something high-quality that re-creates the function of real human heart muscle,” he says. “It’s easy to make something that doesn’t work well.” Multiple teams of researchers are working on this kind of bioprinting task, which Feinberg says could help as many as 100,000 people a year who need heart transplants but face long waiting lists. He imagines 3-D-printed living heart tissue becoming available in as little as 10 years, although he admits that he could be a decade off. “It’s definitely science-fiction now,” he says. “But at least we’re getting to the point where it’s conceivable that it could happen.” Read more: This young boy could have dropped dead on the playing field What’s the difference between heart attack and sudden cardiac arrest?

One study That's makes this new development especially interesting: California-based Proteus Health Care is at work building tiny, embeddable digestible chips that would be able to tell doctors' when a patient has swallowed it: The swallowed sensor is linked to a skin patch worn on the patient's torso, which captures the report sent by the sensor. About the size of a grain of salt, the sensor has no battery or antenna and is activated when it gets wet from stomach juices. The skin patch records the digital message, along with the patient's heart rate, body angle and activity, and sends the data to a bluetooth-enabled device such as a phone or computer. Doctors would then be able to follow up with non-compliant patients. The Gates Foundation is now funding a study that uses the swallowed sensor to monitor tuberculosis patients in China, who need to adhere to a strict antibiotic regimen. The idea of monitoring medical compliance speaks to some larger trends in health care. You're seeing a lot more real-time and remote monitoring of patients everywhere from the homes of the elderly to corporate wellness initiatives, where pedometers can track how far each employee walks. They might mean we're getting healthier, and also that our health insurers, doctors and employers know a whole lot more about us.  	376	"[{""start"": 68, ""end"": 729, ""text"": ""California-based Proteus Health Care is at work building tiny, embeddable digestible chips that would be able to tell doctors' when a patient has swallowed it: The swallowed sensor is linked to a skin patch worn on the patient's torso, which captures the report sent by the sensor. About the size of a grain of salt, the sensor has no battery or antenna and is activated when it gets wet from stomach juices.

"Which technology promises to most dramatically change our lives? A plausible answer is artificial intelligence -- see part 2 of our series ""The Resistance."" But a lot of smart people would say biotechnology. Or maybe both, in a glorious scientific tango. Genetic engineering and molecular biology benefit from the processing power creating by the digital revolution. There's a convergence happening -- and this is arguably one of the biggest stories in the world right now. Not long ago I walked around Kendall Square with Juan Enriquez. He’s an academic, investor and co-author of “Evolving Ourselves: How Unnatural Selection and Nonrandom Mutation Are Changing Life on Earth."" The book's premise: We’re undergoing directed evolution. Darwinian natural selection is giving way to bio-engineering, both the conscious kind in the laboratory and as an unintended consequence of urbanization, changes in lifestyle, the domestication of animals and so on. There's a reason obesity, autism, asthma and other auto-immune diseases are on the rise; these are side-effects of how we are evolving in our modern environment. As Enriquez and co-author Steve Gullans write in their book: “Over the past century, as our species grew by billions, concentrated in cities, smartened, and domesticated itself and its surroundings, we became the fundamental driver of what lives and dies.” In Kendall Square, M.I.T.’s academic laboratories stand next to nonprofit research centers and private, for-profit companies like Novartis, Google and Microsoft. This is the home of the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard, a leading center of biomedical science. A short walk away are M.I.T.'s computer science and physics departments and various other temples of technological innovation. The place is thick with scientists and engineers, and you can bet there are a fair number of patent attorneys running around. [The Resistance, Part 1: Meet the digital dissenters] Technology isn’t simply something we decide to do as a hobby or profession; it’s pretty much intrinsic to who we are. If you had to explain to a space-alien scientist what kind of animal the human species is (beyond the obvious anatomical descriptions, such as “That part is the head”), you’d have to say we’re an animal that can’t stop making tools and changing our environment, for better or worse. Then, in turn, our new environment and our new tools change us. “Our genes have co-evolved with our inventions,” Kevin Kelly writes in his book “What Technology Wants.” “Technology has domesticated us. As fast as we remake our tools, we remake ourselves. … We are now symbiotic with technology.” That’s the big picture. A more immediate issue is what to do about CRISPR. Surely you’ve heard all about CRISPR, or CRISPR-cas9. [Scientists gather in Washington to debate the ethics of CRISPR] This gene-editing technique was developed by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and the Broad Institute. (Exactly who did what and when is the matter of a major patent case.). It offers great promise for treating diseases. But the technique also works as well on “germline” cells, which include eggs and sperm and embryos. That kind of editing is ethically problematic: Any changes in the laboratory would become heritable in the species. There have been gene-editing tools for decades. As George Church pointed out to The Post, a couple of thousand trials are already under way involving gene therapy that uses techniques other than CRISPR. But CRISPR is notable for being efficient and relatively cheap. You don’t need a multimillion-dollar institute to do this. CRISPR’s low cost opens up a new era of relatively easy genetic engineering, with all the attendant concerns. Those concerns fall roughly into two categories. First, mistakes get made. This is a precision science, but it's not a foolproof science. And the human genome is really complicated. It’s not like swapping out spark plugs. Second, although CRISPR might be used eventually to reduce the prevalence of, or even eradicate, terrible diseases, it could also be used for purely cosmetic enhancements, or to give certain people with money and access to technology an extra physical or cognitive advantage. Which could get creepy. [How CRISPR works] At the conclusion of the big summit on CRISPR in Washington last month, the scientists issued a statement saying that safety issues have not been fully addressed and that CRISPR for now should not be used on human embryos for the purposes of creating a pregnancy. But the basic research will go on. The ethical dilemmas of bio-technology have been discussed at least since teenager Mary Shelley wrote ""Frankenstein"" 200 years ago this year. See also H.G. Wells and ""The Island of Dr. Moreau."" This is a field with twin narratives -- utopian and nightmarish. There are obvious worries about the technology being used nefariously. Yet the therapeutic possibilities are tantalizing -- as Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Tuesday on The Diane Rehm Show. (I sat to his left, serving as Ed McMahon to his Johnny Carson.) Collins is among those who think we should proceed carefully. As we were waiting to go on the radio show, he told me, ""The human embryo is a special type of cell that ought to be considered different from any other cell type in the laboratory. It's a potential human being."" How far can we go before we’re monkeying with the basic nature of being a human? Some titanic figures in academia, including E. O. Wilson, Francis Fukuyama and Michael Sandel, have argued compellingly against radical changes in life spans, cognition, physiques. Collins advises humility rather than hubris as we go forward. ""If we're going to improve the human species, who is smart enough to decide what an improvement is?"" he said.

Changes in technology are happening at a scale which was unimaginable before and will cause disruption in industry after industry. This has really begun to worry me, because we are not ready for this change and most of our leading companies won’t exist 15–20 years from now. Here are five sectors to keep an eye on: 1. Let’s start with manufacturing. Robotics and 3-D printing have made it cheaper to manufacture in the United States and Europe than in China. Robots such as Baxter, from Rethink Robotics, and UR10, from Universal Robots, have arms; screens which show you their emotions; and sensors that detect what is happening around them. The cost of operating these is less than the cost of human labor. We can now have robots working 24×7 and doing some of the work of humans. Over time, these robots will become ever more sophisticated and do most human jobs. The manufacturing industry is surely going to be disrupted in a very big way. This is good news for America, Europe, and parts of Asia, because it will become a local industry. But this will be bad for the Chinese economy — which is largely dependent on manufacturing jobs. In the next decade, robots will likely go on strike, because we won’t need them anymore. They will be replaced by 3D printers. Within 15 to 20 years, we will even be able to 3D print electronics. Imagine being able to design your own iPhone and print it at home. This is what will become possible. 2. The reinvention of finance. We are already witnessing a controversy over Bitcoin. Many technology and retail companies are supporting it.  Crowdfunding is shaking up the venture-capital industry and making it less relevant because it provides start-ups with an alternative for raising seed capital. We will soon be able to crowdfund loans for houses, cars, and other goods. With cardless transactions for purchasing goods, we won’t need the types of physical banks and financial institutions that we presently have. Banks in the United States seem to be complacent because they have laws protecting them from competition. But our laws don’t apply in other countries. We will see innovations happening abroad which disrupt industries in the United States. 3. Health care. Apple recently announced Healthkit, its platform for health information. It wants to store data from the wearable sensors that will soon be monitoring our blood pressure, blood oxygenation, heart rhythms, temperature, activity levels, and other symptoms. Google, Microsoft, and Samsung will surely not be left behind and will all compete to provide the best health-data platforms. With these data, they will be able to warn us when we are about to get sick. AI-based physicians will advise us on what we need to do to get healthy. Medical-test data, especially in fields such as oncology, is often so complex that human doctors cannot understand it. This will become even more difficult when they have genomics data to correlate. Over the last 15 years, the cost of human genome sequencing has dropped from the billions to about a thousand dollars. At the rate at which prices are dropping, the cost of sequencing will be close to zero in a few years and we will all have our genomes sequenced. When you combine these data with the medical-sensor data that the tech companies are collecting on their cloud platforms, we will have a medical revolution.  We won’t need doctors for day-to-day medical advice any more.  Robotic surgeons will also do the most sophisticated surgeries. We’re going to disrupt the entire health-care system. 4. Now take the energy industry. Five years ago, we were worried about America running out of oil; today we’re talking about Saudi America — because of fracking. Yes, fracking is a harmful technology; nevertheless it has allowed America to become energy independent and will soon make it an energy exporter. And then there is solar energy, which some people have become negative about. But it is a fact solar prices have dropped about 97 percent over the past 35 years, and, at the rate at which solar is advancing, by the end of this decade we will achieve grid parity across the United States. Grid parity means it’s cheaper to produce energy at home on your solar cells than to buy it from utilities. Move forward another 10 or 20 years, and it will costs a fraction as much to produce your own energy as to buy it from the grid.  This means that the utility companies will be in serious trouble. This is why they are beginning to fight the introduction of solar. If solar keeps advancing in the way it is, it will eclipse the fossil-fuel industry. Solar is only one of maybe a hundred advancing technologies that could disrupt the energy industry. When we have unlimited energy, we can have unlimited clean water, because we can simply boil as much ocean water as we want. We can afford to grow food locally in vertical farms. This can be 100 percent organic, because we won’t need insecticides in the sealed farm buildings. Imagine also being able to 3D print meat and not having to slaughter animals. This will transform and disrupt agriculture and the entire food-production industry. 5. Communications. Yes, even this industry will be disrupted. Note how AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint have seen their landline businesses disappear. These were replaced by mobile—which is now being replaced by data. When I travel abroad, I don’t make long-distance calls any more, because I just call over Skype. Soon we will have WiFi everywhere, thanks to the competition between companies such as AT&T and Google to provide superfast Internet access. We will be able to make free calls over open WiFi networks. *** In practically every industry that I look at, I see a major disruption happening. I know the world will be very different 15 to 20 years from now. The vast majority of companies who are presently the leaders in their industries will likely not even exist.  That is because industry executives either are not aware of the changes that are coming, are reluctant to invest the type of money that is be required for them to reinvent themselves, or are protecting legacy businesses. Most are focused on short-term performance. New trillion-dollar industries will come out of nowhere and wipe out existing trillion-dollar industries. This is the future we’re headed into, for better or for worse. This column was adapted from Wadhwa’s talk on Big Think, watch it below:	374	"[{""start"": 2201, ""end"": 2468, ""text"": ""Health care.

The controversial laboratory tool known as CRISPR may have found a whole new world to conquer. Already the favored method of editing genes, CRISPR could soon become a low-cost diagnostic tool that could be used practically anywhere to determine if someone has an infectious disease such as Zika or dengue. CRISPR — which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats — is basically a bacterial immune system that uses “molecular scissors” to snip away genetic material from invasive viruses. Early in this decade, researchers figured out how to exploit the natural system to craft a relatively cheap, remarkably easy-to-use technology for editing genetic codes almost as readily as using a word processor to revise a paragraph. On Thursday, Feng Zhang, one of the pioneers of CRISPR, and 18 colleagues published a paper in the journal Science showing how they had turned this system into an inexpensive, reliable diagnostic tool for detecting nucleic acids — molecules present in an organism's genetic code — from disease-causing pathogens. The new tool could be widely applied to detect not only viral and bacterial diseases but also potentially for finding cancer-causing mutations. CRISPR has been a sensation in the world of molecular biology, but the powerful tool has incited fears that it could be misused. Ethicists earlier this year released a report saying it should be limited in humans to treating diseases or disabilities, and with special caution when genetic changes would involve eggs, sperm or embryos and potentially be inherited by future generations. But CRISPR is already widely used in laboratory studies and has shown great promise in revealing the genetic origins of diseases, including cancer. This new application would propel CRISPR into the much less controversial realm of point-of-care disease diagnosis. The new study has a whiff of marketing about it: Zhang and his colleagues have named their new tool SHERLOCK — for Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing. “Nature is really amazing. Over the course of billions of years, it's come up with all these very powerful enzyme systems, and by studying the basic biology of these systems, some of them will give rise to important applications — like genome editing, like diagnostics,” Zhang, of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, told The Washington Post. Co-author Jim Collins, also of the Broad Institute, said, “In this diagnostic application we are really harnessing the power and diversity of biology. … I view it as a potentially transformative diagnostic platform.” In essence they have taken the virus-recognition properties of the bacterial CRISPR system and turned it into a technique for telling if someone's blood, urine, saliva or other bodily fluid contains genetic markers of a pathogen. The earlier gene-editing tool used a molecule called CRISPR Cas9, but this one uses another enzyme, characterized for the first time only a year ago, and now dubbed Cas13a. They report that their technique is highly portable and could cost as little as 61 cents per test in the field. Such a process would be extremely useful in remote places without reliable electricity or easy access to a modern diagnostic laboratory. “We showed that this system is very stable, so you can really put it on a piece of paper and it will survive. You don’t have to refrigerate it all the time,” Zhang said. “My head is spinning a little bit because this looks very, very provocative. And exciting,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new research. “If you had something that could be used as a screening test, very inexpensively and rapidly, that would be a huge advance, particularly if it could detect an array of infectious agents.” Collins said the scientists behind SHERLOCK have filed for patents on the technology, and are discussing ways to move their new tool from the laboratory to the clinical arena. Zhang is one of the key figures in the CRISPR patent fight between the Broad Institute and the University of California at Berkeley, the latter the homebase of CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna. The patent board ruled in favor of Zhang and Broad earlier this year. Doudna and another researcher had published their CRISPR discoveries first, but Zhang took the technique another step, into cells with nuclei, and the patent board ruled that the second step was sufficiently different that both could be eligible for patent protection. On Thursday, Berkeley and other interested parties filed an appeal of that ruling. Scott Weaver, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who was not involved in the new research, said after reading the study, “It looks like one significant step on the pathway which is the Holy Grail, which is developing point-of-care, or bedside detection, which doesn’t require expensive equipment or even reliable power.” Read more: Scientists debate the ethics of CRISPR Ethicists urge caution in applying CRISPR to humans Jennifer Doudna ponders “what it means to be human” on the frontier of gene editing  	373	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 93, ""text"": ""ersial laboratory tool known as CRISPR may have found a whole new world to conquer"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 515, ""end"": 750, ""text"": ""Early in this decade, researchers figured out how to exploit the natural system to craft a relatively cheap, remarkably easy-to-use technology for editing genetic codes almost as readily as using a word processor to revise a paragraph."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2593, ""end"": 3107, ""text"": ""In essence they have taken the virus-recognition properties of the bacterial CRISPR system and turned it into a technique for telling if someone's blood, urine, saliva or other bodily fluid contains genetic markers of a pathogen.

"Curious how many viruses have invaded your body over the course of your life? Now you can know. Researchers have developed a DNA-based blood test that can determine a person's viral history, a development they hope could lead to early detection of conditions, such as hepatitis C, and eventually help explain what triggers certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. The new test, known as VirScan, works by screening the blood for antibodies against any of the 206 species of viruses known to infect humans, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science. The immune system, which churns out specific antibodies when it encounters a virus, can continue to produce those antibodies decades after an infection subsides. VirScan detects those antibodies and uses them as a window in time to create a blueprint of nearly every virus an individual has encountered. It's a dramatic alternative to existing diagnostic tools, which test only for a single suspected virus. ""The approach is clever and a technological tour de force,"" said Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, who was not involved in the creation of VirScan. ""It has the potential to reveal viruses people have encountered recently or many years earlier ... Thus, this is a powerful new research tool."" [One day, doctors might prescribe viruses instead of antibiotics] Scientists on Thursday reported intriguing findings from their initial tests of 569 people they screened using VirScan in the United States, South Africa, Thailand and Peru. They found that the average person has been exposed to 10 of the 206 different species of known viruses -- though some people showed exposure to more than double that number. ""Many of those [people] have probably been infected with many different strains of the same virus,"" said Stephen Elledge, a professor of genetics and medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who led the development of VirScan. ""You could be infected with many strains of rhinovirus over the course of your life, for instance, and it would show up as one hit.""   In addition, he said, certain viruses were far more common in adults than in children, who presumably have yet to encounter much of the world's viral landscape. People infected with HIV tended to have antibodies against many more viruses than people without the disease. Researchers also saw striking geographic differences in the way viruses affected different populations. People in South Africa, Thailand and Peru generally displayed antibodies against many more viruses than people living in the United States. ""We don't know if this has to do with the genetics of the people or the strains of the viruses that are out there,"" Elledge said of the differences by country. ""Or if it has something to do with cultural habits or sanitation."" [Think you're healthy? You may be carrying around viruses you don't even know about] Elledge said the VirScan analysis currently can be performed for about $25 per blood sample, though labs might charge much more than that if the test becomes commercially available. He also said it currently takes two or three days to process and sequence about 100 samples, though that speed could increase as technology improves. Ultimately, Elledge said he hopes the test could be used to more quickly detect conditions, such as HIV and hepatitis C, which patients can carry for years before displaying any outward symptoms. Experts believe VirScan also could lead to insights about the role long-ago viral infections play in the later development of certain cancers and autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. ""There are a lot of chronic diseases where we think a virus might be involved, but we can't quite pinpoint it ... Right now we can't quite make the connection,"" said Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, who was not involved in developing VirScan. ""I think this is really going to be helpful. It's very cool."" Racaniello said he envisions a day when patients will get the VirScan test as part of a regular checkup. ""This is going to be routine, I think,"" he said. ""It'll be good to know what viruses have been in you.""

Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we’re talking about human genetic engineering. Jacob Corn is scientific director of the Innovative Genomics Institute and a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley. His research focuses on bringing about the end of genetic disease through the development and application of next-generation genome editing technologies. Find him on Twitter: @jcornlab The whole world is abuzz about CRISPR, the new technology that’s allowing scientists to easily edit genetic data. This development is poised to fundamentally change our relationship with genetic disease. In the future, we may be able to do more than treat the symptoms of genetic disease — instead, we might strike directly at the DNA causing maladies such as “bubble boy” syndrome, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell disease. But the biggest impact CRISPR will have on most people’s lives won’t be curing genetic diseases. It’s much larger: the widening of our horizon of discovery, which could lead to advances we can’t even imagine. [Other perspectives: What’s the difference between genetic engineering and eugenics?] CRISPR stands for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.” The obtuse name refers to the discoveries that enabled its development as a gene editing tool. Scientists first noticed in the late 1990s and early 2000s that many bacteria hold little bits of viral DNA (CRISPRs) within their own genomes. After years of intense research — work that was unrelated to gene editing — it was finally understood that these bits of DNA form part of an immune system that allows bacteria to fight off viruses. Specialized proteins form part of the bacterial immune system and use these bits of viral DNA to recognize and cut the genomes of invading viruses, protecting the bacteria from viral attack. By developing these proteins into easily programmable scissors that can recognize and cut other DNA, CRISPR became a hugely powerful tool for editing genomes for other purposes. CRISPR represents a triumph fundamental to research: Undirected scientific curiosity can lead to unexpected breakthroughs that improve our lives. CRISPR is able to dramatically accelerate biological discovery by “democratizing” gene editing. The tool gives scientists the ability to make new insights into the workings of life, for example, by testing how genes function during health and disease. The application of similarly fundamental biological discoveries has formed the cornerstone of almost every advance in human health, from new cancer drugs to cutting-edge cholesterol therapies. Gene editing technology has been around for a while, but earlier tools required relatively back-breaking effort, so few researchers did those kinds of experiments. CRISPR-based editing is fast and easy, and it’s now being used in all sorts of contexts to ask myriad questions in all realms of biology. This happens in settings with readily recognizable and easily applicable real-world benefits, such as human cells or agricultural crops, but research is also being done for the purpose of pure discovery on fish, field mice, butterflies and tiny crabs. Today, using CRISPR, we can make changes to genomic DNA and better understand what each element of the genome does. And what if some of that data leads to the next big unanticipated breakthrough? What if the field mouse gives us clues to treat neurological disorders? What if the tiny crab holds the key to the regeneration of severed limbs? We can’t know until we look, and CRISPR gives us the means to go looking. [What’s scarier? Tinkering with mosquito DNA, or malaria?] This opportunity to dive deep into biological systems that were previously impenetrable is the real power of CRISPR. And scientists realize it. By my last count, there are three new peer-reviewed publications that mention using CRISPR per day. And that number is only increasing. It’s staggering to imagine all of the amazing, completely unanticipated things that democratized gene editing will enable us to discover in the future. And as a new generation of scientists is trained with this kind of technology in easy reach, they’ll come up with even more creative uses and unearth more groundbreaking questions. CRISPR will change our relationship with genetic disease, but its ability to accelerate fundamental research also lets us learn much more about the biological world in which we live.

With the advent of synthetic biology and gene editing tools, there are amazing breakthroughs being made in medicine, energy and food. Within a few years, we will see cures for debilitating diseases, new biofuels, and grains that can be grown in extreme climates. We will also have many new nightmares: bioterrorism and well-meaning experiments that get out of hand. Imagine a superbug that can cure — or kill — millions of people or a virus which targets one person, say, a U.S. president. This is not science fiction; it is happening. In 2011 a scientist, Craig Venter, created a new life form by transplanting a computer-designed genome into the cell of a bacterium that had had its DNA removed. Today, a gene-editing technique called CRISPR is being used to engineer extra-muscular beagles, micro-pigs, super-goats, and ever-white mushrooms. Chinese researchers have edited human embryos. The cost of doing basic synthetic biology experiments is only a few thousand dollars, for lab gear and chemicals, and it is possible to design and order up DNA sequences on the Internet. We are not ready for the consequences of these technologies. We need to urgently develop new bio-defenses, rethink our laws, and bring together researchers from all over the world to solve the problems as soon as they occur. We can start by forming a global coalition to attack the Zika virus. Zika is propagated by mosquitoes and causes birth defects in infected mothers. It is likely to spread worldwide within the next year. The solution may lie in open-sourcing information — as leading researchers have recommended. In February, a high-powered group of health organizations including research institutes, academic journals, NGOs, and funding bodies published a public commitment to “sharing data and results relevant to the current Zika crisis and future public health emergencies as rapidly and openly as possible.” Signatories included journals Nature and Science, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. National Institute of Health. Said Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust in the statement, “Research is an essential part of the response to any global health emergency. This is particularly true for Zika, where so much is still unknown about the virus, how it is spread and the possible link with microcephaly. It’s critical that as results become available they are shared rapidly in a way that is equitable, ethical and transparent. This will ensure that the knowledge gained is turned quickly into health interventions that can have an impact on the epidemic.” Open science has been a topic of debate for over a decade. A growing number of vocal researchers have advocated that all research funded with public funds is open sourced, and not just the articles but the actual research data sets. The logic follows similar logic to open source software. When more eyes can look at data, it is less likely the data will contain errors — and solutions can be developed jointly. Just as in software, scientists anticipate that by open sourcing more medical data, they will enable more breakthroughs by increasing the body of pre-vetted knowledge and reducing the redundancy in research efforts. This type of information sharing did not happen effectively with last major epidemic that sparked global concern, the Ebola virus. When Ebola was raging through West Africa in the summer of 2014, a group at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. published open repository sequence data for 99 Ebola genomes taken from patients in Sierra Leone’s Kenema government hospital. This open sourcing of critical scientific data was the second instance in the outbreak. A team of international researchers had initially published three genomes from patients in Guinea in April. For the next three months, no more genomic data was released to the public data repositories that had become the go-to source for scientists studying Ebola. The silence puzzled many prominent scientists. A formidable array of genomic sequencing technology was aimed squarely at the virus. Yet the data was not shared. This delayed progress and troubled three of the most prominent Ebola researchers, Nathan Yozwiak, Stephen Schaffner and Pardis Sabeti. They published a plea for data sharing in the leading scientific journal Nature, titled “Make outbreak research open access.” Sharing data among researchers has long been a thorny topic. In the cutthroat competition to place articles in top scientific journals — the key currency in academic circles — researchers have traditionally held data close to the vest so as not to jeopardize the exclusivity of their findings and, by extension, article acceptance. Conversely, for pandemics such as Ebola and influenza, security experts have feared that publishing genomic data would allow evil scientists or regimes to stand on the shoulders of upstanding researchers and use publicly published genomics data to create equally or even more lethal pathogens that can kill millions. A decade ago, when sequencing genomes was incredibly expensive, tedious, and hard, some of the arguments for holding data closed did make sense. This provided a viable moat against rogue states and organizations. But today, the cost of DNA sequencing and synthetic biology experimentation has dropped to the point that anyone can do it; the bad guys already have the resources to unleash bioterrorism. The good news is that there are far more people in the world who want to do good than bad. We need to bring together the hundreds of thousands of scientists who want to use technology to better the world and solve critical problems. The best way is to create communities and begin crowdsourcing critical research.	370	"[{""start"": 134, ""end"": 261, ""text"": ""Within a few years, we will see cures for debilitating diseases, new biofuels, and grains that can be grown in extreme climate"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 536, ""end"": 696, ""text"": ""In 2011 a scientist, Craig Venter, created a new life form by transplanting a computer-designed genome into the cell of a bacterium that had had its DNA removed"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 698, ""end"": 844, ""text"": ""oday, a gene-editing technique called CRISPR is being used to engineer extra-muscular beagles, micro-pigs, super-goats, and ever-white mushrooms."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 892, ""end"": 1077, ""text"": ""The cost of doing basic synthetic biology experiments is only a few thousand dollars, for lab gear and chemicals, and it is possible to design and order up DNA sequences on the Internet"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 892, ""end"": 1077, ""text"": ""The cost of doing basic synthetic biology experiments is only a few thousand dollars, for lab gear and chemicals, and it is possible to design and order up DNA sequences on the Interne"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	378	2023-03-30T15:46:31.574645Z	2023-03-30T15:46:31.574846Z	467.324
Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week, we’re talking about transhumanism. Need a primer? Catch up here. Ronald Bailey is the science correspondent for Reason magazine and author of “Liberation Biology” and “The End of Doom.” “What ideas, if embraced, would pose the greatest threat to the welfare of humanity?” When the editors of Foreign Policy magazine posed this question to a group of prominent policy intellectuals in 2004, neoconservative thinker Francis Fukuyama chose transhumanism as the world’s most dangerous idea. In his response to the question, Fukuyama described transhumanism as “a strange liberation movement” that wants “nothing less than to liberate the human race from its biological constraints.” He isn’t alone in his alarm. This year, from the left of the political spectrum, Marcy Darnovsky from the Center for Genetics and Society warned that with the development of new effective gene-editing techniques “we could see the emergence of genetic haves and have-nots, with new forms of inequality and discrimination.” The prospect of technologically enhanced humans flourishing makes some people uncomfortable. The “bioconservative” alliance of moralizing neoconservatives and egalitarian left-wingers fears that the new bio-, nano-, and info-technologies threaten human dignity and human equality, but these egalitarian worries are overblown — and, in fact, they go against the liberal society that transhumanism’s opponents revere. Transhumanists advocate the advancement and application of modern biotechnology, nanotechnology and information technology to empower human beings to evolve and flourish beyond their current physical, cognitive, psychological and even moral limitations. One of the chief transhumanist objectives is to radically lengthen healthy human life expectancy, enabling people to thrive for hundreds, if not, thousands of years. On the horizon are technologies that can safely and comprehensively edit human genomes to cure illnesses and repair immune responses. Last year, researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine launched an anti-aging study using the drug metformin. Dutch researchers have recently shown that dosing fearful people with the anti-hypertension drug propranolol significantly reduces the emotional effects of bad memories. As rejuvenation treatments lengthen life spans, humans might achieve what theoretical bio-gerontologist Aubrey de Grey calls “longevity escape velocity,” in which advances in anti-aging technologies proceed faster than the people taking them age. Thus, life expectancy indefinitely lengthens. Others, such as futurist Ray Kurzweil, foresee digital technologies melding with human bodies. Think of something like cochlear implants that boost your intellectual processing power by wirelessly connecting your brain to banks of supercomputers. The enhancements that are likely to be available in the relatively near term will be pharmacological — pills and shots to increase strength, lighten moods and improve memory. Consequently, such interventions could be distributed to nearly everyone who wanted them. Later in this century, when safe genetic engineering becomes possible, it will likely be deployed gradually and will enable parents to give their children beneficial genes for improved health and intelligence that other children already get naturally. Can everyone afford such treatments? Consider that if the U.S. economy grows at a modest 2.5 percent annually until the end of the century, GDP per capita for 450 million Americans would rise to nearly $300,000, up from $55,000 today. In addition, compounding synergies between bio-, nano- and info-technologies will trace the steeply declining cost curves of today’s digital technologies — for example, Kurzweil predicts that the computing power equivalent to a human brain will cost about $1,000 by the beginning of the next decade. Thus, cheap and safe genetic engineering in the long run is more likely to ameliorate than to exacerbate human inequality. The Enlightenment project that spawned modern liberal democracies sought to keep certain questions about the transcendent out of the public sphere. To keep the social peace and allow varying visions of the human to flourish alongside one another, questions about the ultimate meaning and destiny of humanity were deemed to be private concerns. In our own time, technologies dealing with birth, death and the meaning of life need protection from meddling — even democratic meddling — by those who want to control them as a way to force their visions of right and wrong on the rest of us. Hostility to the prospect of technological enhancement must not be used as an excuse to breach the Enlightenment understanding of what belongs in the private sphere and what belongs in the public. One crowning achievement of Enlightenment humanism is the principle of tolerance, of putting up with people who look different, talk differently, worship differently and live differently than we do. In the future, our descendants may not all be unenhanced Homo sapiens, but they will still be moral beings who can be held accountable for their actions. There is no a priori reason to think that the same liberal political and moral principles that apply to diverse human beings today would not apply to relations among future humans and transhumans. The highest expression of human nature and dignity is to strive to overcome the limitations imposed on us by our genes, our evolution and our environment. Future generations will look back at the beginning of the 21st century and be astonished that some well-meaning and intelligent people actually wanted to stop bio-nano-infotech research and deployment just to protect their cramped and limited vision of human nature. If transhumanism is allowed to progress, I predict that our descendants will look back and thank us for making their world of longer, healthier and abler lives possible.

Frustrated at the lack of interest by the medical establishment in reducing the costs of diagnostic testing, and seeing almost no chance of getting the necessary research grants, Kanav Kahol returned home to New Delhi in 2011. He was a member of Arizona State University’s department of biomedical informatics. Kahol had noted that despite the similarities between most medical devices in their computer displays and circuits, their packaging made them unduly complex and difficult for anyone but highly skilled practitioners to use. As well, they were incredibly expensive — costing tens of thousands of dollars each. Kahol knew that the sensors in these devices were commonly available and inexpensive, usually costing only a few dollars. He believed that he could connect these to a common computer platform and use commercially available computer tablets to display diagnostic information, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of the medical equipment. He also wanted to repackage the sensor data to make them intelligible to technicians with just basic medical training — the frontline health workers who do the tasks of physicians in parts of the world where physicians are in short supply. Kahol and his Indian engineering team built a prototype of a device called the Swasthya Slate (which translates to “Health Tablet”) in less than three months, for a cost of $11,000. This used an off-the-shelf Android tablet and incorporated a four-lead ECG, medical thermometer, water-quality meter, and heart-rate monitor. They then enhanced this with a 12-lead ECG and sensors for blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, blood haemoglobin, and urine protein and glucose. In June 2012, they sent this device to 80 medical labs for testing, which reported that it was as accurate as the medical equipment they used — but more suitable for use in remote and rural areas, because it was built for the rugged conditions there. By January 2013, Kahol’s team had incorporated 33 diagnostic tests, including for HIV, syphilis, pulse oximetry, and troponin (relating to heart attack) into the Swasthya Slate and reduced its cost to $800 per unit. They also built a variety of artificial-intelligence–based apps for frontline health workers and started testing these in different parts of India. According to reports that Kahol shared with me, in Muktsar Punjab, the number of antenatal care visits increased from 0.8 to 4.1 per mother after the Swasthya was deployed there. The blood-pressure and urine-protein sensors allowed for the diagnosis of a condition called preeclampsia, which is responsible for 15 percent of maternal mortality in India. A year earlier, only 250 mothers were screened for preeclampsia, and 10 were confirmed to be preeclampsic. Because the detection was very late in the pregnancy, eight of these mothers nevertheless passed away. After the introduction of the Swasthya Slate, 1,000 mothers were screened during their third trimester, of whom 120 were detected to have preeclampsia. All were given the necessary care, and there were no fatalities. In March 2014, the Indian government started a pilot of 4,250 Swasthya Slates in six districts of the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has a population of 2.5 million. Antenatal testing, which often took 14 days because mothers had to go from clinic to clinic for different diagnostic tests, was done in 45 minutes in a single clinic. The proportion of the time that frontline health workers spent on administrative paperwork, recording data from tests and filling out forms, was reduced from 54 percent to 8 percent of their work day. Hundreds of thousands of people gained access to medical care that had been unavailable to them. Kahol believes that, in high volumes, the Swasthya Slate can be produced for as little as $150 per unit. This will surely make a difference in the developing world, where the ratio of doctors to patients is often as low as 1:50,000 instead of the 1:1,000 that the World Health Organization recommends. But it is needed in the United States as well. Such health kits will allow doctors to diagnose and advise patients remotely, through telemedicine, which is enabled by using technologies such as Skype and Facetime. If patients can take regular tests in the comfort of their homes and upload data to the cloud, it will dramatically increase the quality of health care they receive and reduce its cost. Continuous monitoring of health data by artificial-intelligence–based apps will enable the prevention of disease, especially lifestyle disease such as diabetes and cardiovascular illness. The Swasthya Slate is not FDA approved and may never be. The bureaucracy and time delays for testing sensor-based medical devices often discourage medical innovation in the United States. Instead, the device will have been tested by tens of millions of people abroad before finding its way to the United States. The results and data will speak for themselves. These are the types of innovations that we will increasingly see from entrepreneurs from all over the world. They will take advantage of technologies such as computing, sensors, artificial intelligence, networks, and synthetic biology — all of which are advancing at exponential rates and are available globally. The capabilities of these technologies are increasing as their prices fall. Our smartphones now have greater computing power than did the Cray supercomputers of yesteryear. Sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and blood-oxygen meters are now tiny microchips that cost pennies. These entrepreneurs will disrupt industries—not only in their own countries, but also in the United States.	367	"[{""start"": 311, ""end"": 1379, ""text"": ""Kahol had noted that despite the similarities between most medical devices in their computer displays and circuits, their packaging made them unduly complex and difficult for anyone but highly skilled practitioners to use.

Ethicists have been working overtime to figure out how to handle CRISPR, the revolutionary gene-editing technique that could potentially prevent congenital diseases but could also be used for cosmetic enhancements and lead to permanent, heritable changes in the human species. The latest iteration of this ongoing CRISPR debate is a report published Tuesday by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine. The report, a series of guidelines written by 22 experts from multiple countries and a variety of academic specialties, presents a kind of flashing red light for CRISPR. The report did not recommend an absolute prohibition of gene editing on the human “germline” if such interventions can be proved safe. This would involve genetic changes to eggs, sperm or embryos that would persist in an adult and could be inherited by future generations. For some ethicists, that represents a slippery slope. At the conclusion of a gene-editing summit in Washington at the National Academy of Sciences in December 2015, scientists said that although some basic research could proceed, it would be irresponsible to use genetically modified germline cells for the purpose of establishing a pregnancy. But the new report takes a slightly more permissive, forward-thinking position, saying that, if and when such interventions are proved safe — which could be in the near future — and if numerous criteria are met to ensure that such gene editing is regulated and limited, it could potentially be used to treat rare, serious diseases. “We say proceed with all due caution, but we don’t prohibit germline, after considerable discussion and debate,” said Richard Hynes, an MIT biologist and one of the leaders of the new study. “We’re talking only about fixing diseases.” The list of criteria for going down that road is a long one, said Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, speaking at a news conference Tuesday in Washington. For example: The intervention would have to replace the defective, disease-causing gene with a gene already common in the human species. There would also have to be no simpler alternative for parents wishing to have a healthy child. And first and foremost, there needs to be more research to show that such modifications are safe and target well-understood genes, she said. “We are not even close to the amount of research that we need before you can move forward,” Charo said. What is less controversial, and already happening, is gene therapy that targets “somatic” cells, in which the changes are not heritable. Such interventions can help an individual patient but would not affect his or her offspring. However, some therapies that can be used to treat a disease could potentially be used for purely cosmetic or competitive purposes. For example, gene therapy developed as a treatment for muscular dystrophy could potentially be exploited to make a healthy person more muscular. The committee came out strongly against any use of CRISPR for cosmetic enhancements. And the report argues that gene editing in humans should come only after broad public discussion. Josephine Johnston, director of research at the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institute, said the only thing potentially controversial in this new report is the “openness to germline modification.” Some bioethicists believe that's a bright line that should not be crossed, she said. Eric Lander, president of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said of the report, “It’s a very careful, conservative position that’s just a little bit beyond an absolute bar. And I think that’s the right place to go for now. … They say you cannot do this unless you put double-stick tape on the slippery slope so that nothing can slip. That’s a pretty strong set of restrictions.” Neither Johnston nor Lander were part of the National Academy of Sciences committee that issued the report. The report drew immediate criticism from a California-based non-profit organization called the Center for Genetics and Society. “This report is a dramatic departure from the widespread global agreement that human germline modification should remain off limits,” said Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the center. “It acknowledges many of the widely recognized risks, including stigmatizing people with disabilities, exacerbating existing inequalities, and introducing new eugenic abuses. Strangely, there’s no apparent connection between those dire risks and the recommendation to move ahead.” CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. CRISPR-Cas9, as it is more precisely called, is a natural system developed by bacteria over the course of their long evolutionary history. The bacteria use their own gene-editing system to identify foreign genetic material that has been inserted into the bacterial genome by viruses. These invasive genetic passages are snipped away, and the genome repaired. Early in this decade, a series of scientific papers described how this system could be exploited in the laboratory for genetic engineering. CRISPR quickly became the go-to method for gene editing, because it's easier and cheaper than previous methods. It can be used to modify the genomes of plants, animals and potentially humans, though experiments with human embryos have been limited so far because of ethical concerns and, in the United States, legal prohibitions. This story has been updated.

Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week, we’re talking about transhumanism. Need a primer? Catch up here. Ellen Jorgensen holds a Ph.D. in molecular biology and spent 30 years in the biotech industry before founding the nonprofit Genspace, the world’s first community lab. CRISPR is a controversial new technology for genetically engineering cells and making those changes heritable. It and other new gene-editing technologies have both raised hopes of speedier biomedical breakthroughs and concerns that they could eventually enable the modification of healthy humans. But what is not generally known is that the use of CRISPR as a research tool has already become so widespread that even community labs have access to it – and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For those not familiar with the term, community labs (also known as bio-hackerspace) are a relatively new phenomenon: grassroots, nonprofit organizations that maintain laboratory facilities open to the general public, with a mission to make the practice of biotechnology available to all. Anyone can come in and work on a self-funded project for a very low membership fee as long as it falls within generally accepted guidelines for biosafety. Within these spaces, citizen scientists have access to many of the same technologies used in university and corporate labs, including CRISPR. The movement has grown rapidly — in 2013 there were six groups, while today there are nearly 30. In 2014, the Wilson Center released a report saying that half of practitioners had joined the citizen science movement in the last 6 months before their survey. Will this have an impact on the transhumanist movement? That is, will it influence how people advocate the use of bio-technology to enhance the human species?  Lately, I’ve been fielding queries from the media regarding CRISPR use at my community lab, Genspace, and it’s become obvious that reporters are hoping to find someone attempting to genetically modify themselves or perhaps create a replicant or two. As far as I know, it is not technically illegal in the Unites States to genetically engineer yourself, but as in most endeavors, the devil is in the details. Editing a higher multicellular organism such as a human is vastly more complicated than altering single cells in a petri dish. CRISPR has been hailed as a breakthrough because of its ease of use and low cost, but these are relative to what was previously available. It’s still pretty hard to tinker with anything more complicated than a microbe, and of course we haven’t the slightest idea what genetic changes would be necessary to add wings or extra arms. Technically, delivering gene-editing technologies through the cell’s natural defenses and into the genome is always the biggest hurdle. Current gene therapies in adult organisms are confined to medically accessible tissues like bone marrow. Wholesale editing resulting in a heritable change in DNA code is only possible by manipulating early-stage embryos, so it is unlikely anyone will be doing this as a DIY project — or would seriously want to. I take heart in the fact that, while conventional gene therapy is growing as a medical practice, people do not attempt it in the comfort of their own homes. I don’t think the availability of CRISPR will change this. There is a deep-seated instinct for self-preservation warning us that, unlike an implanted device or machine-to-brain interface, genetic editing means seriously messing with your own source code, with potentially irreversible and unknown results. So why allow something as powerful as CRISPR to be used in a community lab? The first reason is that it is a very useful tool for run-of-the-mill experiments that involve engineering and studying lab-grown cells. For example, we can knock out genes in cell cultures and learn more about their function by doing so, or even create strains of harmless bacteria that bio-artists can use to make colorful fluorescent proteins. Just because it could potentially be put to work for “edgier” purposes does not mean that citizen-scientists should be prevented from using it. Second, there is a value in learning how gene-editing technology works firsthand by manipulating cells in a safe environment. The public is immensely curious about CRISPR. Our informational workshops are always packed; in fact, we started running them because we received so many requests. Empowerment through hands-on knowledge is particularly important for those — such as women and African Americans — who have not been served well by genetics discussions in the past. Public forums where scientists attempt to “educate” from a position of more knowledge can sometimes create hostility and an “us vs. them” dynamic, whereas participatory science does not. At Genspace, we believe the best way to understand biotechnology is to experience it through practice. CRISPR and other yet-to-be discovered genome editing technologies will be at the heart of the transhumanism conversation. Understanding will be crucial as society debates the social, moral and ethical implications of modifying our DNA and contemplating human enhancement. Explore these other perspectives: Charles T.

"Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, the immense promise of a technology that can reveal the 6 billion letters that make each of us who we are has loomed large as a way to revolutionize nearly every aspect of human health, from what we know about ourselves the day we are born to how to stave off the day that we die. But the ability to peer into the most fundamental biology of a human being has raised a slew of ethical questions and one that is even more simple: When is that information useful? If people are healthy, the answer seems to be not very often, according to a new, four-year clinical trial that exhaustively studied the use of genome sequencing of healthy adults by a primary care doctor, anticipating the day that this information becomes part of everyone’s medical record. Learning their genomic results didn't appear to harm anyone, but it also didn't provide any clear short-term health benefits — and it did drive up health spending compared to patients who simply got a detailed family history. Contrary to longstanding ethical concerns that people will suffer psychological ill effects by learning things they don't want to know in their DNA, people did not experience anxiety or depression in the six months after receiving the results. They racked up an average of $350 more in health-care costs, although the relatively small number of people in the study meant the difference wasn't statistically significant. And while 11 in 50 of the people who were sequenced found out they carried rare genetic mutations that put them at risk of a disease, that information had few health implications for the majority of the patients, who showed no signs of the diseases. In a few cases, patients might still develop those diseases in the future, but that was far from certain. And, reflecting the fluid and evolving understanding of DNA, one mutation that was reported back to a patient was reclassified and was no longer considered a risk factor by the end of the study. “My bottom line: big questions about the medical utility of whole genome sequencing in healthy adults, real concerns about the health care cost increases from doing whole genome sequencing in healthy adults, continued uncertainty about how the primary care docs are going to be able to handle this, and little comfort about the lack of harms if whole genome sequencing rolls out throughout the population,” Hank Greely, director of Stanford Law School’s Center for Law and the Biosciences, said in an email. Every new medical invention brings with it excitement around novel capabilities, whether it is a 3-D mammogram or a new kind of joint implant. That always comes balanced against the question of how it should best be used. But genome sequencing has traveled a particularly long red carpet of hype. Its medical uses are unusually diverse and it has been plummeting in price; the cost of sequencing and interpreting the genomes in the study was about $5,315, but today an interpreted genome costs about $1,000, according to Jason Vassy, a primary care physician and researcher at the VA Boston Healthcare System and Brigham and Women's Hospital who led the study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Add to that the fact this type of information is being sold directly to people, whether it is Silicon Valley’s 23andMe or a growing crop of start-up companies that seek to offer consumers medical advice informed by their genome. “Today, in 2017, for a healthy individual, I don’t recommend that any primary care physician order whole genome sequencing for that patient. But in a way this study kind of models what might be a more common scenario; the patients would bring this to us. The patient gets their whole genome sequenced; they ask us our opinion,” Vassy said. That doesn't mean people don't like learning about their biology. Renee DuChainey-Farkes, 63, runs a school in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. She eats a healthy diet and exercises, but was curious about her DNA and decided to sign up for the study. Her mother had heart disease and breast cancer, but she had also smoked. DuChainey-Farkes hoped she'd get into the group that got their DNA sequenced, but she was also nervous when she was picked. “It was like, 'Uh oh, what am I going to find out,'"" DuChainey-Farkes said. “You can always say information is knowledge, but if it’s not the kind of information I want, keep it away.” She found out she has an unusual blood type. She learned about her underlying risk for diabetes and obesity. She also found out that she has a rare gene mutation that causes a disease called variegate porphyria, which can cause blistering skin lesions and acute attacks that cause severe abdominal pain. She has never had an acute attack but had blistered skin as a child that was attributed to sunburn. She went to a specialist for a follow-up appointment to get baseline measurements done. That reassures her, because if she ever has an attack there will be information in her medical record about her risk for the disease. Although Duchainey-Farkes enjoyed the testing and felt like she learned a lot about herself, it's less clear how useful the information is. She's a fair-skinned redhead and has always avoided the sun. “It’s kind of like this secret I have. I don't know what to do about it,” said DuChainey-Farkes, who has been trying to get her young adult children interested in her findings. “I'm not going to get a really bad sunburn — I'm definitely more conscious of that.” Misha Angrist, an associate professor at the Duke Social Science Research Institute who has had his genome sequenced twice said that the study shows just how much effort is needed to create the infrastructure to provide this kind of information to healthy patients. He said it also hints at how much more research it will take to really gain any conclusive evidence on whether genome sequencing is ultimately useful for healthy people. “I imagine some people, especially people who are skeptical of this, will look at this paper and say, ‘You know, this is a nothing-burger,’ ” Angrist said. “I guess I would probably say I think it’s more like an hors d'oeuvres of a meal with many courses.” Peter Ting, 60, signed up because he was curious about whether the thyroid problems and diabetes that afflicted his family members lay in his future, too. His results were less than a revelation. Ting found out he doesn’t have a particular genetic predisposition for diabetes or thyroid disease, a fact that came as a relief. But the relief changes very little about his outlook: He still thinks he should continue his efforts to lose weight. Ting also found an explanation for a problem that wasn’t really a problem. For his whole life, he has had trouble adjusting from bright to dark environments; he’d be momentarily blinded, for example, when walking into a dark movie theater. When driving, he’d close one eye as he approached a tunnel, then open it once he was inside, so that one half of his vision would be pre-adjusted to darkness. Finding out the gene mutation doesn't change anything, other than learning his problem has a name: fundus albipunctatus. “It’s good to know, you know,” Ting said. “It’s not that important — well, it’s important that I adapted already.”"	364	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 331, ""text"": ""the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, the immense promise of a technology that can reveal the 6 billion letters that make each of us who we are has loomed large as a way to revolutionize nearly every aspect of human health, from what we know about ourselves the day we are born to how to stave off the day that we di"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 0, ""end"": 331, ""text"": ""Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, the immense promise of a technology that can reveal the 6 billion letters that make each of us who we are has loomed large as a way to revolutionize nearly every aspect of human health, from what we know about ourselves the day we are born to how to stave off the day that we die"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	372	2023-03-30T14:42:57.026722Z	2023-03-30T14:42:57.026790Z	443.151
Google is exploring the human body, hoping to develop a definition for a “healthy” person by cells and molecules. This ambitious project, which the company claims “has never been done before” and known as the Baseline Study, is being led by the Google X secret laboratory, Google said in a statement Thursday. The study is now in its pilot phase as researchers enroll 175 anonymous healthy individuals over the course of the summer. Study participants will go through exams similar to what they would receive from a primary care physician, including the collection of body fluids like urine, blood and saliva. “It may sound counter-intuitive, but by studying health, we might someday be better able to understand disease,” said Andrew Conrad, molecular biologist who is leading the study at Google X. “This research could give us clues about how the human body stays healthy or becomes sick, which could in turn unlock insights into how diseases could be better detected or treated.” This is not the first time Google has stepped into the health market. The company has also been developing a smart contact lens that can help monitor glucose levels in tears and automatically adjust their focus for diabetic patients. But the Baseline Study is is more extensive and potentially intrusive, particularly since it includes collecting participants’ genetic and molecular information. The company says it will use its enormous computing power to find patterns, or “biomarkers” buried in the information, potentially pushing medicine more toward prevention rather than treatment. For example, if researchers find a generic “biomarker” in people who break down fatty foods efficiently, researchers could check if other people lack such biomarker and help them modify their lifestyle to reduce the risk of having high cholesterol and heart disease, Conrad told the WSJ. Google said Baseline is intended as a contribution to science and is “ not intended to generate a new product at Google,” unlike other Google X products including the Glass wearable and driver-less cars. The company plans to make the study and research data available to qualified researchers in health-care fields, which is a fast-growing industry estimated to create 5.6 million new jobs by 202, according to a study from Georgetown University’s Center on Education and Workforce. There are also privacy concerns regarding how Google will use the data, including the entire genomes of the study participants and even their parents’ genetic history, which could be invaluable to insurance company who are always trying to reduce their business risks. Conrad told the Wall Street Journal that Baseline will be monitored by institutional review boards through the entire process. Medical schools at Duke University and Stanford University will control the use of information once the study is fully launched.	363	"[{""start"": 802, ""end"": 983, ""text"": ""This research could give us clues about how the human body stays healthy or becomes sick, which could in turn unlock insights into how diseases could be better detected or treated."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1054, ""end"": 1216, ""text"": ""he company has also been developing a smart contact lens that can help monitor glucose levels in tears and automatically adjust their focus for diabetic patients"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2066, ""end"": 2343, ""text"": ""he company plans to make the study and research data available to qualified researchers in health-care fields, which is a fast-growing industry estimated to create 5.6 million new jobs by 202, according to a study from Georgetown University’s Center on Education and Workforce"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 802, ""end"": 983, ""text"": ""is research could give us clues about how the human body stays healthy or becomes sick, which could in turn unlock insights into how diseases could be better detected or treated."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2066, ""end"": 2343, ""text"": ""e company plans to make the study and research data available to qualified researchers in health-care fields, which is a fast-growing industry estimated to create 5.6 million new jobs by 202, according to a study from Georgetown University’s Center on Education and Workforc"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	371	2023-03-30T14:35:28.883334Z	2023-03-30T14:35:28.883402Z	382.499
"This story has been updated. An elite panel of scientists and bioethicists offered guarded approval Wednesday of a novel form of genetic engineering that could prevent congenital diseases but would result in babies with genetic material from three parents. The committee, which was convened last year at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, concluded that it is ethically permissible to “go forward, but with caution” with mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRT), said the chairman, Jeffrey Kahn, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins ­University. But the advisory panel’s conclusions have slammed into a congressional ban: The omnibus fiscal 2016 budget bill passed by Congress late last year contained language prohibiting the government from using any funds to handle applications for experiments that genetically alter human embryos. Thus the green light from the scientists and ethicists won't translate anytime soon into clinical applications that could potentially help families that want healthy babies, said Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a pioneer of the new technique at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Ore. “It seems like the FDA is disabled in this case by Congress,"" Mitalipov said. “At this point we’re still not clear how to proceed."" The FDA released a statement Wednesday saying it will carefully review the report from the advisory committee, but added that the congressional ban prohibits the agency from reviewing applications ""in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification. As such, human subject research utilizing genetic modification of embryos for the prevention of transmission of mitochondrial disease cannot be performed in the United States in FY 2016."" MRT should be used rarely, with extreme care and with abundant government oversight, and it initially should be applied only to male embryos, the advisory panel said. The group delivered its report at a morning news conference at the National Academy of Sciences’ headquarters in ­Washington. The report comes at a time of dazzling advances in genetic engineering and a commensurate struggle to understand the ethics of “playing God,” a phrase uttered twice Wednesday by committee member R. Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin. Two months ago, scientists from around the globe gathered in the same building to hash out guidelines for the use of another revolutionary technique, known as CRISPR, which can be used to efficiently edit nuclear DNA genes. Earlier this week, British officials approved publicly funded research that will use CRISPR to study the development of early-stage human embryos, but the embryos will not be implanted in women. The FDA last year asked the Institute of Medicine, now part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, to review the ethical implications of MRT because it would result in what has been loosely referred to as “three-parent babies.” British officials have already approved investigatory experiments involving the technique. [One year ago, the UK voted yes on 'three-parent' babies] Certain serious congenital diseases can be passed from a mother to child via the tiny amount of genetic material contained in the mitochondria, which are small organs within a cell that are often described as the cell’s energy factories or power plants. New experimental techniques involving in vitro fertilization make it possible to replace mutated and potentially disease-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with non-pathogenic mtDNA donated from another woman. Mitochondrial DNA contains 37 genes and is distinct from nuclear DNA (nDNA), which in humans has upwards of 20,000 genes. The mtDNA is not found in sperm, only in eggs, and thus is passed only from mother to child. That is why the panel recommended limiting the experimental procedures to male embryos. The males-only guideline is intended to prevent the introduction of unwanted, irreversible genetic changes to the human species. Any genetic changes associated with this kind of engineering will meet a dead end in males. “If there are adverse events, they would not be reverberating down the generations,” Charo said. [Scientists debate the ethics of CRISPR, an unnerving new genetic engineering technique] The procedure should be extended to female embryos only after the long-term effects of such novel genetic engineering are better understood, the committee concluded. Nuclear DNA is by far the more significant form of genetic material for determining most human characteristics. As the committee put it, “While mtDNA plays a central role in genetic ancestry, traits that are carried in nDNA are those that in the public understanding constitute the core of genetic relatedness in terms of physical and behavioral characteristics as well as most forms of disease.” As a result, modifying mtDNA “is meaningfully different.”    But panel members said that they took the philosophical issues seriously, noting that someone with genetic material from two different maternal bloodlines would potentially have to wrestle with questions about identity, kinship and ancestry. They also countenanced the possibility that people would want to use this new technique to create babies that are enhanced in some way intellectually or physically. They said that is not a major concern at the moment because the feasibility of such enhancements remains speculative.

"Researchers at the National Institutes of Health announced Thursday that they have developed a device that puts a ""mini-placenta"" on a chip to better understand the organ's role in pregnancy, highlighting new technology that's showing up in labs across the country and may reduce the amount of animal testing over time. Studies like these are generally done on the micro level. Human cells are grown onto the chips, which look something like a computer flash drive and are designed to mimic the functions of full organs. The technology is said to be more accurate and less costly than studying human cells in dishes or similar cells in animals. ""I try not to hate on people doing animal experiments — we do that, too,"" said Roberto Romero, who has been studying placentas with the chip at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. ""But we can do this [with the chip] before we go to the animal."" In Romero's work, the device is cheap to make (about $10 a piece), and it's easier to study than mice — not to mention, there are some big difference between the placentas in mice and the placentas in humans. The chip takes about a day to make, with about a week to grow the cells. The NIH plans to use the technology to study the inner workings of the human placenta in ways never done before. The temporary organ found in pregnant mothers, described by Romero as ""completely understudied,""  acts like a ""crossing guard"" for substances moving from a woman to her fetus, according to a study released Thursday in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine. [See how scientists were able to create an ""egg-on-a-chip""] The researchers replicated the organ by putting maternal cells from a delivered placenta on one compartment in the device and fetal cells from an umbilical cord on another. They then tested how substances like glucose are transferred from the two compartments. Generally, studying the placenta is time-consuming and dangerous because it's risky for the fetus. But now the team at NIH — including researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, Wayne State University/Detroit Medical Center, Seoul National University and Asan Medical Center in South Korea — can figure out how different materials move across that barrier. Romero said that may lead to big discoveries for the health of children, such as how viruses and chemicals passing from mother to fetus can affect development. ""It allows us to ask many, many questions that are difficult to answer,"" he said. But the technology doesn't stop there. Institutions across the country are following up on the concept, pioneered at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University. Wyss has managed to put together a mini-lung, kidney and intestine on a chip, while the University of California-Berkeley has made a similar device that has live, pumping heart cells. Emulate Inc., a biotech company in Boston, also announced Thursday that it will be using the technology to recreate thrombosis — better known as a blood clot — to see how drugs can affect blood flow and the interaction of platelets. Don Ingber, director of the Wyss Institute, suggests that as the technology gains popularity, it will speed up the process for pharmaceutical companies to test new drugs for targeted populations. ""It's caught on because it's so visual and so meaningful,"" Ingber said. ""You're seeing some interdisciplinary interaction between engineering and biology.

"In March, a rumor surfaced in the scientific community that was intriguing, and perhaps a bit chilling: According to those in the know, researchers in China had successfully edited the genomes of human embryos, altering their DNA in a way never accomplished in our own species. MIT Technology Review reported on the murmurings that someone had altered the germ line -- the genetic information that come together and form something new when eggs and sperm collide. Even unconfirmed, those rumors led to a lot of debate about the potential downsides of altering the germ line. Carl Zimmer has more on the controversy at his blog on National Geographic. But it turns out the rumors are true. On Wednesday, Nature News reported that the paper in question had been quietly published in a low-profile journal called Protein & Cell. But no, you can't expect to see any genetically altered humans running around in the coming months, for better or for worse. From MIT Technology Review: The team did not try to establish a pregnancy and say for ethical reasons they did their tests only in embryos that were abnormal. “These authors did a very good job pointing out the challenges,” says Dieter Egli, a researcher at the New York Stem Cell Foundation in Manhattan. “They say themselves this type of technology is not ready for any kind of application.” The work,  led by Junjiu Huang of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, focused on modifying the gene responsible for β-thalassaemia, a blood disorder that can be fatal. They used CRISPR, a cutting-edge gene editing tool that's already made serious waves in the genome editing of other species. By going after genes at the earliest stage of human development -- in a single-celled embryo -- theoretically one can make sure all the subsequent copies of the gene are the superior version. But we have a long way to go before that's actually the case. From Nature News: The team injected 86 embryos and then waited 48 hours, enough time for the CRISPR/Cas9 system and the molecules that replace the missing DNA to act — and for the embryos to grow to about eight cells each. Of the 71 embryos that survived, 54 were genetically tested. This revealed that just 28 were successfully spliced, and that only a fraction of those contained the replacement genetic material. “If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%,” Huang says. “That’s why we stopped. We still think it’s too immature.” Indeed, not all of the embryos that successfully received the new gene had it throughout all of their cells. Many were mosaics, with some good copies of the gene and some bad ones. Carl Zimmer points out that this could end really badly: If a doctor tested the potential embryos of a couple looking to edit out a deadly gene mutation, they might take a cell sample that showed the embryo as having the healthy gene. If it was a mosaic, the resulting baby might in fact have enough copies of the bad gene to cause problems. And in some of the embryos, the gene editing caused unintended mutations in other genes. ""I believe this is the first report of CRISPR/Cas9 applied to human pre-implantation embryos and as such the study is a landmark, as well as a cautionary tale,"" George Daley, a stem-cell biologist at Harvard Medical School, told Nature. ""Their study should be a stern warning to any practitioner who thinks the technology is ready for testing to eradicate disease genes."" So it's an exciting first step, but nothing more. Science has a long way to go before this is something we can do on embryos intended for implantation, and some are already trying to discourage researchers from taking the next steps toward that goal. Even the study authors themselves are incredibly cautious about their findings, firmly reporting that the technique is far from ready. But you can be sure that such a caveat won't stop a lot of hoopla about the pros and cons of ""designer babies."" Want more science?

Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we’re talking about human genetic engineering. Brendan P. Foht is associate editor at the New Atlantis: A Journal of Technology and Society. Many worry that tinkering with human DNA could have unpredictable consequences for future generations, or even the entire species. However, we should also be concerned about the kinds of experiments that are being done on human embryos now — and how our concern for the future of our species might be distorting the way we treat human beings today. The emerging consensus among scientists and ethicists is that to keep the human germline safe, gene editing must not be conducted on human embryos that are meant to be used for reproduction, because genetic changes made to embryos may be inherited by the resulting children’s own descendants. This is what is meant by “germline modification” — the modification of the germ cells that transmit genetic information from one generation to the next. [Other perspectives: CRISPR will change lives, but not only through genetic engineering] Modifying the genes of embryos that are then destroyed is not germline modification, because the genetic changes are not inherited by future generations. Therefore, destroying embryos that have had their genes modified is thought of as a socially and morally responsible way to conduct research. The moral status of the embryo is by now a decades-old question in U.S. politics, one that has been closely tied to debates over abortion. But the position that scientists have a moral obligation to kill genetically modified human embryos goes beyond the justifications offered by proponents of abortion for killing unborn human beings. Some proponents of human embryo research have argued that the early embryo, unlike a newborn baby or unborn fetus, is not yet a human being — but they offer no plausible alternative to the moment of conception for when a human life begins. In the stem cell debates, killing human embryos was seen as a necessary step in generating embryonic stem cells; in the debates over abortion and some forms of contraception, the killing of human embryos was seen as necessary for women to exercise control over their own bodies. Stem cell researchers aim not to kill embryos, but to produce embryonic stem cells for potential medical treatments; women using contraception aim not to kill embryos, but to avoid pregnancy. In the case of killing genetically modified human embryos, however, scientists insist that these embryos must be destroyed as a matter of moral principle. The mandated destruction of genetically modified human embryos complicates the lessons we can draw from the moral disaster of eugenics. In the early 20th century, the eugenics movement meant to “perfect” the human species through “better breeding,” giving rise to the somewhat ridiculous spectacle of “fitter family” contests, and later, to harebrained schemes for collecting sperm from Nobel Prize winners. The eugenics movement was also animated by a terror that the gene pool was degenerating. This motivated some of the most shameful public policies in the history of modern democracy, particularly the compulsory sterilization of those deemed to be threats to future generations. Scientists and lawmakers were so concerned with protecting the human species from the specious threat of genetic degeneration that they were willing to trample the rights and interests of actual human beings. [What’s the difference between genetic engineering and eugenics?] Opponents of human germline modification often point out its similarities with the eugenics movement, in particular the dubious notion that gene-editing techniques can be used to perfect the human race by giving us control over our own evolution. In fact, many scientists and ethicists believe that it is necessary to destroy any genetically modified human embryo because of the eugenic implications of germline modification. But the idea that we must kill human embryos to preserve the integrity of the human germline bears a troubling similarity to the moral reasoning of the advocates of eugenic sterilization, who believed that killing individuals was worthwhile if it protected the human species as a whole. These scientists elevated abstractions such as the human gene pool above their obligations to individual human beings and families. A serious response to the moral challenges posed by gene editing would make scientists and doctors responsible not for abstractions, but to actual human beings — and especially to the patients of experimental gene-editing procedures, whether those patients be adults, children or unborn embryos. Gene editing in embryos is a dangerous form of experimental medicine, and because the research subjects — the embryos — cannot consent to the risks involved, it may never be possible to do this research ethically. But thinking that killing the subjects of preclinical research makes gene editing in embryos morally acceptable is a perverse inversion of the standards of research ethics, and of the obligations we have toward the most vulnerable.

"A futuristic gene-editing technology holds almost fantastical promise to turn biologists' wildest dreams into reality. The technology called CRISPR could one day be used to delete the HIV virus from patients' cells, create a limitless supply of organs for transplant and produce better crops. Already, it's being used in laboratories across the world. This week, the fierce battle over who invented it officially kicked off, with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line. A patent judge rang the opening bell Monday, pitching two heavyweight research institutions perched on opposite coasts against each other: the University of California Berkeley vs. the MIT- and Harvard-affiliated Broad Institute in Cambridge. The judge's declaration of ""interference,"" a technical term meaning that a conflict exists between a patent application and another patent or application, draws CRISPR, one of the hottest discoveries in biology, into a drawn-out, arcane trial process that will determine who invented it. CRISPR's bedfellows in interference include the telephone, the integrated circuit and the lockstitch technology used in the Singer sewing machine. ""These types of actions typically arise only in the context of very successful, very valuable patents,"" said Adam Mossoff, a patent specialist at George Mason University School of Law. ""This patent, in particular, is ... a significantly huge advance in gene-editing technology, and this type of technology is the core of what has made the biotech revolution."" Whether CRISPR will transform health as everyone hopes is currently uncertain, without even a single clinical trial started. But the tool is already so crucial to how science is done that it straddles an unusual cultural divide: named breakthrough of 2015 by Science magazine and also nominated for word of the year. CRISPR, short for the tongue-tying ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,"" is a clever hack of the way bacteria defend themselves against infections. In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier reported that they could reprogram this mechanism; instead of snipping invading viruses, they could use CRISPR to cut DNA very precisely, opening the doorway to genome editing. In 2013, Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute and George Church at Harvard Medical School led teams that showed it was possible to use the technology to edit the genomes of human and mouse cells. Although genome editing had been tried before, previous techniques tended to be far more painstaking and limited. CRISPR was versatile and simple to use; it allowed for easy and efficient genome editing -- and it worked in all kinds of cells. ""I think genetics is going to be the source of lot of big decisions that are made by stock analysts, politicians, and so forth, and it’s about time we got excited about genetics,"" said Church, who holds CRISPR patents that have not been challenged. ""If there weren’t a race to sequence the human genome, the human genome would have gotten less attention. If CRISPR didn’t have a race for the technology, there would have been less attention."" At the center of the race are superstars of science and a dozen key patents that outline the use of CRISPR to edit DNA in cells. Feng Zhang, a scientist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, was granted those patents in 2014 and 2015. This week, they were found to interfere with a patent application filed by Doudna, a scientist at Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier, who now directs the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. The institutions on both sides of the dispute have made the technology freely available to academic researchers who are using it for basic research, which is precisely what has allowed for a laboratory technique first described in 2012 to become ubiquitous practically overnight. The Broad said it does not plan to change that access to the tool, and Doudna said she did not, either. Companies that plan to commercialize the technology, however, will need to license patents from whichever institution wins the battle. At the end of 2015, three groups of scientists used CRISPR to treat mice with an errant gene that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal disease --- raising hopes for a therapy that could be tested in people one day. Laboratory experiments that were once tedious and time-consuming, such as figuring out which genes are important in disease, or creating animal versions of disease, are suddenly relatively trivial because CRISPR now allows scientists to introduce multiple genetic changes in one step. ""It speeds up the pace of everything we’ve been able to do in the past, to the point where experiments become routine to do that we couldn’t imagine attempting"" before, Doudna said in an interview. As evidence of that promise, a handful of companies set up by different camps in the patent war have already raised hundreds of millions from investors, based on the hope -- likely still years away -- of CRISPR drugs and treatments. Business has been booming for CRISPR companies. Editas Medicine, a Cambridge-based company that previously raised $163 million, announced last week that it planned a $100 million initial public offering and hoped to begin clinical trials in 2017 for a rare genetic disease that causes blindness. CRISPR Therapeutics has raised $89 million and recently announced major partnerships with two drug companies, Bayer and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Another company, Intellia, has raised $85 million and is working with Novartis. Caribou Biosciences has partnered with DuPont and raised $11 million last April. If the patent contest ends with a winner-takes-all sweep, it will mean several things: a significant revenue stream for the victorious institution, and in the interim a bit more uncertainty for the many companies trying to push the technology forward into the clinic. The companies are not directly a party to the current patent dispute, but each has entered into different licensing agreements. Caribou, for example, licenses intellectual property from Berkeley and the University of Vienna; Intellia licenses its technology from Caribou. Editas has licensed the Broad's technology. CRISPR Therapeutics says on its website it has licensed its technology from Charpentier. ""It may chill investment in the competing companies,"" said Jacob Sherkow, a law professor at New York Law School who has been closely following the issue. If ""you don't know what the patent situation is going to be, why plunk down $100 million... [if] you don't know who is going to be the last man standing?"" But people aren't just considering traditional drugs and therapies. Church is spinning a company out of his laboratory called eGenesis that will use CRISPR to make genetic changes that would humanize pig organs and make them safe for transplant -- potentially creating a large supply of organs for transplant. In fact, due to the ease of deploying the technology to alter the human genome, scientists have widely called for restraint, too, before it is used to make genetic tweaks in people that are permanent and can be inherited by the next generation, such as by altering human embryos. While the science rushes forward, the issue of who gets credit continues along its slow, legalistic path. The U.S. has moved to a system in which patents are awarded based on who files the application first. But because Doudna filed her patent before that change, this case is still subject to the older rules -- in which the patent goes to the first inventor. ""I really want to see this move towards clarity in the space,"" Doudna said. ""Even though I don’t see the field held back by this, I think there will be benefits in having clarity in the foundational intellectual property in this field."" Zhang said in an e-mail that he hoped the issue would be resolved quickly, since he worries it will become a distraction from science. In his own laboratory, he said CRISPR is being used to do research on cancer, mental illness, Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, malaria, and rare genetic diseases. ""I would much rather be focusing on science and new research that will benefit human health,"" Zhang said in an email. The Broad Institute released a statement explaining it expected the original patents to be upheld. ""Given that the underlying facts have not changed, we are confident the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will reach the same conclusion it did initially when it awarded the patent and will continue to recognize the Broad and MIT roles in developing this transformative technology,"" Lee McGuire, a Broad spokesman, said in a statement. Bob Sanders, a spokesman for the University of California Berkeley, said that its lawyers declined to comment on the case."	358	"[{""start"": 119, ""end"": 292, ""text"": ""The technology called CRISPR could one day be used to delete the HIV virus from patients' cells, create a limitless supply of organs for transplant and produce better crops."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1339, ""end"": 1829, ""text"": ""This patent, in particular, is ... a significantly huge advance in gene-editing technology, and this type of technology is the core of what has made the biotech revolution.\"" Whether CRISPR will transform health as everyone hopes is currently uncertain, without even a single clinical trial started.

The CRISPR patent fight appears to be over, at least for the moment. A ruling by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board found no “interference” in patents awarded to Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The loser, pending appeals, is the University of California, and the much-heralded biochemist  Jennifer Doudna, who, along with Emmanuelle Charpentier, in 2012 published a groundbreaking paper showing how to exploit a natural bacterial gene-editing system known as CRISPR. The patent office determined that Zhang's later innovations, which used CRISPR to edit mammalian cells, were not simply elaborations of what Doudna and Charpentier had already discovered. In a teleconference with reporters Wednesday, Doudna did not sound deterred by the ruling, saying she will press forward with her own patent application based on the earlier work. “Our patent will likely be issued,” she said. She explained that her patent would cover the use of CRISPR in all cells, while the Zhang patent would more narrowly cover applications of CRISPR in plant and animal (“eukaryotic”) cells. She drew an unusual analogy: “They will have a patent on green tennis balls. We will get a patent on all tennis balls.” Such a situation could potentially make attractive some kind of settlement between the institutions and the inventors to distribute the money from CRISPR licenses. The University of California at Berkeley issued a statement saying that it is considering an appeal: “We continue to maintain that the evidence overwhelmingly supports our position that the Doudna/Charpentier team was the first group to invent this technology for use in all settings and all cell types, and was the first to publish and file patent applications directed toward that invention, and that the Broad Institute’s patents directed toward use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in particular cell types are not patentably distinct from the Doudna/Charpentier invention. For that reason, UC will carefully consider all options for possible next steps in this legal process, including the possibility of an appeal of the PTAB’s decision,” the statement said. The Broad Institute issued a statement saying it agreed with the decision, “which confirms that the patents and applications of Broad Institute and UC Berkeley are about different subjects and do not interfere with each other.” The patent fight has received a great deal of interest because there are potentially enormous sums of money involved, and the dispute pitted major academic institutions against one another. At the same time, CRISPR has unnerved ethicists because it could potentially lead to permanent changes in the human species. A major report from the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine, published Tuesday, said gene editing on the human “germline,” making changes that would persist in sperm or eggs and could be passed along to future generations, could potentially proceed someday but only under very limited circumstances to block devastating congenital diseases. “The Broad appears to be the decisive winner,” said Jacob Sherkow, a professor at New York Law School who has been closely following the case. There is a bit of an academic wrestling match over who should get credit for discovering CRISPR. Doudna and Charpentier were recently awarded one of the biggest prizes in science, and the research is likely to get more awards, potentially a Nobel Prize. Patent ownership won’t by itself settle the question of who gets credit, Sherkow said. “I hope that nobody thinks that this decision from the patent office should detract from Jennifer Doudna and her team’s technical accomplishments in any way,” Sherkow said. “Patent law is strange, unto itself, and it doesn’t necessarily neatly align with scientific advance.” He said that the outcome was not surprising to him, given the tenor of the judges' questions during oral arguments held in December. But he predicted that the University of California, Berkeley, would appeal the decision — a process that could take about a year. What a finding of no interference means, in laymen’s terms, is “that the thing Berkeley invented was different from the thing that the Broad invented,” Sherkow said. Because of that, the patent applications do not interfere with each other — and therefore the Broad’s patents stand. If the patents had been found to interfere, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board would have had to figure out who owned what. CRISPR is the acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, and is a natural system used by bacteria to patrol their genomes for invasive viral genetic material. The system snips away the invasive material and repairs the genome. But then scientists figured out how to exploit the system in the laboratory, targeting genes and potentially very short stretches of a cell's genome. As The Post reported last year: In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier reported that they could reprogram this mechanism; instead of snipping invading viruses, they could use CRISPR to cut DNA very precisely, opening the doorway to genome editing. In 2013, Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute and George Church at Harvard Medical School led teams that showed it was possible to use the technology to edit the genomes of human and mouse cells. Although genome editing had been tried before, previous techniques tended to be far more painstaking and limited. CRISPR was versatile and simple to use; it allowed for easy and efficient genome editing — and it worked in all kinds of cells. Zhang was granted CRISPR patents in 2014 and 2015; Doudna and Charpentier challenged that, saying they came up with the gene editing technique first. The patent office essentially said Zhang's work is sufficiently distinct that it deserved its own set of patents. In the Berkeley statement, the university said it will continue to apply for patents based on the earlier discoveries. Doudna also issued a statement through the university: “As a proud member of UC Berkeley’s faculty, I am engaged in bringing the power of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to benefit humanity and develop new industries in biomedicine, agriculture, public health, and environmental technologies,” she said.  “I am pleased that research using CRISPR-Cas9 continues to drive exciting advances in many areas of biology.” This story has been updated.  	357	"[{""start"": 372, ""end"": 492, ""text"": ""in 2012 published a groundbreaking paper showing how to exploit a natural bacterial gene-editing system known as CRISPR."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2680, ""end"": 3049, ""text"": ""A major report from the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine, published Tuesday, said gene editing on the human “germline,” making changes that would persist in sperm or eggs and could be passed along to future generations, could potentially proceed someday but only under very limited circumstances to block devastating congenital diseases"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4480, ""end"": 4884, ""text"": ""CRISPR is the acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, and is a natural system used by bacteria to patrol their genomes for invasive viral genetic material.

"Earlier this year, Chinese scientists caused an international furor when they reported that they had taken 86 human embryos and attempted to modify the gene that causes β-thalassaemia, a blood disorder that is potentially fatal. It was the first time edits had been confirmed to have been done on reproductive cells and the news caused deep divisions within the scientific community. Some expressed optimism and hope that such research could eventually lead to the eradication of genetic diseases from the face of the Earth. Others were horrified — warning that genetically modifying humans is unsafe and could have devastating consequences on future generations of our race that no one can foresee. [The rumors were true: Scientists edited the genomes of human embryos for the first time] Now another group of scientists — this time from Britain — is seeking permission to conduct similar experiments, raising the stakes for the technology. Kathy Niakan, a stem-cell researcher at the Francis Crick Institute in London, has told the country's regulators that her work will focus on trying to understand what genes are at play during the first few days after fertilization, according to a report in the Guardian. She would switch genes off and on to study how the modifications impacted the development of the cells that form the placenta. “The knowledge we acquire will be very important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops, and this will inform our understanding of the causes of miscarriage,"" Niakan explained. The embryos would come from donations from couples who had undergone IVF treatment and would only be used for basic research. It would be illegal for them to be implanted in a woman and allowed to grow more than two weeks. Several other British scientists spoke out in support of the research. Peter Braude, emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynecology at King's College London, said in a statement that the research ""is about better understanding nature, not changing embryos for implantation.” Sarah Chan, a fellow at the Usher Institute for Population Health Sciences and Informatics at the University of Edinburgh said that the news should be ""cause of confidence, not concern."" ""Genome-editing research undeniably has tremendous scientific potential, and U.K. scientists are poised to make a world-leading contribution to this exciting field. At the same time, we should be reassured to know that this work is being carried out under a robust regulatory scheme that ensures high scientific and ethical standards,"" Chan said. [FDA debates 'three-parent' embryos] The reaction from others in the scientific community, however, was one of alarm. ""This proposal is a troubling and provocative move,"" said Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society. ""Modifying the genes of human embryos is deeply controversial because it can be used for worthwhile research on the one hand, or to produce genetically modified human beings on the other. A global public conversation about preventing such misuses is just getting underway, and this proposal could short-circuit those deliberations."" Likewise, Georgetown University Medical Center associate professor Kevin T. FitzGerald said he hopes British authorities ""will delay processing this request by the Francis Crick Institute until the broad, public engagement that is needed to help guide the use of this powerful research tool can be accomplished.” Debate about so-called germline editing of eggs, sperm and embryos has been going on for decades, but it has come to a head in recent years with the development of a powerful new gene-editing technology called Crispr-Cas9 that can make extremely precise edits to DNA and which was used by the Chinese team and would be used by the British team. Michael Werner, executive director of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, a D.C.-based group that has been leading calls for a moratorium on the technology, called the research ""highly premature."" ""We believe that this type of multi-stakeholder discussion is necessary before proceeding, given the significant issues and concerns related to human germline genome editing,"" he said. A discussion is scheduled for  Dec. 1-3 during the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine international summit here Washington, D.C.

Genome sequencing is supposed to be the future of medicine — a revolution that will bring about a new age of tailored treatments and unprecedented insight into people's individual biology. But perhaps nowhere are the “what if?” questions raised by genome sequencing more complex and ethically treacherous than at birth: Should we sequence the DNA of healthy newborn babies? On one hand, the technology could reveal powerful information about babies' disease risk that could prevent illness or manage it. But those insights could also be muddled, complicated and unnecessarily worrisome due to the evolving and incomplete scientific understanding of what it means to carry any particular version of a gene — called a variant. Parents may not be prepared for what the technology might reveal — not only about their baby, but about themselves. An ongoing clinical trial at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital, called BabySeq, is trying to untangle some basic questions about the benefits and harms of gene sequencing. Does it improve health? Does it lead to lots of excessive medical testing? Does it cause harm? On Wednesday, medical geneticist Robert C. Green will present a peek at early results at a meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. So far the BabySeq researchers have recruited more than 150 families, who have been randomly assigned to receive sequencing or standard care. They've reported sequencing results back to 51 of them. The researchers' results so far provide a glimpse of what this new genomic age is going to look like — and the bottom line may be that newborn testing so far looks less desirable and less conclusive than was expected. The first surprise is that it's just a much harder road than anyone expected to get families to sign up. Before they began BabySeq, Green and colleagues approached hundreds of parents of newborns within two days of birth to gauge their hypothetical interest in genome sequencing. That study, published in Genetics in Medicine, led them to believe that parents were very interested in the information: More than three-quarters of parents said they were somewhat, very or extremely interested in testing. But when the choice was no longer hypothetical, Green and colleagues found parents were more hesitant. The researchers have approached more than 2,000 families of healthy newborns and nearly 350 families with babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, and in both groups only about 7 percent enrolled in the study. Many declined to participate due to the logistical requirements of the study, but it was far from the only reason. “There are a surprising number of families who are deeply concerned about privacy and confidentiality, who are deeply concerned about the possibility to receive uncertain or unfavorable results and the possibility of insurance discrimination,” Green said. A federal law prohibits employers or health insurers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information, but it doesn't apply to life insurance. The second insight has to do with the information itself. Genetic test results seem like they should be reassuringly binary: You have a gene mutation or not. But the truth is that what we know about our genes is in flux and that even a gene that has been linked convincingly to a disease won't always cause the disease in every person. And even if the link between the gene and the disease is well-established, what to do with the information may not be clear. Green and colleagues carefully curated the genes that they included in their report to parents, looking for well-established genes linked to diseases of early childhood. They reported gene variants when there was good scientific evidence that they were pathogenic, or likely to cause disease. Of the 51 infants who had their genes sequenced, three carried gene variants that were classified either as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for heart disease if a person carries just one copy. (People have two copies of each gene.) Neither the babies nor the parents had any signs of illness. Those families have generally gone for further testing or cardiac evaluation, Green said, but it's uncertain at this point what value this genetic information will have in improving their health — they could develop a condition later in life, but they also might not. “It reinforces the notion that you can carry these pathogenic variants, but simply not ever develop the disease,” Green said. Another baby carried two variants that cause a metabolic disorder, an enzyme deficiency. The condition was not picked up on routine newborn screening, Green said. The baby is developing normally and will probably get dietary supplements as a precaution. In a last case, a baby carried a copy of the BRCA2 gene, associated with a high risk of breast cancer in adulthood. This led the team to one of the key moral conundrums that has come up with genetic testing, since the prevailing approach in children has been not to return information on adult conditions. Disclosing the gene variant could disturb the ethical principle of maintaining an “open future” for a child, until they can decide for themselves if they want to know their own genetic information. Not disclosing it could withhold valuable health information from the parents. The team got permission from two ethical review boards to ask the parents of that baby if they wanted to know health information that could be pertinent to their health. They eventually disclosed the mutation, which was carried by the mother, who can now seek further preventive care. “People hear that you’re doing a project with sequencing of babies, and all these questions leap to mind,” Green said. “And it’s not that we’re solving them, but my hope is that through even the early part of the project, we’re bringing them from the hypothetical realm to the realm of actual experimental trials.” Read More: Gene therapies offer dramatic promise but shocking costs Control of CRISPR, biotech’s most promising breakthrough, is in dispute A government panel said drinking coffee is harmless.

Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we’re talking about human genetic engineering. For a half-century, the ethics of human genetic engineering have been discussed in the abstract. Because the tools to edit DNA didn’t exist, the question was more a thought experiment than a real concern. Today, though, the conversation has completely changed. There has been a frenzy of excitement around the possibilities of CRISPR-Cas9. The technology, which allows scientists to design proteins that unzip and replace chunks of DNA as they please, makes it possible to edit genes quickly and cheaply. Investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the innovation, which seems to have endless possibilities: making crops more resilient to diseases, designing mosquitoes so they can’t carry malaria — maybe even eliminating diseases among humans by altering the genes we pass on. [What’s scarier? Tinkering with mosquito DNA, or malaria?] Scientists are confident that the technology could one day eliminate genetic disorders in humans. However, the research is still very young, and there are major ethical questions attached to editing human DNA that the emergence of CRISPR makes even more pressing: Wouldn’t editing out inheritable traits from the human population simply amount to eugenics? Could there be unanticipated negative consequences for future generations? How do you distinguish between negative “disorders” and valuable diversity? The field of genetics has always had an uncomfortable link to eugenics: the science of improving people through controlled breeding. Centuries ago, people realized that desirable traits in farm animals could be passed down to their offspring. In the late 19th century, “social Darwinists” began to advocate for artificial selection among humans as well, often along racial terms. Such policies were enacted under fascist regimes during World War II, with the expressed goal of eliminating what were seen as negative traits from the human gene pool through genocide or sexual sterilization. The United States even had versions of these involuntary sterilization policies, implemented to protect the country’s “racial hygiene.” Today, the scientific community soundly condemns such atrocities, yet prominent biologists have long advocated for genetic engineering as a means of perfecting the human species. During the 1950s and ’60s, as postwar thinkers began uncoiling the mysteries of DNA, scientists began to suggest that people may one day be able to guide human evolution by altering the microscopic blueprints government laid out in our cells. Nobel Prize-winning biologist Joshua Lederberg conceded that altering human DNA could possibly lead to eugenics of a sort, but he argued that it was substantially different from the genocidal eugenics committed by the Nazis. No living person would be eliminated from the gene pool — as eugenics often implies. Instead, society could guide human development by eliminating negative traits and encouraging desirable ones through genetic engineering. Evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane called this “positive eugenics.” At the time, though, there was no technology available to edit human DNA, so Lederberg viewed talking about guiding human evolution as “diversionary” to the true potential of genetics: research that could lead to medical gains. The question of eugenics remained largely marginal. Over the next few decades, genetic research would, in fact, produce milestone advancements in the medical field. DNA research has produced treatments for diabetes and potentially for Parkinson’s disease. CRISPR was, in fact, discovered not by scientists who wanted to edit the genome but by researchers studying genetic immunity among bacteria. Unexpectedly, CRISPR technology has led to a vast range of medical possibilities, from “three parent” children to the prevention of mitochondrial diseases. Today, CRISPR has captured the fantasies of those who emphasize the high-flying possibilities of human-led evolution. Some look forward to “designer babies,” suggesting that altering children to have higher intelligence is inevitable for human progress. Others argue that we should engineer humans so they have a reduced impact on the environment. [Are scientists blocking their own progress?] Of course, these proposals are still wildly unrealistic. But we’re no longer in an era where scientists can shrug off eugenicist rhetoric as too distant to worry about. This month, Britain became the first country to approve public funding for projects that edit the human genome. At the pace that CRISPR technology is advancing, it’s likely that the United States and other governments will want to follow suit. While 83 percent of the American public is solidly against editing genes for frivolous purposes such as increasing intelligence, about half of those asked were fine with the idea of doing so to treat diseases. The time to distinguish between negative eugenics and positive genetic intervention is now. But how far are we willing to go? Ending truly debilitating diseases may be one thing, but what about conditions such as dwarfism? Current CRISPR research might lead to genetic treatments for autism. Given that the possibilities truly are endless, should we edit out traits that many people have come to accept and celebrate? Isn’t there a moral, social and physical advantage in allowing diversity to flourish within the human gene pool? In the end, where we draw the line will be a political question. The scientific community has already begun this discussion, but it’s not unreasonable to expect a more involved debate in the near future — one in which the general public will have a greater say in how science will proceed.

"You probably wouldn't be surprised if a scientist told you that your genes influence when you hit puberty, how tall you are, what your BMI will be and whether you're likely to develop male pattern baldness. But what if he said that the same gene could hold sway over all four things? That finding comes from a study published Monday in the journal Nature Genetics. Using data from dozens of genome-wide association studies (big scans of complete sets of DNA from many thousands of people), researchers at the New York Genome Center and the genetic analysis company 23andMe found examples of single ""multitasking"" genes that influence diverse and sometimes seemingly disparate traits. The scientists say that the links they uncovered could help researchers understand how certain genes work, and figure out better ways of treating some of the health problems they might control. ""Most studies tend to go one disease at a time,"" said Joseph Pickrell, a professor at Columbia University and the New York Genome Center's lead investigator on the project. ""But if we can try to make these sorts of connections between what you might think of as unrelated traits ... that gives us another angle of attack to understand the connections between these different diseases."" To start, Pickrell and his team sought out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identifying particular genetic variants associated with 42 different traits. Many had to do with diseases (for example, studies that linked certain genes to the risk of developing Alzheimer's or type 2 diabetes) and other personal health traits (body mass index, blood type, cholesterol levels). But the researchers also looked at traits that don't often get studied, like chin dimples and the tendency to sneeze when you see the sun (yes, the ""photic sneeze reflex"" is an actual genetic condition, and Rachel totally has it). Data from 23andMe was useful for studying those kinds of traits, Pickrell said: a scientist can't exactly go to the NIH and ask for funding to find the gene for sneezing in sunlight. (Well, maybe he could ask. But he probably wouldn't get any.) But the biotech company collects that kind of information anyway for its personal genome tests. Seventeen of the studies surveyed for the paper were conducted by 23andMe researchers using the company's database of more than 1 million users. The biotech company has come under scrutiny in recent years. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration warned the company to stop giving customers health-related results out of concern that the tests might be inaccurate or misleading in influencing medical decisions. The company has since revamped its test, with input from regulators, to offer what it says are more scientifically sound results on a smaller group of diseases. Pickrell said he's confident in the 23andMe studies, adding that an outside GWAS about the onset of menarche (the fancy term for periods) in girls gave very similar results to the one done by the biotech company's researchers. Armed with all these studies, Pickrell and his team then cross-referenced them to identify more than 300 spots on the genome that were associated with more than one trait. In some cases, predisposition to two different diseases could be definitively linked to a particular genetic variation — for example, a variant that controls the transportation of metals around cells was associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and decreased risk for Parkinson's disease. ""That tells us that heavy metal transport is important for all those diseases in different ways,"" Pickrell said. It should also inform researchers trying to develop treatments for patients with either disease, he added: ""If you can understand why [they are linked] in principle, you could start to think about ... if I’m developing a drug for schizophrenia will it have an adverse effect on a person with Parkinson's?"" In other cases, researchers weren't able to nail down the particular genetic variant that linked traits. But usually it made sense that the traits would be associated with one another. For example, height, age of puberty, BMI and baldness — all associated with the same spot on the genome — are influenced by hormones. It seems likely that there's a gene somewhere controlling the release of hormones that affect all these other things. Likewise, many immune system-related problems, including asthma, allergies and susceptibility to childhood ear infections, were clustered around a particular spot on the genome. Of course, the links between genes and diseases aren't one to one. Having a particular variant may predispose you to allergies, or Parkinson's, or sneezing when the sun comes out, or even some combination of the three, but it doesn't determine your destiny. Genes are complicated. But the study could help disentangle some of that complexity. ""It’s a smart use of available data,” Matthew Rockman, a biologist at New York University who was not involved in the study, told the magazine the Scientist about Pickrell's work. ""Revealing commonalities among different kinds of diseases could point towards unexpected avenues of therapy, [even if that] is still very distant,"" Rockman said.

In just the past nine months, venture capitalists have plunked down more than $200 million in start-up companies developing an innovative gene-editing technology known as CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats). In 2014, MIT Technology Review touted this gene-editing technology as “the biggest biotech discovery of the century.” At the very least, CRISPR (more formally known as CRISP-Cas9) is the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years. Measured against any benchmark — such as the number of patents and scientific publications or the amount of government funding and private sector funding – interest in CRISPR has skyrocketed since 2013. What CRISPR enables, say its proponents, is a quick, easy and effective way to edit the genes of any species – including humans. Other methods take months or years, while CRISPR speeds that time up to mere weeks. The ability to cut and splice genes so quickly and so precisely has potential applications for the ability to create new biofuels, materials, drugs and foods within much shorter time frames at a relatively low cost. In a nutshell, CRISPR is a synthetic biology technique that takes advantage of the sophisticated immune systems of bacteria. Researchers essentially trick bacteria into cutting strands of DNA at a precise spot, where they can then replace, change or disable a gene. While scientific research into the CRISPR microbial defense mechanism dates back to the late 1980s, it was not until 2012 that the immense genetic implications became clear. CRISPR essentially enables researchers to edit the DNA of any species at a precise location. Once you can locate the “interspacers” (the I in CRISPR) separating the “palindromic repeats” (the P and R in CRISPR), you can cut and change genes nearly anywhere in the genome. In the most exciting scenario, CRISPR would make it possible to treat genetic diseases such as sickle-cell anemia and muscular dystrophy. Despite its rather innocuous-sounding name (pronounced “crisper”) and its potential life-changing medical applications, CRISPR has become the center of an intense debate about the future of synthetic biology. Some, such as my colleague Vivek Wadhwa, have called for a global moratorium on the gene-editing technology, due to ethical and safety concerns. From editing microbial DNA in lab test tubes, it’s a slippery slope to editing human DNA in living cells. “No one is prepared for an era when editing DNA is as easy as editing a Microsoft Word document,” says Wadhwa. In one controversial scenario, it might be theoretically possible to alter the genetic material that controls hereditary characteristics, not just the genetic material of somatic cells. At some point, fear researchers, it might be possible to control the specific traits that we pass on to our offspring by tinkering with the genes in a human embryo. That’s the classic “Frankenbabies” scenario, in which tinkering with a few genes to create a “designer baby” leads to a whole host of irreversible genetic consequences. That’s not just science fiction. Earlier this year, Chinese researchers showed how CRISPR techniques might be theoretically possible to utilize on a non-viable human embryo – and set off a firestorm of debate about the ethics involved. Mainstream scientific publications refused to publish the results, citing ethical and safety concerns about creating genetically modified humans. The Center for Genetics and Society has even put together a briefing of seven key reasons why genetically modified humans could be so dangerous. Point No. 1? “Profound health risks to future children.” Messing around with the genetics of an unborn child is serious business. Even tinkering with a single gene (e.g. “eye color”) could have unforeseen implications: “Altering the genomes of our offspring — not just the first generation but all later ones as well — means irreversibly changing every cell in their bodies, forever.” That’s why venture capitalists have focused on companies within the much safer area of genomic medicine, where CRISPR can address genetically driven diseases without the risk of tinkering with hereditary characteristics. The big deal that pushed CRISPR into the mainstream was the blockbuster $120 million Series B round this summer for Editas Medicine, which is led by some of the biggest names in the CRISPR world: Feng Zhang, a researcher at the Broad Institute, Jennifer Doudna and David Liu from Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and George Church and J. Keith Joung from Harvard Medical School. Of course, it could be the case that CRISPR is getting overhyped. After all, it’s not so much a product or service as it is a tool or technique. That means that competitors could one day come up with another tool or technique that’s cheaper, better or faster than CRISPR in the same way that CRISPR has rapidly eclipsed other gene-editing techniques, such as TALENs and zinc fingers. Keep your eye on this space. Big international proceedings are set to take place later this year to discuss gene-editing, and there’s sure to be greater guidance and debate as to what’s possible and what next steps should be when it comes to editing genes. However, despite the justified concerns about the potential applications of gene-editing technologies, it’s hard not to acknowledge that the gene is already out of the bottle when it comes to CRISPR.	353	"[{""start"": 8, ""end"": 232, ""text"": ""the past nine months, venture capitalists have plunked down more than $200 million in start-up companies developing an innovative gene-editing technology known as CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats)"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 351, ""end"": 698, ""text"": ""At the very least, CRISPR (more formally known as CRISP-Cas9) is the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years.

The National Institutes of Health is undertaking an ambitious collaboration with private industry in an attempt to speed up the search for treatments for some of the world’s most devastating diseases — Alzheimer’s, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The pilot projects announced Tuesday will involve the sharing of not only scientists but also of data, blood samples and tissue specimens among 10 rival companies, the federal government and several nonprofit groups and research foundations. The companies that have signed up to participate include most of the large drug makers, which in the past had resisted calls to share detailed data and samples from experiments, preferring to instead use the information to gain lucrative patents. The agreement with NIH represents a major break from how they used to do business. The competing pharmaceutical companies have said they will hold off launching commercial ventures based on discoveries from the partnership until after the data has been made publicly available. The idea behind the collaboration is similar to that of the “open source” movement among some computer scientists who believe that sharing their code with anyone who wants it is the best way to innovate. The first group of projects, which will last three to five years, will involve an investment of more than $230 million from industry participants including Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi and Takeda, as well as a few smaller biotech companies. At its core, the collaboration aims to change the way biomedical research has been conducted at a fundamental level. For the most part, scientists working on new drugs still depend on trial and error, making guesses about what could work as a treatment and then testing their hypotheses. The initiative — called the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, or AMP — takes a more comprehensive approach, bringing scientists from industry and government together to look at the universe of possibilities and prioritize the most promising targets for treatments. NIH Director Francis S. Collins said Tuesday that researchers are investing a great deal of money and time in areas of research that have high rates of failure. “We are going to try to increase the odds of picking the right targets to go after for the next generation of drug development,” he said. In other words, Collins said, the partnership aims to “avoid wasting precious time and money chasing duds.” In many ways, the project builds on the foundation of data analysis and sharing that was laid by the sequencing of the human genome in 2001. Since then, there has been an explosion of big data in three major areas of scientific research: genomics, with the cost and time to sequence DNA plummeting; proteomics, with breakthroughs in the understanding of the involvement of proteins in disease; and in the ability to process, store and analyze high-resolution images. Despite this immense progress in basic research, there have been few breakthrough treatments for patients suffering from disease. And each year, researchers end up abandoning 90 to 99 percent of drugs that seemed promising in the early stages of research. The most painful failures happen when drugs reach “phase 2” and “phase 3” clinical trials with patients. By that time, researchers have usually spent years and hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars. Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and development at Pfizer, called the current approach “fragmented” and said what the group is trying to develop is a “precise navigation system, a GPS for human disease.” The partnership, the product of two years of negotiations between officials at NIH and the drug companies, aims to streamline the process of drug development at its initial stage by bringing researchers together to sift through the very large data set of opportunities in an effort to find and test new “biomarkers” for disease. Collins said such mind-sharing and data-sharing will compress the timeline for developing new drugs and reduce costs at the same time. While the first phase of the project will be focused mostly on collaborations between the industry and NIH, Robert Clarke, dean of research at Georgetown University Medical Center, said he hopes the partnership will grow to include academia. He said he believes the projects could eventually lead to a sea change in the scientific community’s attitudes toward sharing the details of research and that he imagines a day when there will be new models for those types of collaborations and new channels for funding researchers who want to build on publicly shared data. “We have been using our limited resources to reinvent the wheel for too long,” he said. D. Lansing Taylor, director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Drug Discovery Institute, said the announcement comes at a time of increasing pressure on pharmaceutical companies’ finances. With the patents for many of the industry’s blockbuster drugs expired or expiring and a controversy simmering over toxicity issues related to some new therapies, drug makers are seeking new ways of doing business. “Collaboration is a necessity. It’s not an option anymore,” Taylor said. “It’s too expensive to develop and utilize the new technologies on your own.”	351	"[{""start"": 264, ""end"": 504, ""text"": ""The pilot projects announced Tuesday will involve the sharing of not only scientists but also of data, blood samples and tissue specimens among 10 rival companies, the federal government and several nonprofit groups and research foundations"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2500, ""end"": 2640, ""text"": ""In many ways, the project builds on the foundation of data analysis and sharing that was laid by the sequencing of the human genome in 2001."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2641, ""end"": 2965, ""text"": ""Since then, there has been an explosion of big data in three major areas of scientific research: genomics, with the cost and time to sequence DNA plummeting; proteomics, with breakthroughs in the understanding of the involvement of proteins in disease; and in the ability to process, store and analyze high-resolution images"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3431, ""end"": 3650, ""text"": ""Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and development at Pfizer, called the current approach “fragmented” and said what the group is trying to develop is a “precise navigation system, a GPS for human disease.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 264, ""end"": 504, ""text"": ""The pilot projects announced Tuesday will involve the sharing of not only scientists but also of data, blood samples and tissue specimens among 10 rival companies, the federal government and several nonprofit groups and research foundations"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	359	2023-03-30T11:05:45.127532Z	2023-03-30T11:05:45.127601Z	754.82
Who said scientists can’t be world-famous celebrities? On Sunday, nearly $22 million in Breakthrough Prizes were handed out to the world’s top researchers in physics, the life sciences, and mathematics. The $3 million Breakthrough Prizes, at twice the dollar amount of the Nobel Prize, are the highest dollar prizes awarded to scientists in the world. The goal of the Breakthrough Prize awards, founded by luminaries within the tech world (including Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma and Sergey Brin) three years ago, is to draw more attention to important work being done in the basic sciences. Judging by the celebrities who showed up for the star-studded ceremony at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley — Seth MacFarlane, Russell Crowe, Pharrell Williams and Hilary Swank – scientists doing pioneering research are starting to attract additional high-profile attention. These are three of the breakthrough ideas that we’ll be hearing more about in 2016: 1. Neutrinos are the key to understanding the known universe The 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics went to a core group of seven research leaders and 1,370 other researchers studying neutrino oscillations at five different laboratories around the world. Two of these researchers – Arthur B. McDonald of Queen’s University in Canada and Takaaki Kajita of the University of Tokyo in Japan — already won the Nobel Prize in Physics in October of this year for their discovery that neutrinos can oscillate between three different “flavors.” Given the ability of neutrinos to oscillate, the researchers conjecture that they must have a very tiny mass, tens of millions of times smaller than that of protons. That’s actually a big deal, since it contradicts the Standard Model of particle physics, which suggests that neutrinos have zero mass. While neutrinos are some of the most abundant particles in the universe, they are also among the most mysterious. They travel at nearly the speed of light, yet don’t interact with other matter in observable ways. Researchers can only study them by trapping them in underground caves in huge vats of water. Yet scientists now believe that these shape-shifting neutrinos are the key to understanding the known universe — everything from dark matter to supernovas. 2. Understanding the human genome can lead to new treatments for diseases The Breakthrough Prizes in Life Sciences went to researchers who are tracking down the way that specific genes lead to diseases. John Hardy, of the University College London, won for discovering mutations in the Amyloid Precursor Protein gene (APP) that causes early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Helen Hobbs, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, won for the discovery of human genetic variants that alter the levels and distribution of cholesterol and other lipids, inspiring new approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular and liver disease. Being able to track down the genetic basis for diseases is now one of the hottest ideas in medicine. Thanks to new gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR, advanced knowledge of how specific genes work, and a broader knowledge of the human genome, it’s possible to imagine a future in which certain genes can be edited to prevent future disease. If a certain gene is responsible for the human body creating too much cholesterol, for example, it might be possible to edit it, so as to prevent the onset of specific diseases. 3. Exploring ancient DNA can help to explain the origins of humans The traditional way to learn about extinct species is by digging up old bones or, in the case of early humans, examining stone tools they might have left behind. But what if you could learn about them by studying their DNA? Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology won a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for pioneering the sequencing of ancient DNA and ancient genomes, with a focus on understanding the origins of modern humans, their relationships to extinct relatives such as Neanderthals, and the evolution of human populations and traits. Pääbo has been studying the DNA of ancient Neanderthals from 40,000 years ago and is working on mapping the entire Neanderthal genome. Once you compare the ancient Neanderthal genome with the modern human genome, it may be possible to detect the specific genetic changes that resulted in the first modern humans. There are other scenarios whereby techniques used to study ancient DNA might have interesting implications. What if, for example, researchers start exploring the ancient DNA of the wooly mammoth or some other extinct species? It might be possible to bring an extinct species back to life once you are able to map its entire genome. *** It’s clear that technology is changing our view of the world both at a very grand scale – the size of the universe – and at an infinitesimally small scale – the size of genes and neutrinos. The more we seem to know, though, the more mysterious life – and our place in the universe — appears to be. And that’s why these Breakthrough Prizes are so important. “Breakthrough Prize laureates are making fundamental discoveries about the universe, life and the mind,” Breakthrough Prize co-founder Yuri Milner said. “These fields of investigation are advancing at an exponential pace, yet the biggest questions remain to be answered.”	350	"[{""start"": 2275, ""end"": 2474, ""text"": ""Understanding the human genome can lead to new treatments for diseases The Breakthrough Prizes in Life Sciences went to researchers who are tracking down the way that specific genes lead to diseases."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2475, ""end"": 2638, ""text"": ""John Hardy, of the University College London, won for discovering mutations in the Amyloid Precursor Protein gene (APP) that causes early onset Alzheimer’s diseas"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2640, ""end"": 3461, ""text"": ""Helen Hobbs, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, won for the discovery of human genetic variants that alter the levels and distribution of cholesterol and other lipids, inspiring new approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular and liver disease.

Every human genome contains the blueprints for building a person, a library of roughly 20,000 genes that encode everything from eye color to cancer risk. Imagine if those genetic instructions could be tweaked at will — with a snip here and a cut there, a gene might be deleted, inserted or replaced by a different piece of DNA. Tools that can do this already exist, but one in particular, called CRISPR/Cas 9, has leapt ahead of other genome-editing tools because it’s cost-effective and simple. Researchers say that human clinical trials to fix genetic diseases — for example, sickle cell anemia — are only a few years away. Last month, a team of Chinese researchers reported that, in a first-of-its-kind event, they had edited the genomes of human embryos. (The embryos, obtained from local fertility clinics, would not have resulted in live births because they contained an extra set of chromosomes.) The scientists’ aim was to modify the gene responsible for a common blood disorder using CRISPR. The majority of embryos developed unintended mutations, and only a small fraction of them had the blood-disorder gene correctly modified — not what you’d call a success. Many experts believe it was too soon for such work to be carried out — both because the technology is not yet perfected and because the ethical, medical and legal implications of the research have not been hashed out. Soon after the results were published — by the open-access journal Protein & Cell — the National Institutes of Health reaffirmed its ban on gene editing of human embryos. In a statement released April 29, NIH Director Francis S. Collins said that genome editing in human embryos is “a line that should not be crossed” due to safety and ethical issues “presented by altering the germline in a way that affects the next generation without their consent, and a current lack of compelling medical applications justifying the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in embryos.” Genome editing of a human embryo would affect every cell in the embryo’s resulting fetus, as opposed to altering the DNA of a select type of cells — such as the stem cells that produce blood cells. ‘A molecular scalpel’ “You can think about it as a molecular scalpel,” said biochemist Jennifer Doudna of the University of California at Berkeley. “It’s a way for making a really precise change in an organism, such as changing a disease-causing mutation into one that is harmless.” The CRISPR system is a collection of molecules that work together to edit an organism’s DNA. These molecules can be packed into an empty virus and then injected along with a molecule to jump-start the process once the virus encounters a cell. Another approach is to remove cells with undesirable mutations from the body, edit them in a petri dish and insert them back into the body. Such an easy method of genome manipulation has prompted tremendous excitement in the biological sciences community, as a flood of academic labs and start-up companies scramble to take advantage of CRISPR’s capabilities. But with that buzz have come big ethical questions. “No one should be doing anything right now until we figure out what the hell is going on with this technique in animals,” said bioethicist Arthur Caplan of New York University. “That’s how we perfected in vitro fertilization, and that’s how you establish safety — you do it in animals first.” But amid the fears of mad scientists creating designer babies and real-life Jurassic Parks, experts agree on one thing: It is no longer a matter of if but rather of when CRISPR-based genomic surgery will come to a hospital near you. Genomic sequencing is readily and cheaply available, and genetic testing and disease screening have long been underway in clinics across the country. “As much as we worry about premature or ethical use, using these technologies to get rid of genetic disease would be amazing: Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, hemophilia,” Caplan said. “We’ve never really wiped out a disease except for smallpox, and these technologies might actually add to the list.” Rumors of the experiment by scientists based at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong spurred others, including Doudna, to meet in January to discuss the future of the technology and its responsible use in humans. A particular focus was germline editing, which refers to changing the DNA of fertilized eggs or embryos. Such editing affects all cells in the developing organism and passes those changes down to future generations. The scientists, in a summary of their meeting published by the journal Science in April, strongly discourage their colleagues from attempting any germline editing in humans. However, they remain supportive of basic CRISPR research on animals and non-embryonic human cells to see if human germline gene therapy might be helpful in the future to fix genetic mutations. Doudna is planning to convene a larger, international meeting later this year. “We really need to be getting in front of this conversation,” she said. “The field has just taken off in an unbelievable way, with many hundreds of papers being published in the scientific literature now, not just in human health but other areas as well.” While Doudna and French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier are commonly cited as the inventors of CRISPR/Cas9, we can actually thank modest, single-celled bacteria for this revolutionary genome editing system. “CRISPR” stands for “clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats,” first described in 1987 by Japanese researchers who found chunks of oddly repeating DNA sequences in the genome of E. coli. It wasn’t until about 15 years later that scientists realized the purpose of CRISPRs: They are a key part of the bacterium’s immune system. Each CRISPR is followed by unique DNA segments of viruses that the bacterium previously encountered: If that type of virus tries to attack the cell again, a CRISPR can recognize and defend against it. CRISPRs have been found in 45 percent of sequenced bacteria genomes and in 84 percent of archaea, a type of single-cell microorganism. Cas9, a scissors-like enzyme, uses the viral DNA segments as an identification system to check for foreign invaders. If the DNA of an incoming suspicious entity is a match, Cas9 proceeds to chop up the intruder’s genetic material by severing both strands of the double helix molecule. In 2012, Doudna and Charpentier published a study in which they adapted parts of the bacterium’s immune system to create a simple two-part genome editing tool: The Cas9 enzyme and the guide sequence — a small piece of single-stranded RNA 20 nucleotides, or “letters,” long — could be used to target any spot in the genome for cutting. From that point on, CRISPR/Cas9 technology exploded. The next year, it was used to edit the genomes of human and mouse cells, followed by frogs, monkeys and such crop plants as rice and wheat. “The range of possible applications is really quite broad, but translating from this very experimental science into real therapeutics — there is a lot of work to be done,” said Katrine Bosley, chief executive of Editas Medicine, a start-up in Cambridge, Mass., that is trying to develop CRISPR/Cas9-based drugs to treat genetic mutations. Perhaps the biggest issue left to solve involves off-target cuts, which occur when Cas9 gets a bit snip-happy and chops the genome in unintended places. These mistakes can cause big problems, including cell toxicity and cancer. “Sometimes Cas9 can recognize sequences that are very similar but not identical to the target sequence,” said biological engineer Feng Zhang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-founder of Editas and head of a lab at the Broad Institute, a Harvard-MIT biomedical research collaborative. “Depending on the specific sequence, the off-target effect may be more severe or less of a problem.” Biomedical engineer Gang Bao of Rice University said that scientists cannot answer yet whether, even with some off-target effects, it can be used for humans. In his lab, Bao is analyzing off-target effects for his treatment of the genetic mutation that causes sickle cell disease. The idea is to take blood-cell-producing stem cells from a patient, use CRISPR to correct the mutation and then reinsert the stem cells back into the bone marrow. Every step of the process requires precision, from minimizing off-target cuts to getting the modified stem cells to survive and transform into blood cells. Stem cell trials After having initial success using CRISPR therapy with mice, he has moved on to inserting human stem cells into monkeys for his experiments. He hopes to initiate the first human clinical trials in 2018. Editas is taking a different approach, working to neatly package CRISPR/Cas9 into a virus for direct delivery into the patient’s body and letting the genome editing happen there. For certain diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, which affects the lungs and other organs, Editas researchers must figure out how to get the viruses into the right cells while avoiding others. “From the patient’s perspective, [the therapeutic] would be an injection of some sort — maybe an IV, maybe a local injection,” Bosley said. “If you’re working on a genetic disease of the eye, you might do a direct injection into the eye.” Bao and Bosley say they aren’t interested in germline editing and don’t believe that it is necessary for the medical applications they are working on. Their work, which involves modifying somatic, or non-germline, cells, might have unexpected consequences down the line as well. The technology is so new that no one really knows.
