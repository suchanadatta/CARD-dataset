“In the 40, 50 years of the Endangered Species Act, we’ve recovered very few species. … The act itself hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species.” — EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, in an interview on Fox Business Network, Aug. 14 The Trump administration has finalized new rules to weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, a bedrock wildlife conservation law that bars the development of lands where at-risk species live. In a Fox Business interview, Wheeler defended the regulatory changes, stating that the ESA has “recovered very few species.” Government statistics show that 47 species of plants and animals deemed at risk under the ESA have been “recovered,” out of nearly 2,000 that have appeared on the list. But Wheeler is using a very strict definition of what it means to save a species from extinction. These conservation efforts work over many years, and not all species joined the list in 1973. The ESA could be helping a “threatened” or “endangered” species regrow its population significantly before U.S. officials classify it as “recovered” and take it off the list. President Richard M. Nixon signed the bipartisan Endangered Species Act following simpler conservation statutes passed in 1966 and 1969. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) administers the parts of the law that pertain to land and freshwater wildlife, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for most marine and anadromous wildlife. A plant or animal breed can be listed as either “endangered” or “threatened” under the ESA after an assessment of its risk of extinction. “Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools are available to aid the recovery of the species and to protect its habitat,” according to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. “Among these legal tools are the ESA’s prohibition of unpermitted ‘take’ (e.g., killing, capturing, or harming) of endangered species and its requirement that agencies, in consultation with FWS or NMFS as applicable, ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.” The ESA routinely stirs debate, and Wheeler is not the first Republican official to question the law’s effectiveness by noting the relatively small number of delisted species. “While most demographic groups support species conservation to some degree, that support is stronger among urban and suburban populations and less so in rural areas, and is stronger among those along the coasts and less so in central and mountain states,” according to the CRS report, which adds that “some industries (e.g., logging and land development) generally see the ESA as a serious problem, while others (e.g., some commercial fishing and many recreation interests) see it as generally supporting their interests.” As part of its deregulatory agenda to support such industries as oil and gas, the Trump administration has finalized new rules that could shrink the habitat set aside for wildlife while allowing more oil and gas drilling on those lands. The new regulations from the Commerce and Interior departments, which are not retroactive, also “remove tools that officials use to predict future harm to species as a result of climate change” and “reveal for the first time in the law’s 45-year history the financial costs of protecting” endangered or threatened species, as The Washington Post’s Darryl Fears reported Monday. Only Congress can change the wording of the law, but the executive branch has discretion to interpret what it says and how to enforce it. Therefore, regulatory changes can have big practical effects. As The Post reported, had the Trump administration’s new rules been in place in 2010, it would have been nearly impossible to designate the polar bear as a threatened species. The decision to add the polar bear to the list in 2010 was made because of melting sea ice in the Arctic. The Trump administration’s regulatory changes are set to take effect in the coming weeks. Here’s a rundown of other key elements in the package, from The Post’s report on Monday: In the Fox Business interview, Wheeler defended the moves and said the ESA “hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species.” “Administrator Wheeler’s statement is accurate, 47 out of 1,900 is considered ‘very few,’ ” said EPA spokesman Michael Abboud. As noted above, government statistics show that 47 species of plants and animals deemed at risk under the ESA have been “recovered” or taken off the list, out of nearly 2,000 that have appeared. Another 18 species are being considered for delisting. The ratio of listed-to-recovered species is low, but by focusing on that ratio, Wheeler takes a straitjacketed view of what it means to be successful in wildlife conservation. Scientists have credited the ESA with bringing back from the brink of extinction such iconic species as the bald eagle, the grizzly bear, the California condor, the American alligator, the peregrine falcon, the humpback whale, the black-footed ferret, the Florida manatee, the Tennessee purple coneflower and others. As the Congressional Research Service found: So, as of 2016, focusing on the number of delisted species produced a low success rate of less than 1 percent. But focusing on species that had improved or stabilized their population — short of the U.S. government’s threshold for delisting — produced a success rate of 41 percent, based on a 2015 study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. J. Michael Scott, an emeritus professor in the fish and wildlife department of the University of Idaho, previously told PolitiFact that studies suggest “more than half of the endangered and threatened populations are stable or improving, and that percentage increases with the length of time the species has been protected.” In its fact check of former Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.), PolitiFact found that, as of 2013, “only one-half of 1 percent of species placed on the list have become extinct, which works out to a success rate of over 99 percent plus” and that “one could just as easily say that less than 1 percent of the species placed on the list have become extinct, and that many species have improved without being delisted.” Extinction, of course, is part of the circle of life. Ask the dinosaurs. But “many scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background extinction rates over time,” the CRS report noted. A Trump administration official said: “Delisting a species is the ultimate goal of ESA as it shows that the species is fully recovered with a strong scientific record. Settling for population improvements or some habitat recovery is not something this administration is willing to do. Recovery remains our ambitious goal.” Wildlife conservation efforts take many years to work, and the U.S. government’s scientific threshold for a “recovered” species is set high. Focusing on that metric, as Wheeler did, gives an incomplete view of how the Endangered Species Act works. Studies show that 40 percent to nearly half of at-risk species have improved or stabilized their populations under ESA protection. Many of these plants and animals may be delisted one day; some species may never be delisted and still be considered saved. Wheeler described the 47 delisted species out of nearly 2,000 as a low batting average. He said the law “hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species” and also said “we’ve recovered very few species.” Although his comments are technically accurate (especially when he uses the term “recovered,” which is the government’s term for delisted species), the EPA chief leaves out the population gains before species are delisted, which in many cases are substantial.

HONOLULU, Hawaii — An update to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, which assesses the extinction risk of the world’s plants, animals and fungi, was released here Sunday — and it moves a key gorilla subspecies, Congo’s Grauer’s gorilla, to “critically endangered” status. Just 3,800 Grauer’s gorilla remain — a sharp decline in numbers for the world’s largest gorilla, and one largely driven by geopolitical upheaval as the Rwandan genocide drove large numbers of refugees into the gorilla’s habitat. The sharp decline of Grauer’s gorilla meant that the larger species to which it belongs, the Eastern gorilla —which also includes the mountain gorilla — was listed as “critically endangered.” The international meeting, which convenes every four years, is the world’s largest environmental decision-making forum, bringing together heads of state and other government officials, civilians, indigenous peoples, business leaders and academics to address the world’s biggest conservation challenges. More than 8,000 delegates from 184 countries are in attendance. The IUCN uses the Red List to classify organisms according to the severity of their extinction risk; in descending order of threat, the categories are “critically endangered,” “endangered,” “vulnerable,” “near threatened” and “least concern,” The list also includes categories for extinct and data-deficient species. Of the 82,954 species assessed, more than a quarter are threatened with extinction. Arguably the biggest update to the Red List on Sunday was its report on the decline of the Grauer’s gorilla, one of two subspecies of the Eastern gorilla and the world’s largest living primate. The subspecies was moved from “endangered” to “critically endangered” after a report by the Wildlife Conservation Society and Flora & Fauna International released earlier this year, which found devastating population declines due to illegal hunting and civil unrest. John Robinson, a primatologist and chief conservation officer at the Wildlife Conservation Society, cites the Rwandan genocide as a major driver of the decline in Grauer’s gorillas. The exodus of Rwandan refugees had ripple effects: As people moved into eastern Congo, other people in the region were displaced. “Big populations ended up in some of the protected areas, which were relatively uninhabited,” Robinson said. This opened up the protected areas to artisanal mining, charcoal extraction and bushmeat hunting. Over the past 20 years, 77 percent of Grauer’s gorillas have been lost; a 2015 assessment finds that just 3,800 Grauer’s gorilla remain, compared with 16,900 in 1994. Four of the six great ape species — the Eastern gorilla, Western gorilla, Bornean orangutan and  Sumatran orangutan — are now listed as “critically endangered,” while the chimpanzee and bonobo are listed as “endangered.” And there were other dismaying updates, as well, on Sunday. The Plains zebra has moved from “least concern” to “near threatened” after a 24 percent population decline over the past 14 years — down from about 660,000 to 500,000 animals. They are found only in protected areas in many of their range countries, yet many range states still report population declines. They are threatened by hunting for their meat and skins. Three species of African antelope — bay duiker, white-bellied duiker and yellow-backed duiker — also have moved from “least concern” to “near threatened.” Populations within protected areas are relatively stable, but elsewhere they are threatened with illegal hunting and habitat loss. Koalas have moved from “least concern” to “near threatened,” as well. Habitat destruction and fragmentation, brushfires, disease and drought have all taken a toll on Australia’s favorite marsupial. While management plans are in place, they require improvements; a recent parliamentary inquiry concluded that Australia’s conservation and management strategy was largely ineffective. The latest IUCN assessment also shows that of the 415 endemic Hawaiian plants assessed, 87 percent are threatened with extinction. Thirty-eight plants have been listed as extinct, and four are listed as extinct in the wild. Invasive species, such as pigs, goats, rats and slugs, as well as non-native plants, have imperiled Hawaii’s flora, and the IUCN Species Survival Commission Hawaiian Plant Specialist Group anticipates that the remaining species to be assessed also will be highly threatened. “[The IUCN Red List] has to drive imperative and important conservation action or we will lose these species forever,” said IUCN Director General Inger Anderson. “Once they are gone, they really are gone.” Amid this bad news, there are signs of hope, as well. Two endemic Hawaiian plants thought to be extinct — Mark’s Cyanea and Hairy Wikstroemia — were rediscovered during the most recent assessment. And several other species have been down-listed, indicating that conservation actions are working. The giant panda was moved from “endangered” to “vulnerable,” as its population has grown as a result of effective forest protection and reforestation efforts by China. “We’ve kept it in the vulnerable category because there are concerns about climate change,” said Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the Red List Unit. Bamboos are quite sensitive to climate change, and models show that 35 percent of the bamboo that pandas rely could be wiped out over the next 80 years. “All the good work done by Chinese authorities on the ground could be easily be undone by a threat which is caused by the global community, not just the Chinese,” Hilton-Taylor said. Another success story due to conservation action is the Tibetan antelope, which has moved from “endangered” to “near threatened.” After a severe population decline due to poaching in the 1980s and early 1990s, which brought the animals down from 1 million to an estimated 65,000 to 72,500, rigorous protection measures have been enacted and enforced, bringing the population back up to between 100,000 and 150,000. Two Australian species have seen an upswing, as well: the greater stick-nest Rat, which moved from “vulnerable” to “near threatened” and the bridled nailtail wallaby, which moved from “endangered” to “vulnerable.” On Saturday night, the IUCN, its Species Survival Commission and nine Red List partner institutions committed to supporting the IUCN Red List, pledging more than $10 million over the next five years toward achieving a goal of assessing 160,000 species by 2020. “Our goal is to make that IUCN Red List an even more complete barometer for life and, therefore, being a real driver for action,” Anderson said.

You can find their images on T-shirts, coffee mugs and even bumper stickers. Their immense gray and white bodies have graced many a “save the whales” poster. For more than 40 years, the humpback whale has been an icon of the wildlife conservation movement — majestic, globally beloved and always teetering on the edge of extinction. Until now, that is. A new report from the federal government says the humpback has actually recovered in leaps and bounds since it was first granted protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the 1970s. And now, the government wants to give everybody’s favorite whale a fresh start. On Monday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a proposal that would divide the whale into 14 distinct population segments, instead of one large population, and would remove federal protection from 10 of the segments. Of the remaining four population segments, two would keep their endangered status and two would be relisted as threatened. [Video: Pod of humpback whales surround fisherman in Norway] This is a major shift for the humpbacks, which have spent the last few decades soldiering back from the brink of extinction. The Wildlife Conservation Society estimates that, at their lowest point, some humpback populations sank to just 2 percent of their original size, suffering the dramatic effects of commercial hunting. Since then, a ban on commercial whaling and a many-pronged conservation effort, bolstered by national and international initiatives such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the efforts of the International Whaling Commission, have helped the whales build their numbers back up. In many ways, the humpback has been a “keystone to conservation efforts around the world,” says Howard Rosenbaum, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Ocean Giants program. Additionally, the global attention the humpback has received over the years has made it one of the world’s best known and most charismatic species. Their distinctive display behavior — the jumps and breaches that delight whale watchers — and their breathtaking “singing” have made them favorites of wildlife enthusiasts around the world. So it’s no surprise that NOAA’s recent proposal drew media attention from around the world. Citing population rebounds and continued population growth, the agency hailed the decision as an “ESA success story,” said Eileen Sobeck, assistant administrator for fisheries at NOAA, in a statement. “As we learn more about the species — and realize the populations are largely independent of each other — managing them separately allows us to focus protection on the animals that need it the most.” [Video: Rare Albino humpback whale spotted off Australian coast] It’s just a proposal for now, and the agency has opened a 90-day comment period for citizens to voice their thoughts before it makes a final decision. But even if the proposal becomes a rule, does that mean we can finally stop worrying about the humpback whale? Not so fast, experts say. Rosenbaum, of the Wildlife Conservation Society, cautions that the humpback’s journey isn’t over yet. Under the ESA’s specific listing criteria, 10 of the newly designated humpback populations are no longer threatened by extinction, which is the requirement for “endangered” status. But while the proposal should be taken as a good sign, Rosenbaum says, it doesn’t mean that the whales have made it all the way back to the numbers they had before whaling became a problem. Some populations still have a long way to go before they reach those levels again. In fact, some conservationists say it’s too soon to propose delisting the whales at all, citing a range of risks that could still threaten the species in the future. “We’re not embracing this as a great next step,” says Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation–North America. In addition to ocean noise, pollution, habitat degradation and other risk factors, she says, the two biggest threats to humpback whales today are becoming tangled in nets and getting hit by boats, concerns shared by other conservationists. [Photo gallery: A crossroads for the ‘Save the Whales’ movement] Another complicating factor is the looming threat of climate change, which many scientists expect will become an increasing problem for marine organisms in the future. Miyoko Sakashita, oceans director at the Center for Biological Diversity, says the biggest concern about climate change is how it will affect the whales’ food sources. Some studies suggest that changing ocean temperatures and currents could drive the small fish and other organisms that humpbacks and other whales feed on to different regions of the ocean, meaning whales might have to change their migration patterns to keep up. Sakashita adds that ocean acidification, which happens when the ocean absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is another threat to some of the organisms humpback whales eat, such as plankton. These tiny marine creatures protect themselves by building shells out of calcium carbonate. But as the ocean grows more acidic, plankton have trouble pulling the right chemicals out of the ocean to make their shells. “It’s not clear if the abundance of plankton will be the same [in the future],” Sakashita says. These are all issues the federal government considered in its proposal. The report examined a wide range of potential threats to the species, including coastal development, environmental contaminants, disease, man-made ocean noise, net entanglement and vessel strikes. For some of these factors, NOAA acknowledged that there was not enough data to say for sure what their future effects might be. But, at least for the 10 populations recommended for delisting, the agency determined that the combined potential risks were not an extinction threat. Climate change wasn’t left out of the picture, either. In fact, NOAA Fisheries examines the potential effects of climate change in any ESA-related decision, a NOAA press officer confirmed, including listing, delisting and reclassifying species. Acknowledging that climate change “has received considerable attention in recent years,” the authors of the proposal examined the threat it poses to each of the 14 proposed humpback populations. For the 10 they recommend delisting, they concluded that the climate threat was either unknown or not severe enough, in combination with the other future challenges humpbacks might face, to warrant keeping their ESA protection. They also cited data to suggest that humpbacks are likely to redistribute, or shift their ranges, in response to climate-related pressures. Further reviews are in store before any final decisions are made about the species’ listing status. In the meantime, Rosenbaum says it’s important to make sure the NOAA proposal doesn’t lead to misunderstandings about the humpbacks’ actual recovery status, which will require continued effort from conservationists. “I think it’s a positive sign that these populations are recovering, and I think it shows when the acts are enacted and enforced and monitored that they can be effective,” he says. “There’s progress, but there’s more work to do to ensure their full recovery.” Read more: A gray whale migrated nearly 14,000 miles, setting record Tourist dies after a whale slams into a sightseeing boat off Mexican coast More humpback whales getting spotted approaching New York City  	627	"[{""start"": 1185, ""end"": 1665, ""text"": ""The Wildlife Conservation Society estimates that, at their lowest point, some humpback populations sank to just 2 percent of their original size, suffering the dramatic effects of commercial hunting.

"Attorneys general in 17 states on Wednesday made good on a promise to sue the Trump administration over rule changes that substantially weakened how Endangered Species Act protections are considered and enforced. The attorneys general vowed to challenge the administration in mid-August when the Interior and Commerce departments announced new rules that would allow officials to decrease the amount of habitat threatened and endangered animals require to survive and remove tools used by scientists to predict future harm to species as a result of climate change. The administration would also be allowed to reveal, for the first time in the 45 years since the act was signed into law by the Nixon administration, the financial burden of protecting wildlife. Revealing the price tag and loss of potential development opportunities on protected land could open future threatened and endangered designations to challenges they have not face before now. Before the change, the act called for endangered plants and animals to be protected regardless of the cost. The rules were changed as part of President Trump’s effort to scale back government regulations on corporations, including the oil and gas industry, that want to drill on protected land. “The revisions finalized with this rulemaking fit squarely within the president’s mandate of easing the regulatory burden on the American public, without sacrificing our species’ protection and recovery goals,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in August. “These changes were subject to a robust, transparent public process, during which we received significant public input that helped us finalize these rules.” Over nearly a half century, the Endangered Species Act has been credited with saving the bald eagle, American alligator, Florida manatee, grizzly bear, California condor, humpback whale and other animals from extinction. More than 1,500 plants and animals are currently listed as endangered or threatened. “We’re going to try to undo what the president is proposing to do with the Endangered Species Act,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) said during a news conference that was streamed online. Becerra added that the coalition was “coming out swinging” to protect an act that plants and animals depend on. Led by California, Maryland and Massachusetts, the coalition filed its complaint in a federal court in California. Attorneys general in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also signed on to the lawsuit. Washington, D.C., and New York City are also in the coalition. The coalition released a statement saying the administration’s rollback of rules “removes current provisions that help prevent threatened species from becoming endangered or extinct.” Among them are rules that ban capturing and killing some species, it said. Nick Goodwin, an Interior Department spokesman, said in an email that the regulatory changes “are long overdue and necessary."" He predicted that they “will recover more imperiled species facing extinction than previously accomplished over the span of this law.” He said that the administration will defend its rules in court. ""We will be steadfast in our implementation of this important act to improve conservation efforts across the country,” Goodwin said. The rule changes followed a United Nations report that said 1 million species worldwide face extinction as a result of human activity. Wednesday’s lawsuit came on the heels of a separate report that 3 billion birds have been lost since the 1970s. Considering those stakes, Becerra bemoaned the administration’s actions. “Why we have to do a press conference on this is beyond me,” he said. Becerra has filed more than 60 challenges to actions by the administration, 30 involving the environment. In a statement, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) also criticized the timing of the administration’s change. “As we face a climate emergency and global extinction crisis threatening more than a million species, the Trump Administration is gutting Endangered Species Act protections to pave the way for oil and gas developments,” Healey said. “We are suing to defend federal law and protect our imperiled wildlife and environment.” Theirs was the second coalition to challenge the administration. The lawsuit mirrors a complaint filed by environmental and animal rights groups about a week after the changes were announced. Like the attorneys, the conservationists argue that the administration failed to disclose how the changes would affect the environment, in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act. Some of the final rules “were never made public,” the conservationists said, cutting American citizens “out of the decision-making process.” The earlier court challenge was filed by Earthjustice for the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, National Parks Conservation Association, WildEarth Guardians, and the Humane Society of the United States. “California is home to hundreds of endangered and threatened species, and wildlife that owes its continued existence to the Endangered Species Act, including the iconic bald eagle,” Becerra said. “As we face the unprecedented threat of a climate emergency, now is the time to strengthen our planet’s biodiversity, not to destroy it.”"	640	"[{""start"": 760, ""end"": 950, ""text"": ""Revealing the price tag and loss of potential development opportunities on protected land could open future threatened and endangered designations to challenges they have not face before no"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3451, ""end"": 3525, ""text"": ""1 million species worldwide face extinction as a result of human activity."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4011, ""end"": 4111, ""text"": ""As we face a climate emergency and global extinction crisis threatening more than a million species,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 760, ""end"": 950, ""text"": ""ling the price tag and loss of potential development opportunities on protected land could open future threatened and endangered designations to challenges they have not face before now"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	616	2023-04-14T19:18:12.614162Z	2023-04-14T19:18:12.614229Z	462.662
The Trump administration adopted a rule Tuesday that could shrink the historic habitats of plants and animals threatened with extinction, an action that opponents say will make it more difficult for them to recover. On their way out of office, the directors of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service established a rule that changed the definition of what determines a habitat under the Endangered Species Act. It was the second major rollback the administration has made to the signature wildlife protection law. Under the new definition, only “critical habitat” that can sustain the species in question can be protected, as opposed to a broader habitat the plant or animal might one day occupy if it is suitable. “This action will bring greater clarity and consistency to how the Service designates critical habitat,” Rob Wallace, assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks, said in a statement. “Making the Endangered Species Act more effective at conserving imperiled wildlife and more transparent and user friendly for stakeholders represents a win-win for everyone.” Conservationists immediately denounced the change as favoring developers over wildlife that has been put at risk by human activity. Under the previous rule, the immediate living space of species designated as endangered or threatened was protected. It also could include areas that species once inhabited but that became unsuitable after development or climate impacts altered the ecology — these were recognized as areas that scientists could try to restore. But the new rule will is more likely to open such areas to agriculture, logging or other development. “This is yet another blow to endangered species from an administration that subscribes to a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ approach to bedrock wildlife laws,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and chief executive of Defenders of Wildlife, a liberal conservation group. “This clearly favors developers and industry, making it easier for the most vulnerable wildlife to slip through the cracks.” Two years ago, the Interior Department made key changes to the act, including allowing officials to consider economic impacts such as losses of jobs and revenue in deciding whether a species should be classified as endangered or threatened. Clark, a director of the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Bill Clinton, said the new definition of habitat contradicts the purpose of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which seeks to save wildlife from extinction by preserving and restoring existing and historic habitats. Other groups joined Clark in saying they would press the incoming Biden administration to review and change the rule. It takes about a year to draft a rule, propose it, seek public comment, address concerns and write a final draft. The conservation group Earthjustice said the new rule was hastily created and would be challenged in federal court. Environmental groups have been largely successful in challenging rules adopted since 2017 by the Interior Department, which oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service. “The Trump administration finalized this rule just under the wire to make it harder for species to survive and recover — the exact opposite of what we should be doing under the Endangered Species Act,” said Earthjustice’s Addie Haughey. “We urge President-elect Biden … to take a hard look at this anti-science rule next year.” But the Trump administration said the reason for the rule change is far more complicated than how opponents characterize it. The administration says that in making the change, policymakers responded to a 2018 Supreme Court decision that found that protection of endangered habitats went too far. The court ruled that critical habitat should be narrowly defined so that it doesn’t unnecessarily intrude on the rights of farmers, home builders, loggers and landowners. “Today’s final definition of habitat will continue to improve implementation of the ESA and will address a 2018 Supreme Court ruling in a case regarding dusky gopher frog critical habitat that any area designated as critical habitat must also be habitat for the species,” according to a statement provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service. “They’re obligated to do this rule under the Supreme Court decision,” said Michael Mittelholzer, assistant vice president for regulatory affairs for the National Association of Home Builders. In Weyerhaeuser v. the Fish and Wildlife Service, a developer argued that it was being harmed by an endangered habitat designation aimed at benefiting the gopher frog, which wasn’t present on the land and had not been for decades. A divided court ruled in favor of the developer. “The Endangered Species Act regulates what critical habitat is, but there is no limiting factor on what’s noncritical habitat,” Mittelholzer said. “As much as the other side wants to do this, it was not Congress’s intent when it established the act. The way we’re impacted when we’re doing normal land development activities is we become subject to the ESA if a species is not there and will never be there.” Jonathan Wood, a senior attorney at the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which supported the rule change, said it will force officials to consider whether designating an area as critical habitat is likely to contribute to the recovery of a species. “The new definition rightly excludes areas that are not currently habitat but merely could become habitat with substantial effort by landowners,” Wood said. Critical habitat designations “dramatically reduce land values,” whether it rightly falls under the category or not, and “landowners won’t invest time and energy into habitat restoration. The available evidence suggests that critical habitat designations have failed to encourage species’ recovery on private land.” But dismissing a species habitat simply because the animal or plant is no longer present is unfair, conservationists say, arguing that human development fragmented the land, driving away wildlife or dividing their populations, which hampered their ability to mate and reproduce. “Our most vulnerable species are barely clinging to survival after being forced from their homes into smaller and smaller spaces,” Stephanie Kurose, a policy specialist for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “We can’t expect them to ever recover if we don’t protect the areas [where] they once lived. “President Trump has cemented his legacy as the most anti-wildlife president in history,” Kurose said. “Today’s rule will have devastating consequences for some of America’s most iconic species, including the grizzly bear, whooping cranes and Pacific salmon.”	639	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 214, ""text"": ""mp administration adopted a rule Tuesday that could shrink the historic habitats of plants and animals threatened with extinction, an action that opponents say will make it more difficult for them to recover"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6562, ""end"": 6718, ""text"": ""“Today’s rule will have devastating consequences for some of America’s most iconic species, including the grizzly bear, whooping cranes and Pacific salmon."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6563, ""end"": 6718, ""text"": ""Today’s rule will have devastating consequences for some of America’s most iconic species, including the grizzly bear, whooping cranes and Pacific salmon."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	615	2023-04-14T19:10:27.583879Z	2023-04-14T19:10:27.583980Z	481.343
Much ink has been spilled in the past few weeks — and rightly so — about the imminent threats to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) posed by the Trump administration and its allies in Congress. Critics of recently proposed policy changes — reducing protections for species deemed “threatened,” making it easier to consider economic factors in the decision to list species as endangered and generally clearing the way for faster approval of energy projects — regard them as thinly veiled giveaways to industry lobbyists and interests, rolling back regulations to favor resource extraction and risking extinction of some species. The lobbyists pushing these policies have based their critique of the ESA on how it attempts to control land use rather than species conservation. After all, they argue, it’s not the endangered land act. And this critique spotlights the core debate over the ESA’s implementation dating back to Day One: Is it about controlling lands or species? While the ESA’s ostensible focus is on the latter, scientists have long argued that the former is essential — and not just to preserve species. For decades, the ESA been a critical signal — and legal recognition — of the many diverse values offered by nature, not merely its economic value as “natural resources.” To roll back this landmark act would be to surrender land and wildlife to relentless cost/benefit analysis and commodification. Far from a perversion of its original intent, as the ESA’s critics maintain, its focus on land use has been intrinsic from the beginning. As enacted in 1973 (and subsequently amended), Section Four requires the interior secretary to “designate critical habitat” for endangered species, Section Five provides for land acquisition for conservation, and Section Nine prohibits “taking” endangered species — a broad, and contentious, prohibition on harming wildlife on state and private lands. By the end of 1975, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had created regulations that specified the meaning of “take.” It clarified the term to also include “environmental modification or degradation” that had the potential to “harm” wildlife (and therefore posed a threat to protected species). This was not just wordsmithing. Rather, these were new restrictions that had huge ramifications. Combined with a series of court cases, legislative amendments and administrative decisions, the ESA and federal agencies began to focus on protecting habitats as the means to preserve species, with serious consequences for everything from property rights to public works projects. The first such consequence, prompting major changes to the ESA, came in the wake of a 1978 Supreme Court decision. The court allowed a small fish to hold up the construction of a Tennessee Valley Authority damming project. The court pointed out that, as written, the ESA clearly prohibited the endangerment of the listed species, regardless of how much money had  been spent on the dam. And so, to prevent future investments from being stalled by creatures like the snail darter, Congress amended the ESA to make it more complicated to add species to the endangered list. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan all but halted species listing by restricting funding and signing an executive order calling for economic review of all federal government actions. But this didn’t spell the beginning of an inexorable hollowing out of the ESA. In response, Congress again amended the ESA in 1982 to reaffirm the original intent to make listing decisions solely on the basis of scientific data, excluding economic analysis, and setting firm time limits within which to do so. But this Congress also sought to achieve a balancing act. Much to the chagrin of environmental activists, it also created an “incidental take” permit system that allowed federal or federally permitted activities to harm endangered species if the agency could show that, among other things, “the taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild.” It was these issues — bureaucratic authority, economic considerations and which actions constituted “taking” endangered wildlife — that came to a head in the 1995 Babbitt v. Sweet Home Supreme Court case. In that case, debate over the Northern spotted owl took center stage. A group of logging interests claimed that including owl habitat degradation in the definition of “harm” exceeded the authority and intent of the original legislation. After all, the owls’ habitat infringed on their business. Distinguished biologists from across the country fought back. They argued that the owl was threatened because of human actions like those of the loggers. By destroying the habitat, loggers were putting the owl on the path to extinction. These scientists wrote a court brief explaining that species depend on the larger ecosystems of which they are a part, and therefore “harm” to habitat constituted harm to the species themselves. Furthermore, because ecosystems did not follow legal property lines, “attempting to divide ecosystems, for purposes of habitat conservation measures, between federal and nonfederal land is sheer folly.” They concluded with a fierce defense of the ESA and the need to focus on habitat: “There is no other law like the ESA. No law so boldly states the commitment to respect all forms of life, and strives to understand the human role in evolution. If the ESA does not protect habitat, wherever it be found, then it does not protect species, and it cannot succeed.” The biologists won. Critically, the court accepted the notion that if the government couldn’t protect the land that was so critical to the existence of species, it couldn’t protect the species. Still, government officials sought to achieve a middle ground: The ruling coincided with a push from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to initiate a series of internal reforms that encouraged public-private agreements to balance economic development and wildlife conservation before listing even became necessary. By and large, this state of affairs has persisted to the present: avoiding listing species as “threatened” or “endangered” if possible, listing them (if necessary) based on scientific assessment instead of  economic concerns and — most important — keeping “critical habitat” front and center. But critics have never accepted these ideas. To them, the current understanding of the ESA stretches it beyond its legal authority, distorts its purpose and privileges the well-being of individual species over economic livelihoods of Americans (say, for example, the recently alleged $34 million cost to landowners to save the dusky gopher frog in Louisiana). To them, the ESA is not about saving species at all, but rather a backdoor method of controlling lands — an encroachment on people’s freedom to do as they please with their property that also damages the economy. But separating species and habitat and removing them from their ecological and historical context is disingenuous and dangerous. The Endangered Species Act has always been about preserving fragile populations of plants and animals and the lands upon which they are found — simply because the former can’t be achieved without the latter. From its inception, the law intended to prioritize these goals over economic impacts. But the ESA also has another purpose, one that its critics miss: establishing a shared natural heritage that is valued beyond simple resource extraction. We control land use because, as stated in the original ESA, “fish, wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people.” This goal is critically important, and if the ESA is undercut, we’re doomed to view land solely as an economic commodity.	638	"[{""start"": 4327, ""end"": 4492, ""text"": ""A group of logging interests claimed that including owl habitat degradation in the definition of “harm” exceeded the authority and intent of the original legislatio"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4614, ""end"": 4704, ""text"": ""They argued that the owl was threatened because of human actions like those of the loggers"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2059, ""end"": 2196, ""text"": ""environmental modification or degradation” that had the potential to “harm” wildlife (and therefore posed a threat to protected species)"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2059, ""end"": 2194, ""text"": ""environmental modification or degradation” that had the potential to “harm” wildlife (and therefore posed a threat to protected species"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	614	2023-04-14T19:02:22.596452Z	2023-04-14T19:02:22.596575Z	909.398
With some scientists predicting a sixth mass extinction, the world’s protectors of wildlife acted with a greater sense of urgency at a marathon meeting to toughen regulations against killing such endangered animals as sharks, manta rays and anteaters and trading their remains. By the time the gathering in Johannesburg ended a day early  Tuesday, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, had issued several trade bans, including one for the African grey parrot, favored by animal lovers for its ability to mimic human speech. CITES also moved to shut down the black-market trade of an exotic anteater called the pangolin, which is killed and sent mostly to China so its scaly skin can be roasted for traditional medicine. “With 183 parties bound by the convention, CITES is the largest conservation agreement in existence,” said Adam M. Roberts, chief executive of Born Free USA. “This meeting represents a clear win for conservation overall — but much work remains.” Conservationists hailed the convention’s 17th meeting, where two African governments were barred from selling their stockpiles of ivory and another from trading away stockpiles of rhino horn, as the most progressive on behalf of animals. “It was a very jam-packed conference,” said Jeff Flocken, North America regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. “This is one where conservation was at the forefront of people’s minds for animals that everyone cares about.” Numerous species that generally are unknown to the public, including the pangolins, thresher sharks and Barbary macaques, “came away with some very strong protections,” he noted.  Delegates at the convention called on Mexico, the United States and China to join forces to block the trade of totoaba, which Mexican fishermen poach with nets for an Asian market, in the process drowning the world’s smallest porpoise, the vaquita. Only 60 vaquita remain. The convention also beat back a proposal by Swaziland to sell legally collected rhinoceros horn that could have masked black-market sales that drive poachers to slaughter at least three of the animals each day. Among other important actions on elephants, it decided to block Namibia and Zimbabwe from selling legally collected ivory for fear that that would provide cover for the illegal trade. Nearly 150,000 African forest and savanna elephants have been slaughtered for their tusks in the past decade. In a last-minute reversal, Botswana, home to the largest populations of elephants, broke from a coalition of nations pushing for the sale of ivory and argued against it. But Flocken called the convention’s moves “a mixed bag” because it defeated a proposal to afford elephants the treaty’s strongest protections under Appendix I. Not every conservation organization expressed the same level of disappointment. The World Wildlife Fund said the decisions on elephants “have closed all potential avenues to a resumption in international ivory trade, paving the way for the world to unite behind efforts to crack down” on the ivory trade. “Now that the debate over whether to trade or not to trade is over,” said Ginette Hemley, who headed the organization’s delegation, “countries around the world must turn the tough talk we have heard here in Johannesburg into tough measures on the ground.” Conservationists faulted the convention for not specifically prohibiting trade of the bones of captive lions in South Africa. Asian markets that covet the bones of tigers, which have mostly disappeared, have turned to the bones of lions and cheetahs for delicacies and cures. But victories overshadowed defeats. CITES took steps to stop mobula rays and devil rays from going from this: To this: Fisheries must now prove that populations of nine species of mobula rays are sustainable, meaning they can recover from large-scale fishing, before they can be taken or traded. Rays were added to the list of species afforded the world’s second-strongest protections under Appendix II. Thresher sharks, valued for the exquisite long tail that they snap to catch prey, won similar protections. “This vote is a huge step towards ensuring the survival of these larger shark and ray species, which continue to be at greatest risk of extinction because of the value of their fins and gills,” Luke Warwick, director of the global shark conservation campaign at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said in a statement. “The call from a record-setting number of governments to protect these species has been answered.” Noting the failure of past efforts to protect African grey parrots, CITES banned their trade completely, allowing governments such as the United States to keep the birds from crossing international borders. “Fraud and corruption have enabled traffickers to vastly exceed current quotas and continue to harvest unsustainable numbers of African grey parrots from Congo’s forests to feed the illegal trade,” said Colman O’Criodain, the World Wildlife Fund’s global wildlife policy manager. “A total ban on international commercial trade . . . is a huge step forward and will help to protect this extraordinary species from the rampant trapping and trading that has contributed to population collapses and local extinctions across Africa in recent decades,” O’Criodain said.

Six months after Cecil the lion was hunted and killed by a Minnesota dentist, it is about to become far more difficult for hunters to import legally any more lion trophies into the United States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is set to declare Monday that two lion subspecies located in India and western and central Africa have been added to the endangered species list, according to officials from the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Humane Society International, two of the petitioners who requested the designation nearly five years ago. “This is going to be a very exciting announcement for those who want to see greater protection for lions,” said Jeff Flocken, the North American regional director of the animal welfare fund. And although the decision is not the direct result of Cecil’s death, but rather new data, he said, “it would be impossible to ignore the public outcry” and its effect on worldwide opinion. Under the rules of the Endangered Species Act, the hunting of lions will not be prevented, but U.S. hunters will be required to obtain an import permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service to bring back trophies. To acquire a permit, a hunter will have “to demonstrate that the hunting and the trophy enhance survival of the species,” said Teresa Telecky, the director of wildlife at the Humane Society International. “This is a very high bar,” she said. Lion populations in northern, western and central Africa will be listed as endangered, while the eastern and southern populations, which are slightly more plentiful, will be listed as threatened. “Regardless of endangered or threatened, anywhere [lions] exist, after tomorrow, the hunter will have to get an import permit from U.S. Fish and Wildlife,” Telecky said. Officials at U.S. Fish and Wildlife did not immediately return calls for comment, but Telecky and Flocken, who said they have spoken directly with the agency, said they think the decision is based chiefly on a study released this summer by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which indicated that fewer than 30,000 lions in Africa were still in existence and perhaps as few as 20,000. In the past 21 years, according to the report, the lion population has declined 60 percent, and the animals now exist in only 8 percent of their historic range. “Habitat and loss of prey are top [reasons for the decline], but poorly regulated trophy hunting was one of the biggest threats mentioned in their assessment,” Telecky said. “Another huge and emerging threat: the trade in lion bones to Asia, where they’re used in traditional Asian medicine.” The lion is now the last big cat to join tigers, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars and cougars on the endangered species list. The new regulation will not prevent the hunting of lions, if the host country permits it, but trophies such as skins and heads cannot be imported into the United States without the required permit. Lions remain one of the most coveted animals of big game trophy hunters, and Americans represent the largest number of trophy takers. In the past 10 years, Telecky said, parts of 5,647 lions were imported into the United States. The petition of the Humane Society and others took on renewed significance in July after Cecil, a 13-year-old black-maned big cat, was lured from his Zimbabwe sanctuary and legally killed by Walter Palmer of Minnesota. Although the dentist acknowledged that he was the hunter, he said he did not know that the lion he had killed had a name and was a beloved tourist attraction. What followed his identification, however, was weeks of worldwide vitriol that forced Palmer to temporarily close his practice and move with his family into hiding.	636	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 194, ""text"": ""nths after Cecil the lion was hunted and killed by a Minnesota dentist, it is about to become far more difficult for hunters to import legally any more lion trophies into the United State"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2326, ""end"": 2498, ""text"": ""“Habitat and loss of prey are top [reasons for the decline], but poorly regulated trophy hunting was one of the biggest threats mentioned in their assessment,” Telecky said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2501, ""end"": 2618, ""text"": ""Another huge and emerging threat: the trade in lion bones to Asia, where they’re used in traditional Asian medicine.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2938, ""end"": 3070, ""text"": ""ions remain one of the most coveted animals of big game trophy hunters, and Americans represent the largest number of trophy takers"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3011, ""end"": 3070, ""text"": ""nd Americans represent the largest number of trophy takers"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	612	2023-04-14T18:29:44.219488Z	2023-04-14T18:29:44.219544Z	539.401
The federal Endangered Species Act has been called the world’s gold standard for environmental protection. Passed in 1973, it strengthened earlier federal protections for animals that had been nearly wiped out by humans, including bald eagles, humpback whales and California condors. But the act has faced opposition from those who believe it unfairly protects animals that sometimes poach livestock and that it unfairly restricts land use. At a recent hearing to discuss “modernizing the Endangered Species Act,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), head of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the ESA “is not working today.” On the House side, Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said the act “has never been used for the rehabilitation of species. … It’s been used to control the land. We’ve missed the entire purpose of the Endangered Species Act. It has been hijacked.” A former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director at the Senate hearing responded to calls that the law needed a dramatic change by reminding committee members of how the law is viewed in other parts of the world. “The Endangered Species Act is the world’s gold standard” for conservation and protection of animals, said Daniel M. Ashe, now president and chief executive of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. “It’s not perfect. It can be better,” Ashe, “Your goal is to make it … stronger and better,” Ashe said. The world’s flora and fauna are experiencing a global extinction crisis caused by human activity, according to many experts. But humans have also learned how to protect species and help them make a recovery. Here are eight species that would probably have disappeared already were it not for the Endangered Species Act. Black-footed ferret If raccoons could get plastic surgery, they’d transform themselves into black-footed ferrets. This variety of ferrets is the only one that’s native to the Americas, but Americans are shoving them off their habitat with development, and they inadvertently introduced a plague to their primary food source, prairie dogs. Along with development that causes prairie dogs to scatter, the sylvatic plague, which caused the bubonic plague in humans, wiped out entire prairie dog populations and spread to ferrets. Black-footed ferrets exist on about 2 percent of their historic range. Listed as endangered in 1967, they were twice considered extinct in the 20th century before a population of about 20 was found. the Fish and Wildlife Service partnered with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Va., and zoos to breed the animals in captivity and reintroduce them into the wild in a bid to save them. The federal agency is also experimenting with using drones to scatter plague vaccine, encased in peanut butter tablets, to protect the animals against disease. There have been hopeful signs of a small rebound, but as development continues to slice up their habitat, their fate is still dicey. Humpback whale This is the famous singing whale. No one really knows why, but males, who do all the crooning, sing for up to 20 minutes at a time, sometimes all day, pausing only for a breath — an underwater opera. The singing nearly stopped in the 1960s, when more than a century of commercial hunting took its toll. Humpback whales were listed as endangered in 15 habitats worldwide, and their numbers fell to 1,600. They were listed as endangered in 1967 under the Endangered Species Conservation Act that preceded the current act. Nearly five decades later, they’ve rebounded to about 20,000 individuals across the world, enough to be de-listed in all but a few of their habitats. Bald eagle The bald eagle was designated as the national bird in 1782, just before the end of the Revolutionary War. Although the Americans and British stopped fighting, hostilities didn’t end for eagles. Name a threat, and bald eagles have faced it: illegal shooting, poisoning, habitat destruction and contamination of its food with the deadly chemical DDT. By the 1970s, when they were listed as endangered, bald eagles were on the verge of extinction. Wildlife officials teamed up with state and federal lawmakers to save them. The first step was to ban DDT, ushering in a bald eagle recovery through conservation, including the protection of nesting areas. Bald eagle populations recently climbed to an estimated 70,000 birds from a low of about 400 breeding pairs in 1963, a recovery that the Fish and Wildlife Service called remarkable. They were removed from the endangered list in 2007. American alligator Why does this member of the crocodile family look so scary? It’s basically a dinosaur. Alligators have been on Earth for 200 million years, hunting other animals and devouring them. Gators aren’t the only merciless animal. Humans nearly put an end to their existence through hunts and habitat destruction. Like the black-footed ferret, alligators were listed as endangered in 1967. Authorities banned hunting to protect it, the American alligator quickly rebounded, and in 1987 the service declared that the animal had fully recovered. American alligators exist from North Carolina to Florida on the Atlantic coast and from Florida to Texas on the Gulf coast. They abound in the Florida Everglades, where invasive Burmese pythons have begun to challenge them for the top spot on the food chain. Grizzly bear There’s no mistaking a grizzly bear. Its powerful build, its walk and claws are iconic. Those features are part of the reason scientists named grizzlies Ursus horribilis, “terrifying bear.” Biologists don’t like the term grizzly. They’re a subspecies of the Kodiak bear and are officially the North American brown bear. Other North American bears such as the polar bear are bigger. But grizzlies have a fearsome reputation. Some wonder why, considering that they are largely solitary, playful and can be communal eaters in areas where food is plentiful. Humans fear them, but grizzlies have proven no match for humans. Half a million grizzlies once roamed the Lower 48 states, from the northwestern corner of Washington to southern Wyoming. Now only about 1,800 remain. Grizzlies were listed as threatened in the lower 48 states in 1975 after being reduced to 2 percent of their historic range. In their southernmost territory, inside Yellowstone National Park, they were fiercely protected, and hunting outside the park was ended. The bears’ numbers have grown from about 130 to 700 in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and now Fish and Wildlife is considering removing them from the list, sparking an ongoing fight with ranchers on one side, conservationists on the other and the federal government in the middle. Florida manatee Manatees have lived in Florida for about 45 million years, according to fossil records. They are big, gray, lumbering and docile marine mammals, plus they eat sea grasses, so people call them sea cows. As Florida developed into a vacation and retirement paradise that swelled its population to 20 million, making it the fourth-most-populous state, sea cows found themselves in the path of boats. Sharp propellers butcher the animals, and they are harassed by snorkelers and tubers longing to touch them. Florida first acted to protect manatees as far back as 1893, and the federal government first protected them as an endangered species in 1967. Aerial surveys in 1991 proved that their numbers had dropped from the tens of thousands to fewer than 1,300. In 2013, there were a record 800 manatee deaths caused mostly by humans. Faced with the extinction of the Florida manatee, an offshoot of the West Indian manatee that roams the Caribbean and South America, the state and federal government stepped up protections. They created manatee protection zones marked clearly for boaters, worked to minimize harassment, disturbance injury and mortality, and closely monitor the animal’s habitat and population. Manatee numbers are rebounding, with about 6,200 in the most recent annual count. Last year in January, Fish and Wildlife proposed to downgrade their status on the endangered list. California condor They are among the largest flying birds in the world, speeding at up to 55 mph on air currents in a search for carrion such as deer. Thousands of years ago, they weren’t just California condors. They existed as far away as Florida. But like every other animal on this list, it couldn’t overcome human expansion into America. “As people settled the West, they often shot, poisoned, captured and disturbed the condors, collected their eggs, and reduced their food supply of antelope, elk, and other large wild animals. Eventually, condors could no longer survive in most places,” according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. A few remaining condors were backed into the Southern California mountains by the turn of the last century. It’s been illegal for anyone to kill a condor in California for 100 years. But the same chemical that nearly doomed eagles, DDT, was an invisible killer of condors. Compounding the problem, carrion killed by lead shot poisoned birds that fed on the carcasses. They’ve been protected by federal law since 1967 and state law since 1971. By then, they were already too far gone. In 1982, only 23 were left worldwide. Five years later, they were rushed into a captive breeding program for intensive recovery. Without it, condors would probably no longer exist. In 1992, federal officials started releasing a few into the wild, and now there are 410 birds. Although the recovery program says there are “more California condors flying free in the wild” since the program’s start, their survival is still an open question. One of the first things the Interior Department did under its new secretary, Ryan Zinke, was rescind an Obama administration regulation that outlawed hunting with lead shot. Gray wolf The gray wolf, Canis lupis, has a public relations problem that’s hard to overcome. In fables, it menaces Little Red Riding Hood and blows down the houses of pigs. In horror tales, a man unfortunate enough to be bitten by a werewolf transforms into one. But wolves once roamed the whole of North America, the greatest distribution of any wild animal, and were an essential part of the ecology. They helped control populations of deer, elk and bison, ensuring that those animals roamed about rather than ruined areas by remaining too long, trampling the ground and demolishing trees that other animals relied on for habitat and safety. As humans colonized the east and expanded to the west, ranchers came to despise wolf packs that killed cattle on instinct learned over thousands of years of hunting prey. They were hunted, shot, trapped and poisoned throughout the lower 48 states until they were on the brink of extinction. Gray wolves were listed as endangered in 1978. Although some progress was made toward their recovery, they continue to be listed as endangered in 39 states and parts of another five because shooting and trapping still happen. A distinct north Rocky Mountain population was de-listed due to recovery six years ago. Opponents of the endangered listing are working to remove wolves from the list, as conservationists complain that there isn’t a sufficient number to escape extinction. But it’s clear that protection has led to a rebound.

Builders v. Babbitt, 327 U.S. App. D.C. 248, 272 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (Sentelle, J., dissenting). If Congress could use the Commerce Clause to regulate anything that might affect the ecosystem (to say nothing about its effect on commerce), there would be no logical stopping point to congressional power under the Commerce Clause. Accordingly, the asserted biological value of the Utah prairie dog is inconsequential in this case. . . . Defendants’ final argument, that the Necessary and Proper Clause authorizes special rule 4(d) because the rule is essential to the economic scheme created by the ESA, also fails upon close examination. This argument is based on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Raich that a regulation may be upheld when it is an “essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.” 545 U.S. at 24-25. Although the ESA itself regulates some economic activity, the rule in question is not necessary to the statute’s economic scheme. Defendants emphasize that the Supreme Court cited the federal regulation of the take of bald and golden eagles as an example of congressional power that is clearly authorized by the Commerce Clause. (FWS’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 21 (citing Raich, 545 U.S. at 26 n.36).) The Court’s bald eagle example is not surprising because it is consistent with the Court’s ruling in Raich. 545 U.S. 1. . . . The present case, on the other hand, differs significantly from Raich in one important way that makes any appeal to the Necessary and Proper Clause futile: takes of Utah prairie dogs on non-federal land–even to the point of extinction–would not substantially affect the national market for any commodity regulated by the ESA. The only evidence that suggests that the prairie dog’s extinction would substantially affect such a national market is Defendants’ assertion that golden eagles, hawks, and bobcats are “known to prey on prairie dogs.” (FWS’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 29.) However, Defendants do not claim that the Utah prairie dog is a major food source for those animals, and those animals are known to prey on many other rodents, birds, and fish. In other words, there is no evidence that the diminution of the Utah prairie dog on private lands in Utah would significantly alter the supply or quality of animals for which a national market exists. Therefore, congressional protection of the Utah prairie dog is not necessary to the ESA’s economic scheme. The folks at the Pacific Legal Foundation, who litigated the case, have more on today’s decision here.

This afternoon a district court in Utah held that the federal prohibition against “taking” Utah prairie dogs — listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act — exceeds the scope of federal power under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper clauses. Here is how Judge Dee Benson summarized his conclusion in People for the Ethical Treatment of Property Owners v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Although the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to do many things, it does not authorize Congress to regulate takes of a purely intrastate species that has no substantial effect on interstate commerce. Congress similarly lacks authority through the Necessary and Proper Clause because the regulation of takes of Utah prairie dogs is not essential or necessary to the ESA’s economic scheme. This decision is significant if for no other reason that it is the first time that a federal court has held that the regulation of private land use [under the ESA] exceeds the scope of Congress’s enumerated powers.  Judge Benson is not the first judge to have reached this conclusion, however, as the question has split several Circuit courts. Commerce Clause challenges to ESA regulation have produced divided panels on the Fourth, Fifth and D.C. Circuits.  Moreover, although these circuits all reached the same conclusion, they adopted conflicting rationales, a point noted by then-judge John Roberts in his first opinion on the D.C. Circuit.  For those interested, I discussed these cases and their conflicting rationales in this article in the Iowa Law Review (pp. 406-417). At issue in PETPO v FWS, as in the prior Commerce Clause challenges to the ESA, is whether regulations limiting the taking of a listed species is a proper exercise of the federal commerce power.  This turns on whether the taking of such species can be said to “substantially affect” interstate commerce.  The federal government notes that many activities regulated by this prohibition are economic in nature.  Yet the prohibition is not limited to economic or commercial activity. The landowner who wishes to modify Utah prairie dog habitat to plant a garden is regulated just the same as a real estate developer.  Moreover, the prohibition applies whether or not the species in question has any economic value.  As a consequence (and as I discuss in the article linked above) it is not at all clear that the take prohibition can be sustained under the relatively formalist analysis adopted by the Supreme Court in cases like Lopez and Morrison (and now NFIB).  Thus, PETPO argued, the federal government lacks the authority to regulate the taking of an intrastate, non-economically valuable species like the Utah prairie dog.  Judge Benson agreed. Here are some more excerpts from Judge Benson’s opinion: The court agrees with PETPO’s claim that the rule is non-economic because “the Service is regulating every activity, regardless of its nature, if it causes harm to a Utah prairie dog.” (PETPO’s Mot. for Summ. J. at 24.) Additionally, it is undisputed that the rule in question does not contain any jurisdictional element that would limit its reach to takes that have an explicit connection to interstate commerce. (FWS’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 12.) It is also undisputed that there are no express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of taking a Utah prairie dog. Id. Finally, as will be demonstrated below, all of Defendants’ arguments purporting to establish a link between Utah prairie dog takes and a substantial effect on interstate commerce are attenuated. Defendants’ argument that the rule has a substantial effect on interstate commerce because it has frustrated several proposed agricultural and commercial activities misses the mark. The proper focus of the “substantial effect” test is the “regulated activity.” See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 23 (2005). Illustratively, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could regulate the purely local growth and consumption of wheat or marijuana because those activities altered the national market for those commodities. Raich, 545 U.S. 1; Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942). However, the Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the possession of a gun in a known school zone, even though the regulation of that activity affected commerce in a variety of ways (e.g. people could not sell guns in a school zone). Lopez 514 U.S. 549 (1995); see also Morrison 529 U.S. 598 (2000). In other words, the question in the present case is whether take of the Utah prairie dog has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, not whether the regulation preventing the take has such an effect. Consequently, the fact that PETPO members or other persons are prohibited from engaging in commercial activities as a result of special rule 4(d) is irrelevant to the Commerce Clause analysis. Furthermore, Defendants’ argument concerning the biological value of the Utah prairie dog is insufficient to demonstrate that take of the prairie dog has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The Court acknowledges that the Utah prairie dog may have an effect on the ecosystem. Nevertheless, as aptly observed by Chief Judge Sentelle, “[T]he Commerce Clause empowers Congress ‘to regulate commerce’ not ecosystems.’” National Ass’n of Home 	631	"[{""start"": 5048, ""end"": 5132, ""text"": ""he Court acknowledges that the Utah prairie dog may have an effect on the ecosystem"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5048, ""end"": 5132, ""text"": ""The Court acknowledges that the Utah prairie dog may have an effect on the ecosystem"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	607	2023-04-14T14:51:30.480187Z	2023-04-14T14:51:30.480289Z	261.237
