"The Environmental Protection Agency approved broad new applications Friday for a controversial insecticide, despite objections from environmental groups and beekeepers who say it is among the compounds responsible for eviscerating the nation’s bee populations. Alexandra Dunn, head of the EPA office that oversees pesticides, said the agency was “thrilled” to be able to approve new uses and lift past restrictions on sulfoxaflor, which she called a “highly effective” tool for growers around the country — but which the agency itself considers “very highly toxic” to bees. The decision will allow the chemical to be applied to a wide array of crops, including citrus and corn, soybeans and strawberries, pineapples and pumpkins. “EPA is providing long-term certainty for U.S. growers to use an important tool to protect crops and avoid potentially significant economic losses, while maintaining strong protection for pollinators,” Dunn said. The agency’s critics, some of whom successfully sued the EPA in federal court during the Obama administration to restrict use of the pesticide, were anything but thrilled with Friday’s announcement. “At a time when honeybees and other pollinators are dying in greater numbers than ever before, EPA’s decision to remove restrictions on yet another bee-killing pesticide is nothing short of reckless,” Greg Loarie, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, said in an email. The news comes during a time that commercial honeybee colonies have been declining at a startling rate. The annual loss rate for honeybees during the year ending in April rose to 40.7 percent, up slightly over the annual average of 38.7 percent, according to the Bee Informed Partnership, a nonprofit group associated with the University of Maryland. Some of the losses have been associated with events such as massive wildfires in the west, the wet winter in the Midwest and hurricanes in the Southeast. But the bee losses documented over the past decade are often blamed in no small part on the increased use of fungicides, herbicides and certain pesticides. Sulfoxaflor was initially approved by the EPA in 2013, but a collection of beekeepers and other opponents sued the agency over its use, saying studies made it clear that it was highly toxic to honeybees. In 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that federal regulators lacked adequate data to show the pesticide did not pose serious risk to pollinators, and the court vacated the agency’s approval of sulfoxaflor. In 2016, the EPA approved use of the pesticide for crops that do not attract bees, as well as for use on certain plants after blooming was complete. The agency also has repeatedly granted emergency waivers to states to allow the use of sulfoxaflor on certain crops because of a lack of effective alternatives for farmers — including more than a dozen such exemptions this year alone for sorghum and cotton. ""That helps you see how important a tool this is,” Dunn told reporters Friday. In deciding to grant broad approval to sulfoxaflor, Dunn said the agency relied on a host of new, industry-backed studies that showed the insecticide dissipates in the environment more quickly than widely used alternatives, thereby lowering the risk to bees. In addition, the agency said sulfoxaflor often requires fewer applications than other insecticides, resulting in reduced risks to wildlife. “Our data on this insecticide is among EPA’s largest data sets on the effects of a pesticide on bees,” Dunn told reporters, saying the agency had carefully considered its risks and benefits. “EPA highly values pollinator protection.” She added that farmers must still abide by numerous restrictions when using the pesticide. For instance, it can be applied to certain tree fruits, berries and other crops only after they have bloomed. Restrictions also exist to prevent drifting of the pesticide in windy conditions. Corteva, the agricultural division of DowDuPont, welcomed the EPA’s approval for what it called “critical” uses of the pesticide, saying in a statement Friday that “growers should have access to tools that can be used safely according to the product label.” The Agricultural Retailers Association, which represents suppliers of seed and other products to farmers and ranchers, also praised the EPA’s decision. “It is encouraging to see EPA take a hard look at the science about sulfoxaflor and its effects on pollinators and issue a science-based decision on its permitted use,” the group’s president, Daren Coppock, said in a statement. “This is how the system is supposed to work: scientific experts making science-based decisions.” But Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health program, called Friday’s decision little more than a gift to industry, and one that did not come with public input. “Their failure to provide any notice of this decision is a new low for this administration,” Burd said in an interview. “But the worst part of this is that they know the effect; they know how significant this is. And yet they are allowing this even with the full knowledge we are in a pollinator extinction crisis.” Burd said she expects opponents to soon take EPA to court once again over the pesticide. “Their job is to weigh the risks versus the benefits,” she said. “But they are just touting the benefits and sweeping the risks under the rug.”"	548	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 260, ""text"": ""e Environmental Protection Agency approved broad new applications Friday for a controversial insecticide, despite objections from environmental groups and beekeepers who say it is among the compounds responsible for eviscerating the nation’s bee populations."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 507, ""end"": 572, ""text"": ""but which the agency itself considers “very highly toxic” to bees"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1143, ""end"": 1340, ""text"": ""At a time when honeybees and other pollinators are dying in greater numbers than ever before, EPA’s decision to remove restrictions on yet another bee-killing pesticide is nothing short of reckless"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1788, ""end"": 1941, ""text"": ""Some of the losses have been associated with events such as massive wildfires in the west, the wet winter in the Midwest and hurricanes in the Southeast."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1942, ""end"": 2301, ""text"": ""ut the bee losses documented over the past decade are often blamed in no small part on the increased use of fungicides, herbicides and certain pesticides.

"Commercial honeybee colonies have had a rough run. And it’s not over yet. The annual loss rate for honeybees during the year ending in April rose to 40.7 percent, up slightly over the annual average of 38.7 percent, according to the Bee Informed Partnership, a nonprofit group associated with the University of Maryland. More troubling was this past winter’s losses of 37.7 percent. Winter bees tend to live longer, clustering in the hive to keep the queen warm. This winter’s losses were 8.9 percentage points higher than the survey average and the highest winter loss since the annual bee survey began 13 years ago. Karen Rennich, the partnership’s executive director, said the nonprofit has been collecting loss data from beekeepers and conducting a longer survey of management data since 2010. “We’re trying to drill down and see which management practices are correlated with lower mortality,” she said. Rennich points to the three months of California wildfires, with bees affected by smoke and by the lack of plants on which to forage. She also cited the wet winter in the Midwest and the spring’s slow planting schedule. But drought, fires, hurricanes and the Midwest’s “bomb cyclone"" are just the start of bee woes. The honeybee crisis of the past decade is often blamed on increased use of fungicides, herbicides such as Monsanto’s Roundup and pesticides called neonicotinoids. In addition to colony collapse disorder, in recent years bees have suffered from viruses carried by varroa mites, as well as problems with queen vigor, weakened immune systems and poor nutrition. Longtime beekeepers such as David Hackenberg say the bee life span has fallen to just 25 to 30 days. It used to be more than twice that. When people think of bees, they think of honey. But since the early 1990s, many beekeepers have made the majority of their money renting out their hives to farmers to pollinate crops such as apples, cranberries, melons and squash. (Row crops such as corn, wheat and soybeans are wind-pollinated or self-pollinating.) Hackenberg winters his bees in Trilby, Fla., then he starts his year by pollinating California almonds. (It takes nearly 2 million hives to pollinate California’s almond crop alone, with nearly half the country’s hired-gun pollinator bees trucked in from all over.) After that he heads to Georgia to pollinate peaches, then to Pennsylvania, then to Maine for blueberries and New York for clover honey, before finishing up by pollinating pumpkins back in Pennsylvania. He trucks his bees 80,000 to 100,000 miles each year, moving them up to 22 times. Hackenberg coined the term “colony collapse disorder” in 2006. “In 2017 we had 1,671 hives and our losses for the year were 1,458 hives. Last year we had 1,832 hives and lost 2,093 hives,” Hackenberg said this week by phone. And while losing more than 100 percent seems like a mathematical impossibility, he explained: “All we’re doing is making replacement bees to make up for our losses. I’ve been talking to the big guys across the country who had 20,000 hives and they didn’t have 1,000 hives to go to [California’s] almonds. It’s not nice to say, but the almond farmers were renting a lot of empty boxes.” Our tax dollars have subsidized beekeepers’ losses. The 2014 farm bill earmarked $20 million for the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, known as ELAP, to compensate for losses of livestock, honeybees and farmed fish. That number was bumped up to $34 million in April 2018 to deal with the year’s large number of natural disasters. “When they established ELAP numbers in 2007 or 2008, they paid out for anything over 17 percent losses, which was fairly normal in the early 2000s,” Hackenberg recalled. “We might have gotten paid 60 cents on the dollar. A year ago, they changed it because they were paying out so much money — they jumped it from 17 to 23 percent losses. Beekeepers are living off our equity.” Hackenberg is convinced that pesticide, herbicide and fungicide use is the culprit — and there is a lot more fungicide sprayed in a really wet spring — while Rennich said there may be other contributing factors, such as “monocropping,” the growing of a single crop on the same plot year after year, which reduces forage for bees, and the movement of hired-pollinator bees risking the spread of disease. Dennis vanEngelsdorp, a professor of entomology at the University of Maryland and chief scientist for the Bee Informed Partnership, said that while extreme weather has worsened honeybees’ plight, the biggest threat is varroa mites. It has been hard to develop a chemical compound that will kill the mites without killing the bees. “There have been products that work, some at 95 percent,"" he said. ""But varroa mites are increasingly resistant, and we’re trying to understand that a little better. They are acting differently than they have in the past.” Management practices can extend the health and life of bees, but vanEngelsdorp said vigilance is essential. “That’s the message we’re trying to get across,"" he said. ""People can get their mite population down to zero, and then they stop monitoring. This requires constant monitoring.” Jim Doan’s bees winter in Florida and spend the rest of the year in New York. Last year he moved his 1,200 hives to the western part of New York’s Allegany County, an area he says is away from high-intensity agriculture. “This is dairy country, and dairy has taken a downward spiral,"" Doan said by phone. “And because we’ve seen a lot of rain, nobody has gotten their corn or soy in the ground, so nobody has sprayed. I think it’s about getting bees to a pesticide-free environment.” “This past year, [bee] mortality was around 70 percent, which is about average for where we’ve been,” he said. ""It’s not where I’d like to see it, but it’s better than where it’s been.”"	547	"[{""start"": 909, ""end"": 1042, ""text"": ""ennich points to the three months of California wildfires, with bees affected by smoke and by the lack of plants on which to forage."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1043, ""end"": 1127, ""text"": ""She also cited the wet winter in the Midwest and the spring’s slow planting schedule"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1129, ""end"": 1223, ""text"": ""But drought, fires, hurricanes and the Midwest’s “bomb cyclone\"" are just the start of bee woes"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1225, ""end"": 1387, ""text"": ""The honeybee crisis of the past decade is often blamed on increased use of fungicides, herbicides such as Monsanto’s Roundup and pesticides called neonicotinoids."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1388, ""end"": 1582, ""text"": ""In addition to colony collapse disorder, in recent years bees have suffered from viruses carried by varroa mites, as well as problems with queen vigor, weakened immune systems and poor nutrition"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3951, ""end"": 4352, ""text"": ""Hackenberg is convinced that pesticide, herbicide and fungicide use is the culprit — and there is a lot more fungicide sprayed in a really wet spring — while Rennich said there may be other contributing factors, such as “monocropping,” the growing of a single crop on the same plot year after year, which reduces forage for bees, and the movement of hired-pollinator bees risking the spread of disease"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4486, ""end"": 4584, ""text"": ""said that while extreme weather has worsened honeybees’ plight, the biggest threat is varroa mite"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4586, ""end"": 4683, ""text"": ""It has been hard to develop a chemical compound that will kill the mites without killing the bees"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5075, ""end"": 5192, ""text"": ""eople can get their mite population down to zero, and then they stop monitoring.

On a recent sunny spring morning, Jay Evans, wearing a bee jacket and veil, stuck his hands into a series of hives, collected several hundred honeybees and brought them back to his laboratory where they would later be tested to determine their resistance to parasites, pathogens and pesticides. It was a normal day for Evans, a 48-year old U.S. Department of Agriculture research entomologist, and one of the nation’s leading scientists focused on identifying the causes of a prolonged die-off of the nation’s honeybees. “We have seen a mysterious decline in bees. We know there are multiple things that are hurting the bees, and we are focusing on those that are particularly fatal or risky,” said Evans. “It is worrisome and I wish we had a better answer.” In an annual survey by a consortium of universities and research laboratories, thousands of beekeepers reported losing an average of 42.1 percent of their colonies in the 12-month period that ended in April. Beekeepers once expected to lose about 10 percent of their bees in an average year, but deaths began to increase about a decade ago and have been on the rise. The recent numbers represent a disturbing trend for commercial beekeepers, and have enormous implications for farmers who count on the bees to pollinate a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops. The issue has attracted the attention of President Obama, who on May 19 announced a national strategy to promote the health of honeybees. In his work at the Agricultural Research Service Bee Research Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, Evans routinely places bees in incubators to create mini-colonies, and exposes them to bacteria, fungi, viruses, mites and pesticides to test their responses. He also introduces different nutrients, since poor nutrition has been linked to the collapse of bee colonies. The experiments vary, with the bees exposed to one or sometimes two harmful agents at the same time. Evans and his USDA colleagues are seeking to pinpoint the causes of the large-scale bee deaths through their experiments, and they are studying the genetic makeup of the bees that survive. By identifying the DNA markers of the bees that remain healthy, Evans said the hope is to breed bees that are resistant to the forces that are now causing so many of them to die. “There are so many new horizons that have been opened up by genetics,” said Evans. “And there are always new ways of looking at the beehives and bee health.” Evans was an early proponent of mapping and studying the genome of honeybees, and also has been working on sequencing the genome of the Varroa mite in order to develop novel control methods for this pest, which is harmful to honeybees. Evans and his USDA colleagues also have found that two pathogens that cause honeybee ailments are more common than previously thought and infect honeybees in places as diverse as Brazil and Maryland, prompting the need for further research. Evans said bees are not in danger of extinction because after a colony dies, beekeepers split their surviving colonies and start new ones, and the numbers rise again. But he said commercial beekeepers are struggling, and he emphasized that it is important to bring stability to the industry and ensure an adequate supply of bees for pollination and honey production. Dennis vanEngelsdorp, a research scientist at the University of Maryland and the former chief apiarist for Pennsylvania, said Evans’ work is “authoritative and respected.” “He is certainly among the top molecular bee biologists in the world, and has broken new ground on the bee genome and bee genetics,” said vanEngelsdorp. “His research has had a real impact on practical beekeeping.” Daniel Weaver, a commercial beekeeper in Texas, said Evans has been “a pioneer in explaining how honeybees respond to bacteria, microorganisms and viral pathogens.” He said Evans has provided important scientific information and assistance to the commercial beekeeping community. Evans said he loves working with bees, and has come to understand their social order and rhythms. There are times, he said, when the bees are “gentle and in a good mood,” and other times when they are “having a bad day, are grumpy and come out blazing.” He said he is determined to keep searching for answers to the crisis facing honeybees, but noted that solving this problem will take many different approaches. “The best science these days is not done in isolation, but in teams of people who add their own backgrounds and skills,” said Evans. “A major challenge is in making those teams click, and bees can teach us something about that.” This article was jointly prepared by the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, a group seeking to enhance the performance of the federal government, and washingtonpost.com.

With the help of 20 years’ worth of research and thousands of prehistoric shards of pottery, a large group of scientists have presented evidence that the deep relationship between humans and honeybees is far older than we thought — giving us just one more reason to care about the conservation of a species that we’ve relied on for thousands of years. Honeybees are a cornerstone of modern agriculture, valued both for their importance as pollinators and for the honey and wax they produce. Today, they’re considered a largely domesticated organism, commonly kept by humans in managed hives — but it wasn’t always this way. Like all domesticated creatures, honeybees  started out as wild animals. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, a group of researchers find that the relationship between humans and honeybees goes back all the way to the Neolithic age, starting around 8,000 years ago. They figured this out by analyzing residue found in Neolithic pottery from Europe, the Middle East and North Africa to see if beeswax was present. Finding beeswax residue in pottery suggests that humans were exploiting bees to use their wax (and probably their honey, too). The paper includes pottery analyses from two decades of archaeological studies, said Melanie Roffet-Salque, a postdoctoral researcher specializing in archaeological chemistry at the University of Bristol and the paper’s lead author. These many years of research were largely led by Richard Evershed, a professor of biogeochemistry at the University of Bristol. The purpose of the research varied over the decades — sometimes the scientists would be focusing on finding other types of residues, such as milk — but they would always document any other substances they found on a potsherd, including beeswax. Eventually, they decided to take a look at all the accumulated years of beeswax evidence and see what kind of insights could be gleaned. “Sometimes in papers we would report one single evidence for beeswax in a site, which is fine — but then we thought it would be fine to collate everything together and just write a paper,” Roffet-Salque said. The researchers found beeswax in Neolithic pottery throughout Europe, in the Near East and in a small corner of North Africa. The oldest evidence comes from Anatolia, or Asia Minor, dating back to the seventh millennium BC. There was also abundant evidence in the Balkan peninsula, in parts of Central and Western Europe and in the corner of North Africa now occupied by Algeria. The pottery in question ranged from the seventh millennium to the third millennium BC. The indication that humans and honeybees have been associated for so long is not particularly surprising, said Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture and social insects at Simon Fraser University, who was not involved with the paper. But, he added, “it does demonstrate the close relationship that humans have had with honeybees for many thousands of years and suggests that the current crisis of honeybees is one that we should take very seriously, because it interferes with that close symbiotic relationship.” The honeybee has been a subject of concern for decades, now, thanks to mysterious widespread die-offs, the causes of which scientists are only beginning to understand. While disease and parasites have likely played a major role in the decline of the honeybee, human influence — including habitat destruction and pesticide use — are also thought to have been major contributors. But because of bees’ profound importance to modern agriculture, the public has largely rallied around efforts to preserve the species, and the White House even released a National Strategy to Preserve the Health of Honeybees and Other Pollinators earlier this year. Now, learning more about how long and pervasive the history of human reliance on the honeybee has been could provide even greater motivation for people to make sure that relationship continues to last. The paper also provides insight into the honeybee’s historic range, which has been poorly understood until now. “Honeybees have been quite invisible throughout the archaeological record because they’re so tiny and disappear very quickly,” Roffet-Salque said. But the pottery evidence shows clearly where honeybees existed during the Neolithic age — and it also provides some evidence as to where they didn’t. The researchers failed to find any beeswax in areas of Europe above the 57th parallel, which would include Scotland, parts of northern Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Because bee exploitation seemed to exist in other parts of Europe during the same time period, the most logical explanation is that bees simply didn’t occupy these northern areas. These results suggest that the 57th parallel represented “the natural ecological limit for bees at the time,” Roffet-Salque said. Since modern-day honeybees can now be found in areas above that line, this evidence suggests that bees have adjusted their historic range over the last 10,000 years, likely in response to climatic changes. “This information could prove very useful in understanding how climate change will affect populations of honey bees,” said Gene Robinson, director of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology and the Illinois Bee Research Facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in an e-mail to The Post. (Robinson also was not involved with the paper). “We already know that warming temperatures are shrinking the ranges of closely related bumble bee species in Europe and North America.” But Winston says these results are not particularly surprising, either. “As climate changes, we should expect organisms like bees to increase in some places and decrease in others,” he said. But being aware of the potential for these climate-related changes is useful, as these shifts can have “major implications in some places for how agriculture is conducted,” he added. At the very least, the paper offers fresh insight into poorly understood aspects of the honeybee’s history and introduces a novel, albeit time-consuming, method of investigating these questions. And given the honeybee’s importance to modern agriculture and close association with human culture, the study can be considered an intriguing look back into both man and insect’s early history. According to Robinson, it’s “an exciting new European biogeographical narrative for the most beneficial insect on the planet.” Read more in Energy & Environment: This could be the biggest sign yet that the battery revolution is here Peabody Energy, the world’s largest coal company, to disclose more climate risks to investors These could be the first U.S. states to tax carbon — and give their residents a nice paycheck For more, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here, and follow us on Twitter here.	545	"[{""start"": 3282, ""end"": 3491, ""text"": ""While disease and parasites have likely played a major role in the decline of the honeybee, human influence — including habitat destruction and pesticide use — are also thought to have been major contributors."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5062, ""end"": 5373, ""text"": ""This information could prove very useful in understanding how climate change will affect populations of honey bees,” said Gene Robinson, director of the Carl R.

Two large-scale studies published Thursday suggest that common pesticides may harm bee colonies. In some cases, the pesticides contribute to the loss of not only worker bees but also queens. The studies, in the journal Science, have been eagerly anticipated because of concerns about the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, but the results were not as clear-cut as experts had hoped. The question is not whether neonicotinoids can be toxic to bees. These chemicals are marketed for their insect-killing power, and bees are, after all, insects. What has been harder to pin down is whether the exposure bees experience in the wild is harmful. Tests of neonicotinoids on bees in the lab show that the compounds are dangerous to them, but field studies have largely failed to implicate the pesticides. To resolve the controversy, two teams conducted large-scale field and lab studies designed to mimic natural conditions across four countries. Researchers in Europe placed bees in neonicotinoid-treated canola fields and monitored their health. Researchers in Canada monitored bees in apiaries within 550 yards of treated corn fields. They sampled pollen and honey for pesticides over five months and attempted to replicate that exposure under controlled conditions. Both studies showed negative but different effects on bees, and demonstrated that bees are picking up neonicotinoids from surprising sources. In the European study, three types of bees were placed in 33 different canola fields across three countries. The differences between bees in treated or untreated fields were largely insignificant, and many of the bees in both groups died before they could be counted. This demonstrates how tough large-scale field studies are to conduct, said Richard Pywell, one of the study authors. Of the differences that were statistically significant, results varied by country. In Hungary, honeybee egg production decreased and fewer worker bees survived the winter. In Britain, honeybee worker numbers decreased, and so did drones for a certain species of wild bee. In Germany, drone numbers for that same wild bee species and honeybee egg production actually increased. Several important factors might help explain these regional differences. Nearly half the pollen picked up by bees in Hungary and Britain came from canola. In Germany, that number is closer to 10 percent. That means German bees had a wider variety of flowers to choose from, possibly diluting their exposure to pesticides. Disease rates were also lower in Germany. In Britain, many of the bees fell prey to the dreaded Varroa destructor mite — a hairy, fanged parasite that many bee experts blame for the majority of losses that occur in commercial honeybee operations. In Hungary, a fungal infestation devastated the bees in the study. That bees in Britain and Hungary, but not Germany, were adversely affected by neonicotinoid exposure suggests that the pesticides may exacerbate deadlier pressures bees face, such as parasites. However, the small number of significant effects “makes it difficult to draw any reliable conclusions,” said Norman Carreck, science director of the International Bee Research Association, who was not part of either study. Christopher Cutler, who studies insect toxicology at Nova Scotia's Dalhousie University, echoed Carreck’s concerns, pointing out that “when many different analyses are conducted” (42 in this case), “a small number of statistically significant effects are bound to emerge by chance.” In another complication, when the researchers in Europe sampled the nests of bumble bees and solitary bees for pesticide residues, they found contamination with one type of neonicotinoid not used in the study. This was surprising, because there is a moratorium on the use of the pesticides to treat seeds of flowering plants in the European Union. This supports previously proposed hypotheses that neonicotinoids, which are water soluble, might persist in the soil, and that the bees were picking up chemicals applied before the ban. In the Canadian study, scientists found that bees were exposed to 26 different pesticides. Neonicotinoids were present far below dangerous levels, but the exposure continued for months. Surprisingly, the bulk of contaminated pollen didn’t come from crops treated with the pesticide but from wildflowers nearby. That adds to the evidence that neonicotinoids might move through the soil and get picked up by other plants. Researchers fed the bees “pollen patties” laced with neonicotinoids at levels reflective of what they measured in the field. Bees’ health suffered in several ways. Worker bees exposed as larva died younger, and treated colonies were more likely to be without a queen. Queen loss is normal during midsummer, but the exposed colonies were much less likely to rear a replacement queen. Neonicotinoids also interfered with a behavior known as “social immunity.” Usually, bees remove their dead compatriots from the hive, but bee corpses stuck around longer in exposed colonies. Finally, neonicotinoids, when mixed with a certain fungicide, were more toxic than either alone. Cutler, who was not part of either study, called these results “interesting” and “useful” but regretted that the researchers did not collect any “colony-level data,” such as fertility, honey production or winter survival rates, which might better reflect the resiliency of bee colonies. Bee exposure to neonicotinoids has been a puzzle. The pesticides are chemically similar to nicotine, which evolved in plants as a natural defense against insect predators. Neonicotinoids are commonly used to treat seeds or soil before planting. They move through the plant providing allover defense throughout development. They are popular with farmers because they don’t have to be sprayed throughout the season. Theoretically, that should mean less exposure for bees than to a sprayed pesticide. In practice, recent concerns have focused on the capacity for neonicotinoids to be kicked up in dust clouds during planting. Canada has mandated the use of agents that help keep neonicotinoids out of the air. The new studies suggesting that neonicotinoids seem to persist in the soil may help explain how bees, which do not forage on wind-pollinated corn, could still be exposed near fields of treated corn seeds. In terms of how neonicotinoids effect bees in the field, many questions remain. How far is far enough for a wildflower to be from a treated field without taking up neonicotinoids? And as Pywell wonders, “If the bees are healthier, will they be more resilient to stresses such as neonicotinoids?” Together, the two research groups looked at a handful of bee species. What of the 20,000 others that inhabit the planet? And perhaps the most difficult question, what should we do about it? An approach popular with activists would be to ban neonicotinoids altogether, but many experts worry this would cause farmers to turn to older and potentially more harmful methods of pest control. “Things are better for honey bees since neonics replaced more harmful insecticides,” said beekeeper and science blogger Randy Oliver. Since the E.U. moratorium went into effect in 2014, farmers in England have struggled with increased pest pressure, Carreck said. Many have turned to pyrethroid pesticides, which have unknown consequences on bees and other beneficial insects. Pywell emphasized that if the E.U. continues the moratorium, we need to investigate what alternative pesticides are doing to bees. I asked Dave Walton, a family farmer in Iowa, what he would do if neonicotinoids were banned. “We would have to use other products. … Lorsban comes to mind.” Lorsban is a brand name for an equally controversial organophosphate insecticide, part of a class that is far more toxic to humans than neonicotinoids. They are also not more bee-friendly. Amro Zayed, who was involved with the Canadian study, recommends restricting the use of insecticides until after a pest problem occurs, instead of preemptively applying them to every seed we plant. Oliver agreed. “Neonics are still vastly overused as risk management, rather than as needed treatments for actual pest control,” he said. When I asked Walton whether this was a workable compromise, he seemed less optimistic. “We use it to combat insects that feed on the seed and seedlings,” he explained. “By the time we find the insects, the damage is already done.” The buzzword in farming these days is what’s known as “integrative pest management.” In IPM systems, conventional pesticides are used responsibly, and pest control relies heavily on natural predators. One potential strategy Pywell discussed is limiting exposure by supplying other flowers near fields that could also serve as a refuge for pest predators. Walton explained that they employ a similar strategy on his farm, planting wildflowers and other native plants in ditches and field margins. However, given the evidence that neonicotinoids are more mobile and persistent than previously imagined, it may be important to monitor whether flowers in refuges are picking up neonicotinoids. Wildflower refuges could also address an even greater threat to bees — habitat loss. Endless rows of wind-pollinated corn leave bees of all types scrambling for food. Likewise, urban sprawl and grassy lawns make for homeless, hungry pollinators. Many bee experts emphasize the importance of considering how changes to all landscapes could help or harm the pollinators we depend on.	544	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 95, ""text"": ""arge-scale studies published Thursday suggest that common pesticides may harm bee colonie"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 97, ""end"": 189, ""text"": ""In some cases, the pesticides contribute to the loss of not only worker bees but also queen"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 191, ""end"": 397, ""text"": ""The studies, in the journal Science, have been eagerly anticipated because of concerns about the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, but the results were not as clear-cut as experts had hoped"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 191, ""end"": 397, ""text"": ""The studies, in the journal Science, have been eagerly anticipated because of concerns about the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, but the results were not as clear-cut as experts had hoped"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1278, ""end"": 1418, ""text"": ""Both studies showed negative but different effects on bees, and demonstrated that bees are picking up neonicotinoids from surprising sources"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2546, ""end"": 2750, ""text"": ""n Britain, many of the bees fell prey to the dreaded Varroa destructor mite — a hairy, fanged parasite that many bee experts blame for the majority of losses that occur in commercial honeybee operations."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2751, ""end"": 2816, ""text"": ""In Hungary, a fungal infestation devastated the bees in the study"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2818, ""end"": 3011, ""text"": ""That bees in Britain and Hungary, but not Germany, were adversely affected by neonicotinoid exposure suggests that the pesticides may exacerbate deadlier pressures bees face, such as parasites."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3518, ""end"": 4050, ""text"": ""In another complication, when the researchers in Europe sampled the nests of bumble bees and solitary bees for pesticide residues, they found contamination with one type of neonicotinoid not used in the study.

Honeybees are important for more than just making honey. They also pollinate a lot of our crops — one-third of them, in fact. But a common narrative emerging these days is that the bees are dying. Beekeepers have reported losing substantial fractions of their colonies each winter over the past decade or so. In other cases, piles of dead honeybees have turned up. Environmental and other public-interest groups often cite pesticides as a leading culprit. In particular, they want regulators to ban a specific group of pesticides known as “neonicotinoids.” Activists argue that these pesticides not only kill honeybees, but may be behind the different, more mysterious set of symptoms known as colony collapse disorder (CCD). This week, 125 public-interest groups asked the Environmental Protection Agency to consider pulling these pesticides from the market. How responsible are pesticides for the plight of honeybees? We don’t have much clear-cut evidence. But that lack of evidence shouldn’t offer us comfort. Here’s why. Neonicotinoids’ bee impacts, in a nutshell Neonicotinoids are a relatively new form of pesticide designed to target aphids, termites and other pests. What makes them unique is that they’re systemic — the plant itself actually absorbs the pesticide into its leaves and tissues. That helps farmers because they don’t need to repeatedly spray their crops with the chemicals. But the pesticide also ends up in pollen and nectar, which honeybees consume. Laboratory studies have shown that the neonicotinoids can kill bees. And in recent years, some research has shown that some neonicotinoids have subtler, “sublethal” impacts on bees, harming their flying or food-foraging abilities. And still more research has found that neonicotinoids could induce at least some of the symptoms of CCD, although these findings have proved to be controversial. In CCD, adult worker bees abandon a colony, but the queen bee and immature bees remain; few dead bees, if any, are found outside the hive. Case closed? There are a few reasons why it’s more complicated than it seems. First, pesticides’ effects on individual bees don’t necessarily equate to the effects on a colony. Thousands of bees live together, collectively functioning as a super-organism. And this super-organism can still keep functioning even if some of its members get sick or die. Additionally, bees in nature are exposed to dozens of other pesticides and other hazards such as habitat destruction and parasites, all of which may work together to hurt them. It’s also worth noting that bee deaths aren’t a one-size-fits-all proposition; not all of beekeepers’ recent colony losses are caused by CCD. Piles of dead bees are sometimes confused with CCD as well. What we don’t know Given those factors, would banning neonicotinoids cut losses of bee colonies? Not all scientists are convinced. And we still don’t have much evidence that neonicotinoids themselves are linked specifically to CCD. Here’s why that’s no reason to rest easy: We may lack evidence right now. But that dearth of evidence could stem from gaps in the scientific methods that regulators rely on. To go on the market here or in Europe, pesticides must pass tests called “risk assessments” to show that they wouldn’t be unacceptably toxic to humans or wildlife. Among the creatures for which regulators study pesticides’ risks are honeybees. The problem: Traditional lab tests on bees told us only how much pesticide it takes to kill them, while ignoring impacts on behavior, flight or foraging abilities. The tests also didn’t necessarily tell us what would happen at the colony level, in the long term, or with multiple pesticides at a time. The Environmental Protection Agency and the European Food Safety Authority have been working to address these problems. They’re trying to improve bee risk assessments by adding a round of field studies; these would be performed in the event that laboratory tests raise any red flags. These field studies, although cumbersome and expensive, could tell regulators how real-world doses of pesticides affect whole colonies. Regulators also want to use new laboratory tests to identify other red flags — such as longer-term/”chronic” effects and sublethal effects — that would trigger these field tests. But many of these tests aren’t ready for use just yet. To bee, or not to bee banned? What do we do about the neonicotinoids, then? It boils down to how cautious we want to be. The European Union decided it wasn’t going to take any chances, so it banned neonicotinoids for two years, saying not only that the pesticides can kill bees but that they may carry other risks we aren’t aware of yet. But in the United States, the burden is on regulators to show that a pesticide is unacceptably risky before they can ban it. And in many cases, regulators here can give pesticides an early stamp of approval if some risk data is missing. This practice of “conditions registrations” has proved controversial, including for the neonicotinoid pesticide “clothianidin.” In short, there are a lot of potential ingredients that could be driving honeybee deaths. But we still don’t know exactly what this lethal recipe is, especially in the case of CCD and winter colony losses. If pesticides — and neonicotinoids, specifically — are involved, however, they may not be acting alone. And it’s unclear whether barring them would save the bees. But the scientific gaps we see here illustrate an important fact: Absence of evidence doesn’t always mean evidence of absence.	543	"[{""start"": 365, ""end"": 455, ""text"": ""Environmental and other public-interest groups often cite pesticides as a leading culprit."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 557, ""end"": 725, ""text"": ""ctivists argue that these pesticides not only kill honeybees, but may be behind the different, more mysterious set of symptoms known as colony collapse disorder (CCD)."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1475, ""end"": 1543, ""text"": ""Laboratory studies have shown that the neonicotinoids can kill bees."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1544, ""end"": 1705, ""text"": ""And in recent years, some research has shown that some neonicotinoids have subtler, “sublethal” impacts on bees, harming their flying or food-foraging abilities."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1706, ""end"": 1867, ""text"": ""nd still more research has found that neonicotinoids could induce at least some of the symptoms of CCD, although these findings have proved to be controversial."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1706, ""end"": 1867, ""text"": ""And still more research has found that neonicotinoids could induce at least some of the symptoms of CCD, although these findings have proved to be controversial."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 4465, ""end"": 4680, ""text"": ""he European Union decided it wasn’t going to take any chances, so it banned neonicotinoids for two years, saying not only that the pesticides can kill bees but that they may carry other risks we aren’t aware of yet"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5047, ""end"": 5136, ""text"": ""n short, there are a lot of potential ingredients that could be driving honeybee deaths."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5047, ""end"": 5136, ""text"": ""n short, there are a lot of potential ingredients that could be driving honeybee deaths."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	522	2023-04-11T10:50:02.705642Z	2023-04-11T10:50:02.705745Z	511.888
CORVALLIS, Ore. — On a recent summer morning in a bright green meadow off a winding country road, Devon and Landon Prescott were prying open beehives. They moved quickly among the 1,400 wooden boxes, eyeing each brood and locating its queen. Landon, 19, spoke up after finding four hives with missing queens. “That’s pretty bad,” said Devon, 21, peering over his brother’s shoulder to search the bee-covered screen. A hive without a queen is likely doomed. “That’s really high.” There was a crate of replacement queens in the truck, each housed in its own tiny wooden box. Each queen, specially ordered and shipped from warm-weather climates, costs at least $20. Too many queenless hives could put young beekeepers like the Prescotts out of business. Over the past decade, billions of bees have been lost to colony collapse disorder, an umbrella term for factors thought to be killing honeybees in droves and threatening the nation’s food supply. Amid the die-off, beekeepers have been going to extraordinary lengths to save both their bees and their livelihoods. That effort may finally be paying off. New data from the Agriculture Department show the number of managed honeybee colonies is on the rise, climbing to 2.7 million nationally in 2014, the highest in 20 years. Bees are still dying at unacceptable rates, especially in Florida, Oklahoma and several states bordering the Great Lakes, according to the Bee Informed Partnership, a research collaborative supported by the USDA. Last month, Ohio State University’s Honey Bee Update noted that losses among the state’s beekeepers over the past winter were as high as 80 percent. Oregon has taken less of a hit. Researchers say innovative beekeepers will be critical to helping bees bounce back. “People ask me, ‘The bees are going to be extinct soon?’ ” said Ramesh Sagili, principal investigator at the Oregon State University Honey Bee Lab. “I’m not worried about bees being extinct here. I’m worried about beekeepers being extinct.” Beekeeping in America was already a graying industry when the rigors of colony collapse began to take their toll. A new generation of backyard beekeepers and urban hobbyists — worried about the fate of bees — has sprung up in the face of the disorder, said Tim Tucker, a Kansas beekeeper who serves as president of the American Beekeeping Federation. But “what’s not increasing are the commercial levels of beekeepers,” said Tucker, who estimates that the number of professionals on his membership list has plummeted by half since the mid-1990s. That makes Devon Prescott something of an anomaly among the nation’s estimated 2,200 commercial pollinators: a young man. He networks with other beekeepers on Facebook and Instagram, and sees his work as an essential part of a global cause. “I feel a social responsibility to provide good bees,” Prescott said. “It makes me happy to look at the part that I’m playing.” Still, Prescott, who trucks bees from the almond fields of California to the cherry orchards of the Columbia River Gorge, worries about the economics of the business. He said he has lost track of the number of hives that have turned up dead or queenless since he started keeping bees four years ago. Each dead hive equals a loss of as much as $200. Back in his truck, Prescott shook his head. “Why are they so hard to keep alive?” He looked across the cab at his brother. “What do you think, Landy?” “I don’t know why it’s so hard. They’ve been around so long,” Landon said. “Why would we need to help them so much?” Obsessing over bee health was unheard of 50 years ago, said Marla Spivak, a University of Minnesota professor of entomology. “In the past, it was very easy to keep bees. Throw them in a box, and they make honey and survive. Now, it takes lots of management.” Researchers think a variety of factors are responsible for colony collapse: Monocultural farming practices, diseases and pesticides are suspected. Also, the tiny varroa mite, which sucks bee blood and leaves open wounds. The mite arrived in the United States in the late 1980s and “has changed the face of beekeeping,” Sagili said. Bee death was not new to beekeepers. In their 2012 working paper, “Colony Collapse Disorder: The Market Response to Disaster,” agricultural economists Randal Rucker and Walter Thurman write that seasonal die-offs have always occurred, with beekeepers losing 14 percent of their colonies, on average, each winter. But since colony collapse was first documented in 2006, the annual die-offs have been far more dramatic, forcing beekeepers to use increasingly creative techniques to keep their bees alive. One common tactic: restocking queenless hives with fresh, new queens. Another: splitting a healthy hive in two and starting a second hive with a new queen. Beekeepers can also turn to packaged bees, which cost about $55 for 12,000 workers and a fertilized queen. “Beekeepers know what to do,” Rucker said in an interview. After 2006, “they adjusted and they adjusted quickly.” Research suggests that beekeepers are being at least partially compensated for that effort with higher honey prices and higher pollination fees. For California almonds, which require the pollination help of 1.6 million hives per year, beekeepers earn roughly $175 per hive. Other crops pay significantly less, however. For example, blueberries, cherries and pears pay around $40 per hive in Oregon. Then there are the long seasons and constant travel. In Oregon, commercial beekeepers work from January to October, pollinating not only crops of fruits and vegetables but also the multibillion-dollar Willamette Valley seed and wine industries. And beekeepers who avoid big colony-collapse losses face other potential disasters. In late June, a truck filled with hives tipped in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, sending the load tumbling off the highway. Hundreds of thousands of bees perished. “It is hard, and it costs a lot of money,” said George Hansen, past president of the ABF and a beekeeper in Oregon for 35 years. “There’s a certain toll you have to pay for when things go wrong. . . . How many times can you take those kinds of hits and still get up and do it again?” Henry Storch, 32, does it because he felt a calling to beekeeping. A farrier by trade, Storch said he could make more money shoeing horses. But five years ago, he became obsessed with the notion that he could build a better bee. “I put some out in the middle of nowhere, and the bees were doing really good,” Storch said, popping open a hive with his bare hands. He barely flinched as a bee stung him on the upper lip. Storch’s mountain-bred “survivor” bees are like open-range cows: tough, hardened and less in need of close management than the bees he trucks to the California almond fields. Storch compares the effort to growing organic, non-GMO food. “I’m trying to create something with a certain set of traits that’s more resilient, that provides a solution to world problems,” he said. Storch keeps his costs low, using his arms instead of a forklift to load each 60-pound wooden hive onto his 20-year-old truck. With low costs, he can experiment. Rumbling through the Oregon wilderness, for example, he noticed a profusion of invasive plant species. He wondered: Can I make honey from that? “If you’re worried about having non-native species here, you’ll just get bummed out,” he said. “With the bees, it’s potential.” In the wildlands of Oregon’s Coast Range, Storch found that his survivor bees thrived on invasive plants. He began bottling the result, selling jars of honey produced from weird, rarely seen varietals such as big-leaf maple, blackberry and lotus — even poison oak. The idea has resonated among Portland’s foodies. One Portland cafe, Sweedeedee, uses Storch’s Old Blue Raw Honey in all of its baked goods; a local food critic declared the salted honey pie “divine.” Another high-end bistro hosted a $50-per-plate, four-course “honey brunch” featuring Storch’s honey in everything from honey-cured bacon to honey “drinking porridge.” While Storch depends on almonds to stay in business, he always keeps some survivor bees in the mountains to make their “really rad honey.” “Bee breeding has gotten really skewed toward almonds,” he said. “That’s part of why I’m doing my own thing.” Earlier this year, Storch separated five breeder queens from his survivor colonies and gave them away to beekeepers in California. Storch hopes the bees, bred deep in Oregon’s thickly forested bear country, might just be a first step toward saving bees around the world.

Nestled in the hills of Glen Echo Heights, among the towering oaks and poplars, a lot that is smaller than half an acre is buzzing with about 180,000 honeybees. The bees share the lot with Chris White, Tamara Zemlo and their three children — the humans live in a midcentury house, the bees in three hives of their own. Working together, the bees and their caregivers produced about 140 pounds of honey last year. Most of that honey, minus what the bees need to survive the winter, is bottled and sold under the company name Bee America. One of the four types of honey Bee America sells through their Web site is called Tulip Poplar, for the tall native trees that are common in this part of Maryland and whose yellow flowers provide nectar for honeybees in the spring. Ten flowers yield about one drop of nectar. It takes about 10 drops of nectar to make one drop of honey, so it takes about 1 million bee visits to make a pound of honey. Bee America is a small, family-owned business that combines two hot trends — beekeeping and locavorism. Beekeeping has taken off in recent years, and White and Zemlo — scientists by training — are part of a growing group of people with day jobs who have decided to keep bees in their back yards. You want to do something with an impact, said White, who — besides working at the National Institute of Standards and Technology — is also a fire department volunteer. “You can’t really save the whales,” he said, “but the honeybees are in trouble.” Lots of trouble, it turns out. In 2006, beekeepers began reporting that 30 to 90 percent of their hives were dying, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. A list of possible suspects emerged: the non-native Varroa mite; pesticides and herbicides; fungi; warmer winters because of global warming. No obvious answer has emerged, but one thing is clear: Apis mellifera is under assault. In other words, it’s a tough time to be a bee. That’s where independent beekeepers come in. The USDA recommends that the public come to the aid of honeybees by planting nectar-rich plants and using pesticides more judiciously. Others take it further by creating homes for bees. And they not only create the hives, but also check on them, clean them and, when necessary, rid them of mites and other predators. George “Bee George” Meyer, president of the Montgomery County Beekeepers Association, said beekeeping has become increasingly popular. The association has about 200 members, Meyer said. Each year, the 80-slot beekeeping class fills up. Meyer, whose 100 hives are in Takoma Park and Trappe, produced about 5,000 pounds of honey last year. He sells the honey under the name “Bee George Honey” at local farmers markets and co-ops. “Bees are in trouble, and people are concerned,” Meyer said. He has watched as beekeeping has become downright trendy. Over the years, he said, it has moved from the domain of farmers into a suburban pastime. Now, urban beekeeping is the latest thing. “Chefs are putting hives on their roofs,” he said. In the past few years, blogs have been created, nonprofits have started and books have been written on the subject of urban and suburban beekeeping. Novices can turn to the nonprofit conservation organization Honey Love for advice or register at the Beesource Beekeeping Web site, which boasts an online community of more than 14,000 registered members. Dozens of books have been published on the subject, from “Beekeeping for Dummies” to “The Urban Beekeeper: A Year of Bees in the City.” But it’s not just bees who need us; we need bees. Honeybees are not native to the United States. They were brought over from Europe by early settlers and have become integral to the way we produce food. Without bees, we simply could not get the large fruit, nut and vegetable yields our modern food system depends on, according to the USDA. For example, around this time of year, more than 1 million beehives are loaded into trucks for a cross-country trek to California, where they are let loose among flowering almond trees to pollinate them. Then, they are loaded up again, and the process is repeated all over the country with other crops, such as apples, berries, cantaloupes and cucumbers, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. All told, bees pollinate more than $15 billion worth of crops a year. But Meyer, White and Zemlo don’t just want to help the bees; they’re also in it for the amber nectar. For “locavores,” who prefer to eat locally grown products, honey is the ultimate food. In fact, any honeybees you see in Montgomery County “belong” to a hive in someone’s yard, as there no longer are any feral bees, Meyer said. And just as wine lovers speak of “terroir,” so do honey makers talk about the sweetness of orange blossom honey from the South or the earthiness of tulip poplar honey. It’s a message White and Zemlo hope to bring to the public. Zemlo has quit her job to focus on marketing “Bee America” full time. Next up are trade shows, farmers markets and local shops. As for their Glen Echo Heights neighbors, White and Zemlo said they haven’t heard any complaints about their flying friends. Eloise Keary, who lives next door, said she watches from her deck as White, in his beekeeping outfit, tends the bees, but she remains unafraid. “I think it’s beautiful,” Keary said. “Just lovely.” Unlike wasps, which can sting multiple times, White said, honeybees can only sting once before they die, so they are less likely to do so. “Bees have work to do — they’re not interested in you,” White said. “They’ve been doing this for thousands of years. Our job is to get out of the way.”	541	"[{""start"": 1658, ""end"": 1798, ""text"": ""A list of possible suspects emerged: the non-native Varroa mite; pesticides and herbicides; fungi; warmer winters because of global warming."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	520	2023-04-11T10:29:40.232472Z	2023-04-11T10:29:40.232569Z	531.015
Around the world, the animals that pollinate our food crops — over 20,000 species of bees, butterflies, bats and many others — are the subject of growing attention. An increasing number of pollinator species are thought to be in decline, threatened by a variety of mostly human pressures, and their struggles could pose significant risks for global food security and public health. Until now, most assessments of pollinator health have been conducted on a regional basis, focusing on certain countries or parts of the world. But this week, a United Nations organization has released the first-ever global assessment of pollinators, highlighting their importance for worldwide food and nutrition, describing the threats they currently face and outlining strategies to protect them. The report, which was released Friday by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), has been in the works since the summer of 2014. The research team consisted of more than 70 experts, who drew on the most up-to-date global pollinator science, as well as local and indigenous knowledge, to complete the assessment. The report includes four overarching findings, said Simon Potts, deputy director of the Center for Agri-Environmental Research at Reading University, during a Friday press briefing. First, there are well-documented declines in pollinators, both wild and managed, throughout the world. Second, these pollinators provide society with a wide range of benefits. Third, they are threatened by a variety of factors. And fourth — and most importantly — there are still opportunities to protect them. The importance of pollinators   The health of pollinator populations is intrinsically tied up with global food security, the IPBES assessment notes. Altogether, nearly 90 percent of all flowering plants on Earth depend on animal pollination, and that includes about 75 percent of the world’s food crops. Keeping agricultural production high enough to feed the world’s ballooning human populations will depend in a big way on the insects and other animals that help them reproduce. The assessment reports that in the past 50 years alone, the volume of agricultural production that depends on animal pollination has increased by about 300 percent. “Our nutritional security is intimately linked to pollinators, with many of our vitamins derived from pollinated crops,” Potts said. “So there is this kind of link between pollinators, crops and human diets and ultimately health.” Some of the most widely enjoyed crops that heavily depend on animal pollination include apples, cocoa beans, coffee and almonds. And pollinators’ importance to agriculture means there’s a big economic factor to consider there as well. “The global market value linked to pollinators is huge,” Potts noted. The assessment finds that anywhere from $235 billion to $577 billion worth of global food production every year relies on animal pollination. Additionally, many pollinator species have immense social and cultural value, Vera Imperatriz-Fonseca, co-chair of the assessment and an ecology professor at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said at the briefing. She pointed out that many are “a source of inspiration for all of us in art, music, literature, religion and technology.” So there are clear reasons to care about the fate of the world’s pollinators. The problem is that in many places, they aren’t doing so well. Using data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, the IPBES assessment points out that more than 16 percent of vertebrate pollinators on Earth — that’s mainly bats and birds — are threatened with extinction. Insects are a little harder to assess because there tends to be less global data about them. But regional studies have shown widespread declines throughout many parts of the world, especially among bees and butterflies. “Using internationally accepted IUCN assessment criteria, there are some national red lists for bees which often have more than 40 percent of the species listed as threatened,” Potts said. He also added that there’s been only one continental assessment conducted, which studied bees and butterflies in Europe and found that 9 percent were threatened. Even this number is likely an underestimate, he added, given that approximately half the bee species on the continent could not be assessed due to a lack of data. The declines are a concern for both wild pollinators and managed ones, which are kept by humans, the researchers are careful to note. Honeybees are the most common managed pollinators. And while overall the number of honeybee hives throughout the world has doubled in the last 50 years, certain regions — most notably Europe and North America — have experienced significant declines as a result of colony collapse disorder. What’s threatening the pollinators — and how can we help them?     According to the assessment, there are a wide variety of factors affecting pollinators throughout the world, and it would be difficult to pinpoint one primary source of all the trouble. Habitat destruction and degradation is one important source. Some species of pollinators can visit just about any type of plant they want — but others are much more specialized, and only feed on certain species. So having a high diversity of plants in any given area is important for attracting many different types of pollinators. Developing the land and cutting down on the natural plant diversity in an area can be a big problem. Intensive agriculture, which focuses on only a few crops at a time, can be a contributor to this issue. And the use of pesticides has demonstrated harmful effects as well — an issue that’s recently come to the forefront of national attention in the United States. The Obama administration’s National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators, released by the White House last year, called for better scrutiny of the effects of pesticides on pollinating insects. And last month, the Environmental Protection Agency released the first in a series of preliminary risk assessments of insecticides thought to be harmful to bees. The U.N.’s assessment notes that the effects of pesticides depend on the type of chemical being used, the amount in which it’s applied and the type of pollinator that’s been exposed. However, the assessment does report that research has found a variety of lethal and nonlethal (but still negative) consequences of pesticide exposure in insect pollinators, mainly bees. During Friday’s press briefing, the authors were quick to clarify that the report is not meant to be taken as a blanket condemnation of pesticide use. “We don’t provide recommendations,” Potts said. “Just really high-quality evidence based on what the available data says.” Other factors thought to be affecting pollinators include disease and the influence of invasive species, which can compete with native species for resources. And climate change is becoming a growing concern, as well. Many species have already been affected by the changing climate, said Jeremy Kerr, a biology professor at the University of Ottawa, who was not an author on the new assessment. Last year, Kerr was the lead author on a study published in Science which found that bumblebees in both North America and Europe have been shifting their ranges in response to climate change. This kind of reaction is a concern because there’s a possibility that, over time, pollinators could shift their ranges out of reach of the plants they usually pollinate. And this is just one effect we’ll likely continue to see in the future. “One of the other things that’s certainly an issue here in terms of individual species and the direct effect of climate on species … is the timing they have, or the phenology of these species — when they come out, when they do the things that they do,” Kerr said. Climate change can cause some species to emerge at different times of the year than they used to, for instance, or reproduce at different times. These kinds of changes could disrupt their seasonal interactions with the plants they pollinate. With so many factors threatening the world’s pollinators, the looming question is whether anything can be done to save them. According to the new assessment, there are actually a lot of opportunities on this front. Protecting natural areas and diversifying the landscape are obvious steps. The assessment suggests restoring native vegetation, planting flower corridors and trying to keep natural areas connected to one another as much as possible. “Hospitable landscapes are ones where there are suitable nesting habitats for diverse pollinator species, and where consistent forage resources are accessible (within the flight range) of the bees throughout their flight seasons,” Neal Williams, an entomologist at the University of California Davis (who was also not an author on the new assessment), said by email. The assessment also recommends more diverse and sustainable forms of agriculture — for example, utilizing organic farming practices, conducting crop rotations and allowing diverse communities of plants to grow alongside traditional farmland in order to attract and maintain pollinator populations. More in-depth research will be necessary for a better understanding of the specific effects of individual pesticides, and governments may also consider coming up with strategies to reduce their pesticide use and develop more diverse pest management techniques, the assessment suggests. And taking steps to minimize the introduction of invasive species, combat the spread of disease among pollinators and mitigate climate change are all crucial, as well. The biggest takeaway is that there are a huge variety of threats facing the world’s pollinators, and so proportional action must be taken to address each of them as soon as possible. “The question for us as a society really, not just a science community, is can we walk and chew gum at the same time in terms of dealing with conservation solutions,” said Kerr. “Are we really only capable of doing one thing at a time, or can we manage habitats better than we do now, can we control our pesticide use so we’re just a little more careful than we are now?”   The answer remains to be seen, and will likely depend on the coordinated actions of individual governments. But there’s much to be optimistic about, according to the assessment’s authors. The report was agreed upon by the more than 100 countries belonging to IPBES, which demonstrates an international concern for the issue, they pointed out at Friday’s briefing. The role of IPBES, and its report, is to strengthen the dialogue between the scientific community and policymakers, said IPBES chair Zakri Abdul Hamid. “We wanted the government to be moved to take action, and that’s what it’s all about,” he said.

Just last year, it seemed there was something to celebrate despite planet Earth’s ongoing honeybee apocalypse: Bee colony losses were down. Not by enough, but they were down. “It’s better news than it could have been,” said Dennis vanEngelsdorp, a University of Maryland entomology professor who led a survey of bee populations that reported a loss of 23 percent of bee colonies — less than 30 percent, the average from 2005 to 2013. “It’s not good news.” Though scientists cited progress in battles against an Asian mite that has killed many an American bee, they had words of caution. “One year does not make a trend,” Jeff Pettis, a co-author of the survey who heads the federal government’s bee research laboratory in Beltsville, Md., told the New York Times. Turns out Pettis was right. VanEngelsdorp and other researchers at the Bee Informed Partnership, affiliated with the Department of Agriculture, just announced more than 40 percent of honeybee hives died this past year, as the Associated Press reported. The number is preliminary, but is the second-highest annual loss recorded to date. “What we’re seeing with this bee problem is just a loud signal that there’s some bad things happening with our agro-ecosystems,” study co-author Keith Delaplane of the University of Georgia told the AP. “We just happen to notice it with the honeybee because they are so easy to count.” The cause of the bees’ demise was not noted, but researchers said colony collapse disorder — which causes mass deaths of the bees for reasons not fully understood — was not necessarily the culprit. As the Times put it last year: “What has emerged is a complex set of pressures on managed and wild bee populations that includes disease, a parasite known as the varroa mite, pesticides, extreme weather and poor nutrition tied to a loss of forage plants.” “The winter loss numbers are more hopeful especially combined with the fact that we have not seen much sign of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) for several years, but such high colony losses in the summer and year-round remain very troubling,” Pettis said in a statement. He likened summer deaths to having “a higher rate of flu deaths in the summer than winter.” “If beekeepers are going to meet the growing demand for pollination services, researchers need to find better answers to the host of stresses that lead to both winter and summer colony losses,” he said. VanEngelsdorp called the situation “unheard of.” “We traditionally thought of winter losses as a more important indicator of health, because surviving the cold winter months is a crucial test for any bee colony,” vanEngelsdorp said. “But we now know that summer loss rates are significant too. This is especially so for commercial beekeepers, who are now losing more colonies in the summertime compared to the winter.” The state worst affected was Oklahoma, which lost more than 60 percent of its hives. Hawaii escaped relatively unscathed, losing less than 14 percent. “Most of the major commercial beekeepers get a dark panicked look in their eyes when they discuss these losses and what it means to their businesses,” said Pennsylvania State University entomology professor Diana Cox-Foster, who didn’t participate in the survey. Her state lost more than 60 percent of its colonies. The USDA estimated that honeybees add more than $15 billion to the value of the country’s crops per year. “If losses continue at the 33 percent level, it could threaten the economic viability of the bee pollination industry,” the department said. “Honey bees would not disappear entirely, but the cost of honey bee pollination services would rise, and those increased costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers through higher food costs. Now is the time for research into the cause and treatment of CCD before CCD becomes an agricultural crisis.” The survey included almost 400,000 colonies — more than 15 percent of the nation’s total. A researcher at Bayer, who makes pesticides linked to colony collapse disorder, said the losses were “not unusual.” Indeed, though losses are up, so were the total number of bee colonies. But since beekeepers split surviving hives to repopulate, stressing bees out, VanEngelsdorp said an increasing number of hives “doesn’t mean bee health is improving or stable,” as the AP put it.	539	"[{""start"": 456, ""end"": 585, ""text"": ""Though scientists cited progress in battles against an Asian mite that has killed many an American bee, they had words of caution"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1101, ""end"": 1226, ""text"": ""What we’re seeing with this bee problem is just a loud signal that there’s some bad things happening with our agro-ecosystems"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4122, ""end"": 4199, ""text"": ""But since beekeepers split surviving hives to repopulate, stressing bees out,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4122, ""end"": 4198, ""text"": ""But since beekeepers split surviving hives to repopulate, stressing bees out"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1841, ""end"": 1980, ""text"": ""he winter loss numbers are more hopeful especially combined with the fact that we have not seen much sign of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1841, ""end"": 1980, ""text"": ""he winter loss numbers are more hopeful especially combined with the fact that we have not seen much sign of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	518	2023-04-11T10:06:56.679697Z	2023-04-11T10:06:56.679820Z	401.752
At social gatherings, when folks learn that Joseph Wilson is an expert on bees, they sometimes parade their knowledge of these insects: Bees live in large colonies with their mother queen, they make great stores of honey and if they sting, the stinger stays attached to your skin. This is all true for the honeybee, but not for the 4,000 other species of bee found in the United States and Canada. “They don’t live in big hives, they don’t make honey and they can sting you multiple times,” Wilson said. “All those things they thought applied to bees are an anomaly.” Honeybees have been husbanded for centuries, valued for their honey, their wax, their ability as supreme pollinators to make an apple orchard all the more fruitful. Their struggle with colony collapse disorder in recent years has captured the popular imagination. As someone who has kept bees, I can say that honeybees are an enchanting, if somewhat needy, form of livestock. The one thing they are not: “a poster child for other bees,” said Wilson, a biology professor at Utah State University. The colony losses of the honeybee — linked to pesticide use, parasitic mites and other factors — have broadened a sense of our reliance on pollinators in general. Most of us know the large, black and pesky carpenter bee that gnaws into our decks in May or the sweet bumblebee that seems oblivious to its own stem-bending heft. But what of the small iridescent green bead that is the euglossa bee, or the golden Svastra, stocky, woolly and like a miniature teddy bear with wings. Yes, bees can sting, but they are generally much more placid than such waspish creatures as yellowjackets and bald-faced hornets, and certainly more agreeable outdoor companions than biting flies. And yet many people can’t distinguish a wasp from a fly or bee, never mind among bee species. For people who enjoy and observe the natural world — gardeners, for example — that confusion can seem as odd as calling a cat a dog. So as folks become more interested in bees, it seemed logical to Wilson and fellow bee biologist Olivia Messinger Carril that people should be more informed as well. The result is their new guide, “The Bees in Your Backyard,” which offers an introduction to a world of bees that is mostly hidden to people who aren’t entomologists. Honeybees can be managed in hives because in nature they congregate in tree cavities, but 70 percent of wild bees nest in the ground, often as solitary insects or as a congregation of loners: Think of an apartment building full of singles. Maybe as many as a third of bees evolved to feed off a given flower or flower family. The others are generalists and will devour whatever nectar and pollen is around. The largest bee in North America is a species of carpenter bee, whose hulking frame smothers most of a quarter. The smallest is a gnat-size species named Perdita minima — on the same quarter, it would just about cover George Washington’s nose. Here’s another honeybee-vs.-wild-bee quirk: For all the colony losses experienced by beekeepers, they can (with work, skill and expense) repopulate lost honeybee hives. The species isn’t imperiled. Wild bee losses may be more troubling: According to the 2014 book “Bumble Bees of North America,” as many as half of the 46 species covered may be in decline. For many other bee species, their status is murky even to scientists, Carril and Wilson told me, because there is so little historical record of their past presence and abundance. “Nevada, for example,” Wilson said. “It’s probably a very diverse area, but it’s had very little bee research done on it.” So if we are making gardening resolutions in the new year, it might be good to promise ourselves to do more for these lesser-known bees and to pay more attention to them. We can attract them the same way we enrich our gardens for other pollinators and ourselves: with an extravagant floriferous garden that blooms abundantly from March to November. We should make sure that we steer clear of pesticides that can harm bees, and buy only plants that haven’t been treated with systemic neonicotinoids. Carril pointed out that the showiest double-flowered blooms offer reduced levels of nectar and pollen. One of the easiest and most bee-friendly plants is the annual sunflower. Perennial versions are also long-blooming and are high-performing garden plants for summer and fall. Look for varieties of Helianthus angustifolius and H. giganteus. Asters are also great for bees, along with goldenrods. There are many varieties to consider during the current garden-planning period some people call winter. You can build nesting boxes for bumblebees (not always successful) or simple wooden blocks drilled with holes for cavity-dwelling bees. Most usefully, keep a dry corner of your yard free of lawn, thick mulch or ground cloth. A dry-laid stone wall offers perfect nesting spaces. Asked which native bee he likes the most, Wilson said he is captivated by the 600 or so tiny species in the Perdita genus. “They’re small, so that’s interesting, but most are specialists in terms of which plants they visit.” Carril, who lives in Santa Fe but received her doctorate from Southern Illinois University, said she likes the few species of Exomalopsis that have moved north of the Mexican border. With their black-and-white-banded abdomens, they are handsome and archetypal. Her other special bee is the Diadasia, about two dozen species of medium-to-large bees that evolved to feed from mallow blooms but then adapted to also feed from cactus flowers. Her PhD thesis had to do with why they added a second source. Her research involved removing the antenna of a euthanized bee and placing it between gas electrodes to identify the floral compounds that attracted the bee. The experiment, she conceded, “sounds bad for a lover of bees. I promised myself that later I would make a large cactus garden.” More from Home and Garden: An amaryllis is the gardening gift of the holidays. Here’s how to keep it alive.

If there’s any animal that can’t seem to catch a break, it’s the honeybee. Thanks to what scientists believe is a combination of disease, parasites, pesticides and other environmental stressors, honeybee colonies have experienced significant losses over the past decade or so — a phenomenon that’s troubling to say the least, given the insect’s immense importance when it comes to pollinating food crops and other plants. But despite recent efforts to increase protections for the honeybee, new surveys suggest that the insect is still suffering — perhaps now more than ever. A survey released this week by the Bee Informed Partnership, a collaborative organization of honeybee researchers around the country, revealed that beekeepers in the United States lost 44 percent of their colonies in the past year — the second highest annual loss reported in the past 10 years. Colony “losses” refer to colonies whose bees died from any number of possible reasons, such as disease. They do not necessarily refer to hives stricken by colony collapse disorder, which is a well-publicized but very specific phenomenon that occurs when a colony’s worker bees suddenly and mysteriously abandon the nest. Notably, the survey indicated that bee losses during the summer were just as high as bee losses during the winter — an alarming finding, considering summer is the time of year when bees should be at their healthiest. “The summer is boom time for bees — lots of forage,” said Dennis VanEngelsdorp, the survey’s project director and an entomologist at the University of Maryland. “We usually think of this as a very good time for bees. When we first started this [survey] 10 years ago, we didn’t even monitor summer losses because we didn’t think this would be significant.”   Altogether, the study surveyed more than 5,700 beekeepers managing nearly 400,000 honeybee colonies across the country. The findings indicated that about 28 percent of managed colonies were lost during both the 2015 summer and the 2015-2016 winter. Because beekeepers tend to add, remove or restore colonies throughout the year, these numbers come out to about a 44 percent loss of all colonies managed between April 2015 and March 2016. A second survey, published Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, supports these dire findings. Those results suggested that beekeeping operations throughout the country, maintaining five or more colonies at a time, lost anywhere from 12 to 18 percent of their colonies each quarter between January 2015 and April 2016. Scientists say they think the losses stem from a variety of factors, some of which may be more prevalent than others. “What we think from other surveys is there are three major drivers,” VanEngelsdorp said. “Pesticides, poor nutrition and, most importantly, parasites.”   In fact, VanEngelsdorp was involved with another recent study, published last month in the journal Apidologie, which surveyed bee parasites and diseases between 2009 and 2014 and provided some insight into what afflictions are the biggest problems for honeybees. The survey found that Nosema, a disease-causing fungus, and the Varroa mite, a parasite capable of carrying a variety of harmful viruses, both remain major problems among honeybee colonies. In particular, the study indicated that Varroa mites may be more prevalent than previous analyses have suggested, with their infestations peaking between August and November. “Especially in the fall, over 50 percent of the colonies sampled had levels higher than we think [will] damage colonies,” VanEngelsdorp said. He noted that backyard beekeepers, in particular, who typically keep fewer than 50 colonies at a time, sometimes fail to treat their hives for mites — and this can contribute to the parasite’s spread. “When those colonies die, they spread their mites to all the neighborhood bees,” he said. He added that the mite’s role in commercial beekeeping operations — which are larger and typically stay on top of their parasite treatments — seems to be “a little more complicated,” and is more likely to combine with other factors that may contribute to the demise of colonies, including the effects of pesticides or poor nutrition.   At the end of the day, scientists generally believe that no single factor is causing the demise of honeybees in the United States — and recent efforts to help the insects recover reflect this view. Last year, for instance, the White House released its first National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators, a document that stressed the importance of increased research on the effects of pesticides and establishing larger areas of good-quality habitat for pollinators, such as bee and butterfly gardens in urban areas. The strategy set a goal of bringing winter honeybee colony losses down to 15 percent within the next 10 years — although, as this week’s surveys suggest, summer losses are now deserving of equal, if not greater, attention. In the coming weeks, the Bee Informed Partnership will continue to break down the results of the most recent survey in order to analyze whether any particular regions or types of beekeeping operations seem to be more affected than others and to examine the causes of death most suspected by beekeepers. Gaining a greater understanding of these kinds of trends is a matter of immense importance to agriculture, and therefore national food security, VanEngelsdorp said. “One in every three bites we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by bees,” he said. “Without honeybees we would not be able to produce apples and almonds and a lot of other berries and fruits, so it’s really important to understand the drivers of these losses.”	537	"[{""start"": 75, ""end"": 275, ""text"": ""hanks to what scientists believe is a combination of disease, parasites, pesticides and other environmental stressors, honeybee colonies have experienced significant losses over the past decade or so"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2743, ""end"": 2802, ""text"": ""Pesticides, poor nutrition and, most importantly, parasites"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3070, ""end"": 3259, ""text"": ""The survey found that Nosema, a disease-causing fungus, and the Varroa mite, a parasite capable of carrying a variety of harmful viruses, both remain major problems among honeybee colonies."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4147, ""end"": 4200, ""text"": ""including the effects of pesticides or poor nutrition"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4204, ""end"": 4400, ""text"": ""At the end of the day, scientists generally believe that no single factor is causing the demise of honeybees in the United States — and recent efforts to help the insects recover reflect this view"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4204, ""end"": 4400, ""text"": ""At the end of the day, scientists generally believe that no single factor is causing the demise of honeybees in the United States — and recent efforts to help the insects recover reflect this view"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 4402, ""end"": 4629, ""text"": ""Last year, for instance, the White House released its first National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators, a document that stressed the importance of increased research on the effects of pesticides"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4402, ""end"": 4629, ""text"": ""ast year, for instance, the White House released its first National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators, a document that stressed the importance of increased research on the effects of pesticides"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	516	2023-04-11T09:52:26.638323Z	2023-04-11T09:52:26.638414Z	1834.018
