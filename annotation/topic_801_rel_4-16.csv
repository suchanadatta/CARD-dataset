“I always use this chart of childhood death,” Bill Gates says. “In 1960, 25% of kids died before the age of 5. And now we’re down below 6% of kids dying before the age of 5.” We’re sitting in a bare conference room at his foundation’s D.C. headquarters. Gates -- who Bloomberg News calculates is once again the world's richest man -- is in town to talk to members of Congress about his top priority this year: Global health – and, in particular, the total eradication of polio. He wants to drive that 6 percent even lower, and he believes he can. Wiping out a disease like polio sounds impossible. But it’s actually, Gates tells me, completely achievable. Perhaps even by the end of 2013. This is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Ezra Klein: Your Foundation is known for taking a particularly data-driven approach to its work. So how do you know what’s actually working when you’re in failed states with very little data-collection capacity? Bill Gates: Of all the statistics in health, death is the easiest, because you can go out and ask people, “Hey, have you had any children who died, did your siblings have any children who died?” People don’t forget that. If you say to them, “Did your kids get vaccines or not,” they might have done it and not remember, or they might think, “Oh, this person wants me to say yes, maybe I look bad if I don’t say yes.” Death is something we really understand extremely well. But you can save a lot of lives. One thing about the childhood death rate is you really can split it into the first 30 days of life versus 30 days to 5 years. Thirty days to 5 years is all vaccine preventable stuff -- it’s diarrhea, respiratory and malaria. The first 30 days, the primary healthcare system really has to engage with the mother pre-birth, and then get the mother to do things like keeping the baby warm, making sure to avoid doing things that break the baby’s skin, breast-feeding, and that’s been harder. We’ve had sites in India where we can cut those deaths down by over 50 percent just by training the mother. But the worker has to engage with the patient, hopefully speak the same language or be of the same caste so that they’re willing to trust the advice that they’re getting. EK: What’s been the biggest surprise? What has the data shown works, or doesn’t work, that you simply didn’t expect? BG: I was completely surprised that nobody was funding some of these vaccines. When I first looked at this I thought, well, all the good stuff will have been done. It was mind-blowing me to find things like Rotavirus vaccine were going unfunded. One hundred percent of rich kids were getting it and no poor kids were. So over a quarter million kids a year were dying of Rotavirus-caused diarrhea. You could save those lives for $800 per life. That's like $20 or $30 per year of life. It's just ridiculous that an intervention like that isn't funded. And I’m really surprised at the variance. Some very poor countries run great vaccination systems and some richer ones run terrible programs. The north of Nigeria has about 30 percent vaccination coverage, and they’re above average in terms of wealth within Africa. You compare that to, say, Somalia, which has absolutely no government at all, and they get about 60 percent vaccine coverage of children. So you have a place literally with no government getting a better vaccine coverage than a place that’s above average wealth. EK: Why? BG: Well, in Somalia they’ve given up using the government. The money goes through the NGOs. Whereas in Nigeria they’ve designed a system where the federal government buys the vaccines, the state government provides the electricity, and the one level down below that provides the salaries. It’s just a bad design. You know, the north of India has very poor vaccination rates, so we picked a state up there with 80 million people and we drove it from 30 percent to 80 percent. But they had a really good chief health minister and the federal government was providing lots of money and lots of good technocrats, so the skills were there, as long as you employed them in the right kind of system. EK: This gets into an interesting question about public health, which is that when we think about health-care challenges, we think primarily about technological challenges. We think about cures for cancer and vaccines for AIDs. But in public health, much of the challenge is logistical and organizational -- how you deliver, how you organize, who you actually partner with. And that seems much harder to replicate. If you can invent the pill, then you can probably keep reproducing the pill, but even if you get a good system in the north of India with their good health minister, it isn’t necessarily the case that you can move that over to the south of Nigeria.  BG: It can be replicated, though. Ethiopia is a good example of a country that decided to get serious, train 35,000 health workers and actually put them in the right places. So they did the map, looked at it, got the donor money, it’s a work in progress. It’s doing quite well but there are still a few of the supply chain things that need to be fixed. So, it can be replicated. We do report cards for each country, saying OK, did you have a plan, do you have the money, did you do the personnel right, did you do the supply chain right? EK: What’s the difference between trying to work in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries? BG: The low-income, middle-income and high-income health systems have extremely different problems. You know, in low-income countries, getting to a health post is hard. It’s very expensive. Whereas in rich countries, yes, you can get to your doctor. In low-income countries, the main problems you have is infectious diseases. We’re dealing with countries that in the worst case where kids have death rates of 20 percent and that’s all infectious disease. And nothing else. In the U.S., in terms of kids under 5, other than premature birth, you really don’t have big problems. Kids just don’t die of infectious disease. Then as you get into the adult phase, in the U.S., what do people die of? From age 5 till age 50, you’ve got suicide, you’ve got traffic accidents. There’s very little cancer and heart disease before age 50. Then once you get past your 50s, the poor countries basically say, “Hey, I hope you don’t get cancer, because if you do get cancer, we just don’t have enough money per person, we’re just not gonna buy chemotherapy drugs. We’re just not going to get engaged in that.” EK: How do you make these decisions about what is and isn’t worth paying for? BG: The way that this is talked about is, what’s a year of life worth? They call it a disability-adjusted life year (DALY). When you're running a poor country health-care system, you can’t treat a year of life as being worth more than, say, $200, $300 or else you’ll bankrupt your health system immediately. So, with very few exceptions, you do nothing for cancer. If you get cancer, you're going to die. And so none of the stuff that’s going on in the U.S. about $300,000 a year chemotherapy drugs is relevant. Even simple things don’t pass the test. We’re on the verge of saying that Africa should do blood pressure medicine because it’s become generic and so cheap and that’s such a common issue in terms of heart attack death, the so-called polypill is so cheap that it’s one of the few non-infectious disease things that meets the dollars per DALY threshold to actually go into a poor healthcare system and say this is worth it given the extremely finite not only financial resources, but personnel resources, that you have. But here’s the good news for these countries. If you spend the less than 2 percent of what the rich countries spend, but you spend it on vaccinations and antibiotics, you get over half of all that healthcare does to extend life. So you spend 2 percent and you get 50 percent. If you spend another 80 percent you're at over 90 percent. EK: Your top priority, I’m told, for the next year is the literal eradication of polio. What’s between here and there? BG: Whenever you can eradicate one of these infectious disease, you get these exponential benefits. Polio’s the extreme example where we’re near the magic number of zero, so the $2 billion that the year spends protecting kids against getting polio, the day you know you're at zero -- you have to really know you’re there -- then you save the $2 billion. And, you know, that happened for smallpox. Nobody spends any money on smallpox unless they worry about a bio-terrorist recreating it. It’s financially the best thing that ever happened because we're saving all that money forever after. So in 1988, the World Health Organization, through the World Health Assembly, declares they’re going to eradicate polio. It's already been eradicated in North America and South America and most of Europe. Polio is paralyzing 360,000 kids a year when they start. They get it down below 10,000 by the year 2000. Then from 2000-2010 it stays flat. And they lose credibility because they're always saying “Oh, just give us two more years,” and they're just doing the same thing and it's not working. And so in 2010, the polio community got together and said, “Look, are we going to succeed or not?” And so there were a lot of improvements made, those led to finally getting done in India in 2011. And India was expected to be the hardest and the last. EK: Just a point of clarification, the functional mechanism here is a high enough level of vaccine coverage, right? When we say eradicate, we mean got it to a high enough level of vaccine coverage that the disease died out? BG: Yeah, eradicate means there's no poliovirus around. The method of doing that is you get to extremely high levels of vaccination --  that is, over 90 percent of the kids have the drops three times, and that protects them and the disease dies out. The number is actually well below 90 percent if you're in a community that either has good sanitation or where the kids don't move around much. EK: So what did we learn that made eradication possible in India? BG: The two things that were done super well were social mobilization and mapping where the houses were. When somebody would refuse to take the vaccine, they would mark it down and they would have either a political leader or religious leader come in and convince them. Dealing with refusals is a huge part of this. If your team goes in, maybe they don't speak the dialect, they're not the same caste, the family has heard a rumor that the vaccine is bad, there's many reasons you get refusals, and so you need follow-up for refusals. Usually you'll get 10 to 20 percent refusals. But if there's been a rumor, you get much higher refusals. EK: A rumor that, say, the vaccine is bad, or it makes you sick? BG: Yeah or that the U.S. government uses vaccination campaigns to sterilize Muslim women. Vaccination always has problems with rumors. The U.S. doesn't achieve nearly as high a vaccination rate as many countries. Vietnam is 99 percent vaccination, the U.S. is about 95 percent. Because people just hear “Oh, what about autism or something.” But it's particularly bad in poor countries. EK: The logistics of the operation seem basically impossible. How do you ensure you hit every tiny village in a mountainous, rural, poor country? BG: We began using satellite maps and we're finding particularly in Nigeria we were missing a lot of settlements, a lot of nomadic people. The thing we were missing the most was a village would be on a border, and one government would say, “Oh, that's on their side,” and the other guy would say, “No, that's on their side.” So your chance of getting polio was super elevated if you happened to live on the border between these local government administrative boundaries. Then in terms of the teams doing their job, we now put a phone with a GPS sensor in it, every three minutes it says where this team is. It's in the box with the vaccine so when they come in at the end of the day we plug that in and see if they really went where they were supposed to go. Our biggest problems now are violence, which causes campaigns to be canceled, or people just not to be willing to go into various neighborhoods, and refusals having to do with bad rumors about the vaccine campaign. And these are both serious issues in both Pakistan and Nigeria. Afghanistan is just part of the Pakistan thing, and it's not the big deal. The number of cases there is pretty small and it's just in the areas where there's fighting. EK: I almost feel bad asking it after this particular discussion, but what has this work made you think about our health-care system's problems, recognizing everything you said about how incredibly, incredibly different they are from, truly poor countries? BG: It's an important topic and I do care about it. My deep interest in this came somewhat because it's fascinating but also because our big cause in the U.S. is education, and if you look at state budgets, they are moving money from education to health. They have to because the health costs are just exploding. So very quickly say to yourself, gosh, if there's going to be any money left for university education and adequate money for K-12, even to stay flat, you have to figure out health-care costs. Unfortunately, in rich-world health, innovation is both your friend and your enemy. Innovation is inventing organ replacement, joint replacement. We're inventing ways of doing new things that cost $300,000 and take people in their 70s and, on average, give them an extra, say, two or three years of life. And then you have to say, given finite resources, should we fire two or three teachers to do this operation? And with chemotherapies, we’ve got things where we’ll spend our dollars on treatments where you’re valuing a life here at over $10 to $20 million. Really big, big numbers, which if you were infinitely rich, of course that would be fine. So most innovations, unfortunately, actually increase the net costs of the healthcare system. There's a few, particularly having to do with chronic diseases, that are an exception. If you could cure Alzheimer's, if you could avoid diabetes -- those are gigantic in terms of saving money. But the incentive regime doesn’t favor them. EK: You’ve talked a lot so far about this question of DALYs. We’re very uncomfortable putting a value on human life. The way I see our health system is we’ve chosen to pay a huge premium in order to avoid these questions. A prerequisite for the kind of cost-cutting innovations you’re talking about it is being willing to make judgments about what a human life is worth, or even what a few months of a human life are worth. Because if you can't decide that, then of course you just pay for everything. But if you start trying to make those choices, or even get people to think about those choices, people cry “death panels!” BG. Yes, someone in the society has to deal with the reality that there are finite resources and we're making trade-offs, and be explicit about that. When the car companies were found to have a memo that actually said, “This safety feature costs X and saved Y lives,” the very existence of that memo was considered damning. It was “Oh, you think human life is only a bank account.” Or when you made it reimbursable for a doctor to ask, “Do you want heroic care at the end-of-life,” that was a death panel. No, it wasn't a death panel! It was asking somebody to make a decision.	120	"[{""start"": 3056, ""end"": 3179, ""text"": ""The north of Nigeria has about 30 percent vaccination coverage, and they’re above average in terms of wealth within Africa."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 12131, ""end"": 12409, ""text"": ""Our biggest problems now are violence, which causes campaigns to be canceled, or people just not to be willing to go into various neighborhoods, and refusals having to do with bad rumors about the vaccine campaign.

| From staff reports and news services LAGOS, Nigeria — Nigeria has reported its first two cases of polio in more than two years, in an area newly liberated from Islamist extremists who had attacked polio vaccinators in the past, the government and the World Health Organization said Thursday. Nigeria’s removal from the WHO’s list of polio-endemic countries in October had meant the entire African continent was free of the crippling disease. Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the WHO, said in an email that “finding children paralyzed by polio shows that surveillance is working, even in areas of the country affected by insecurity, but it is a sobering reminder that countries need to remain vigilant and immunize children until the virus is completely eradicated worldwide.” Two children have been paralyzed by polio in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno state in two local government areas that had been cut off by Boko Haram’s Islamist militants, Health Minister Isaac Adewole said in a statement Thursday night. Adewole ordered the deployment of a national emergency response team. The WHO said it was working with the government to urgently use large-scale immunizations and other measures to prevent more children from being infected. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement Thursday saying that “this is not the first time that polio eradication efforts have experienced a setback. It is a reminder that we must redouble efforts to strengthen surveillance and immunization activities. We remain 100 percent committed to eradicating polio.” It was unclear how accessible the two areas in Nigeria are. The United Nations last month suspended aid to newly liberated but still dangerous areas of Borno after Boko Haram ambushed a humanitarian convoy, wounding three civilians, including a ­UNICEF worker. The suspension came even as aid groups declared that half a million people are starving in those areas and ­children are dying daily of starvation. Because of the Islamist uprising in the country’s northeast, health workers have been testing sewage and stool samples of refugees from areas too dangerous to access. Nigeria’s fight against polio has been dramatic. Two decades ago, it was recording 1,000 polio cases a year, the highest in the world. The Islamist extremists opposed the anti-polio campaign. Boko Haram gunmen killed nine female vaccinators in ­northern Kano state in February 2013, but the vaccinations continued.	119	"[{""start"": 56, ""end"": 129, ""text"": ""Nigeria has reported its first two cases of polio in more than two years,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 778, ""end"": 1011, ""text"": ""Two children have been paralyzed by polio in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno state in two local government areas that had been cut off by Boko Haram’s Islamist militants, Health Minister Isaac Adewole said in a statement Thursday night."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2285, ""end"": 2463, ""text"": ""The Islamist extremists opposed the anti-polio campaign.

The World Health Organization will mount an aggressive vaccination campaign in five African countries after two children were paralyzed by wild polio virus in Nigeria, the first such outbreak there in two years, officials said Friday. Michel Zaffran, who directs the WHO’s efforts to eradicate the disease, said a six-round campaign of vaccinations for children younger than 5 would begin shortly in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno state and quickly expand to Chad, Cameroon, Niger and the Central African Republic in coming weeks. The effort is “a major response to what we consider a major threat to the polio eradication initiative,” Zaffran said in a telebriefing for reporters. Because polio paralyzes between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000 children who are infected, the virus is probably circulating much more widely than the two cases would seem to indicate, said Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and public health at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “It is the tip of the proverbial iceberg,” he said. The Associated Press reported Friday that military helicopters had rushed polio vaccine to parts of Nigeria’s northeast, where the militant group Boko Haram operates. A state health official told the news agency that the two affected children were among refugees who recently arrived from areas just freed from the control of the Islamic extremists. Zaffran revealed that the two patients are a boy and a girl, both younger than 2 and from different parts of Borno state. Tests showed that they were sickened by the Type 1 polio virus, one of two wild types known to remain in the world. It probably has been circulating undetected in Borno since 2011, he said. Despite intensive disease-surveillance efforts, attacks by Boko Haram have uprooted many people from villages and made tracking polio difficult. The new outbreak was a major setback for eradication of polio, which had not been detected in Nigeria since July 2014. WHO will not declare a region polio-free until there are no confirmed cases for three years, so the clock now must be reset on what had become a major advance in public health in Africa. Until the announcement Thursday, polio recently had been found only in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both of those countries have made substantial progress, raising the prospect of worldwide eradication of the wild virus. As recently as 2012, Nigeria was home to half the world’s polio cases. Type 2 polio, last seen in India in 1999, was declared eradicated last September, and Type 3 has not been seen in more than three years, Zaffran said. Some cases of polio are still caused by mutation of the weakened live virus used in vaccines, which is excreted and can be passed to other children. “It was to be expected that there was going to be some problems in the quality of surveillance, but we didn't think wild polio virus was  circulating in this area,” he said. While acknowledging a major “disappointment,” Zaffran was upbeat about the prospects of controlling the outbreak. He said he did not know the cost but noted that millions of vaccine doses are in stock and that more would be purchased for later rounds of vaccination. The campaign will supplement ongoing initiatives in the five countries of the Lake Chad basin, he said. Cooperation from governments helps health officials know when it is safe to enter sometimes risky regions to vaccinate children, he said; in other places, health workers take advantage of military efforts to clear areas of combatants. Even in the most insecure countries, such as Syria and Somalia, health officials are sometimes able to mount “hit-and-run” vaccination strikes that get them out of dangerous areas in just a few hours. Still, because the vaccine must be administered several times, the campaign will require concerted work over a number of months, he said. One of the paralyzed children tested positive for polio on July 13, Zaffran said, and the virus was then found in tests conducted on healthy people who had contact with that child. In the other young patient, who developed symptoms of paralysis July 6, the virus could not be found in a stool sample, but the disease was confirmed when a healthy child contact tested positive. Klausner, who has conducted epidemic surveillance for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the vaccination program will be large and costly but is well worth the expense to prevent the resurgence of polio. “It’s logistically very difficult, but this is something that WHO and programs [in Africa] have experience with,” he said, describing the outbreak as a temporary setback. “Over the past couple of decades, millions and millions and millions of children” have been vaccinated. Zaffran said the latest development will not thwart efforts to rid the world of polio. “We believe that polio eradication is absolutely feasible and is on track and in spite of this very  disappointing news,” he said.	118	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 233, ""text"": ""d Health Organization will mount an aggressive vaccination campaign in five African countries after two children were paralyzed by wild polio virus in Nigeria, the first such outbreak there in two years, officials said Friday"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 235, ""end"": 527, ""text"": ""Michel Zaffran, who directs the WHO’s efforts to eradicate the disease, said a six-round campaign of vaccinations for children younger than 5 would begin shortly in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno state and quickly expand to Chad, Cameroon, Niger and the Central African Republic in coming weeks"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1189, ""end"": 1371, ""text"": ""A state health official told the news agency that the two affected children were among refugees who recently arrived from areas just freed from the control of the Islamic extremists."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 680, ""end"": 968, ""text"": ""Because polio paralyzes between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000 children who are infected, the virus is probably circulating much more widely than the two cases would seem to indicate, said Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and public health at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1372, ""end"": 1683, ""text"": ""Zaffran revealed that the two patients are a boy and a girl, both younger than 2 and from different parts of Borno state.
