The Anacostia River might be small — 8.5 miles — but don’t be fooled by  its size. Its watershed, which stretches 176 miles across portions of the  District and Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, is the most developed area within the Potomac’s watershed, and arguably the most important. “The Anacostia watershed is extremely populated, developed and polluted,” said Ed Merrifield, head of the Potomac Riverkeeper group, “and because of its size, those things are highly concentrated. If you step back and look at the region’s water as a whole, the Anacostia is by far the most important chunk.” HISTORY Long before the Anacostia River was nicknamed “the forgotten river,” the Nacotchtank Indians called it “anaquash,” which means “village trading center.” Historians estimate that Native Americans lived on the river for 10,000 years. In the early 1600s, English settlers began to clear forests in the watershed to grow tobacco and use the river as a shipping channel. Gradually, toxic silt began to build on the river’s bottom. By the mid-1800s, ships had trouble making it to the port at Bladensburg. The river, no longer useful for business, was abandoned. Over the next century, the District’s population grew tenfold, reaching 800,000 in 1950, which covered 25 percent of the Anacostia watershed with impervious surfaces. Today, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that less than 10 percent of the area’s original forests and wetlands remain. But Mike Bolinder, head of the Anacostia Riverkeeper group, said that some recent developments have been welcomed by environmentalists, who hope for the birth of a green community along the riverfront. “Nationals stadium was probably the first time in history that environmentalists and developers were on the same side,” he said. “Environmentalists knew that development would bring money to clean up the area, and developers knew that in order to get permits, they had to go green.” During this year’s Earth Day cleanups, the parking lot at RFK Stadium was decorated with banners bearing the new slogan, “Rediscover your Anacostia.” “It really all comes down to people,” said Brent Bolin, the society’s director of advocacy. “You can do a hundred tests and give a hundred tours, but where there’s real estate, there’s progress.” BIGGEST ISSUES Litter: Garbage has plagued the river for decades. More than 20,000 tons of trash pollute the river each year. Location: Bolinder said the Anacostia River is surrounded by lower-income communities that have not had an opportunity to advocate for themselves. “We want to inspire people who live in these communities to take action,” he said. Stormwater runoff: The Anacostia’s issues with stormwater runoff are closely tied to the region’s population growth. “More people means more pavement,” Bolin said. “Pavement is a superhighway for runoff.” CLEANUP EFFORTS Bag tax: Authorities say the Anacostia River Cleanup and Protection Act, also known as the “bag tax,” has reduced the river’s most common form of litter by about 75 percent since it was enacted two years ago. The fees also paid for trash traps on the river. One year after the fee was enacted, the District reported reductions in the use of paper and plastic bags from 22.5 million to 3.2 million. Montgomery County adopted the fee in January. Talking trash: Trash Free Schools, a litter reduction initiative by the Alice Ferguson Foundation, teaches students about recycling programs and waste management. Of the eight schools participating in the District and Prince George’s County, six are within walking distance of the Anacostia River. Low-impact development: Julie Lawson, of the Anacostia Watershed Society, said Nationals park set the bar for low-impact development with green roofs and a runoff control system. “It manages rainfall in a very sophisticated way,” she said. WHAT YOU CAN DO Install a rain barrel. Rain barrels keep stormwater from sweeping debris and chemicals into drains, and they provide clean water for tasks such as gardening. If used regularly, they can also reduce water bills. D.C. Greenworks (www.dcgreenworks.org) offers rebates for rain barrels. Dig a rain garden. Rain gardens are designed to soak up runoff. RiverSmart Homes, a program run by the District Department of the Environment, will reimburse homeowners $1.25 for every impervious square foot treated. Details are at ddoe.dc.gov/riversmarthomes. Visit the Anacostia. The Earth Conservation Corps (202-479-4505, Ext. 101) and Bladensburg Waterfront Park (www.pgparks.com) offer boat tours of the river, and the Anacostia Watershed Society holds cleanups, paddle boating clinics and native plant walks (www.anacostiaws.org).

Just about every jurisdiction in the Washington area has seen increases in taxes or utility fees in recent years, part of an effort to fix aging roads, sewer lines and other parts of the region’s crumbling infrastructure. But repair efforts have still fallen far behind. During the next 15 years, the cost of fixing and updating basic infrastructure is expected to exceed available funding by $58 billion, according to a report by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. That means more floods in D.C. neighborhoods as corroding sewer lines and decrepit storm-water pipes give way. It means more potholes on highways and streets that are buckling under punishing weather and traffic, a problem that led to 95,000 repairs since January just in Northern Virginia. And it means more years of overcrowded schools and outdated libraries, police stations and firehouses. The funding shortfall is part of a national infrastructure spending gap that in recent years has resulted in bridge collapses and levee breaks. In a metropolitan region of 6 million people, where a sputtering regional economy has weakened government spending, local officials say the unmet need — including 176 bridges deemed “structurally deficient” — is reaching crisis proportions. “Often, people begin to see the urgency only when the power goes out, or when the water is off,” said Stephen Walz, director of environmental programs for the Council of Governments, which surveyed government officials, utilities and urban planning experts before issuing its report. “The pipes below the streets are clearly, unless they break, out of sight, out of mind.” Local officials and utility companies say they’re searching for ways to raise more money for needed upgrades and repairs. In the District, D.C. Water has doubled its rates during the past six years, to an average of $95 per year per household, to pay for nearly $4 billion in repairs and upgrades to sewer lines and storm-water pipes over the next decade. In Virginia’s Fairfax County, officials have created special tax districts for road improvements in Tysons Corner and Reston and are contemplating doing the same in other congested neighborhoods. In Maryland, Montgomery County officials recently launched a six-year, $4.5 billion capital improvement program to deal with sidewalk and gutter repairs, road maintenance, and the need to build more classrooms for a school system that has grown by 14,600 students since 2000 and this year housed 9,000 students in trailers. At the same time, officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars more to widen clogged roads, upgrade sewer systems and fix buildings, bridges and tunnels that are deteriorating. “What’s been handed to us is nobody’s fault,” said George S. Hawkins, chief executive of D.C. Water. “It is a reality of decades — maybe up to a century — of deferred maintenance.” Half of the District’s 1,800 miles of sewer lines are at least 84 years old, and half of the 1,350 miles of water pipes in the city are at least 79 years old, Hawkins said. Some storm-water mains date to the Civil War. “That’s sort of mind-boggling,” Hawkins said. He estimated that faulty pipes and mains in the nation’s capital account for between 400 and 500 water main breaks and about two dozen sewage spills every year. “Those are the events that can cut drinking water off, can cause a sewer collapse or a spill, that have dramatic effects to both the economy and the public health.” For wastewater managers in the region, part of the funding shortfall is a result of stricter federal requirements aimed at reducing pollutant levels in local streams and rivers and, ultimately, the Chesapeake Bay. For example, D.C. Water is spending $2.6 billion to meet the requirements of a 2005 federal consent decree to nearly eliminate overflows of sewage and storm water to the Anacostia, Potomac and Rock Creek waterways by 2030. Another Environmental Protection Agency effort to significantly reduce levels of pollutants entering the Chesapeake Bay by 2025 has meant an extra $1 billion in upgrade costs for D.C. Water, about $1.9 billion for Montgomery County and about $660 million for Fairfax County, officials said. The money going into those efforts eats into funds that are also needed for other kinds of maintenance, including upgrades to underground pipes that, in many cases, are too narrow to accommodate the amount of wastewater generated by the region’s increasingly dense population. “Once you start to fall behind, you can’t catch up,” said Randy Bartlett, who oversees storm-water and wastewater management for Fairfax County. “Now, we’ve got this big catch-up.” Millions of dollars will be needed to upgrade the region’s outdated 911 emergency system, the Council of Governments report says. The system uses old technology based on the services provided by traditional telecommunications carriers, which can be unreliable when someone is using a mobile phone to seek help. Officials are working toward building a more comprehensive network that would link emergency call centers throughout the region to a secure computer network. That system could also sync with a person’s computerized medical information. In its report, the Council of Governments recommends creating a regional infrastructure exchange to better coordinate such efforts. “It gives a framework for the officials in this region to explore the different opportunities that are out there,” Walz said. “Sometimes they can put together a broader financial package that ends up being less expensive for everybody.” Local and state officials are juggling limited funds. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) recently reduced the state’s share of the cost of the planned light-rail Purple Line in the Washington suburbs, and he killed a separate light-rail project planned for Baltimore, in part to free up hundreds of millions of dollars for what he described as long-overdue road and bridge improvements. The hard reality with infrastructure spending is, “the need is always going to outweigh the amount,” Maryland State Highway Administration spokesman David Buck said. In the Coral Hills area of Prince George’s County, Gwen Bowman says she and her neighbors have lived with unmet needs for years, even though their enclave is part of a Transforming Neighborhoods Initiative meant to improve residents’ quality of life. Several of the neighborhood’s streets don’t have sidewalks, and the roads “look like a quilt” with tar patches covering old potholes, Bowman said. “They’re taking care of the low-hanging fruit, which is basically just keeping the streets clean,” Bowman said Residents in the Mount Vernon area of Fairfax County see the effects of festering problems every time it rains. They pin a jump in local flooding to storm-water pipes that are too narrow to accommodate runoff now that water-absorbing trees, grass and soil have been replaced with new structures, including a row of portable classroom trailers at Washington Mill Elementary School. “There is a sheeting of water and a new creek coming through here whenever it rains,” said Louise Sloan, who lives behind the school. Fairfax County officials are asking voters to pass a $310 million bond referendum in November that would fund renovations at nine county schools. The county is also asking voters to approve $151 million for improvements to fire stations, police stations and other public buildings that have worn down with time. “Sometimes people are supportive of building new things because they’re getting something that’s brand new, that they hadn’t had before,” said Sharon Bulova (D), chairman of the Fairfax Board of Supervisors. “But they may not fully appreciate the need to replace the older infrastructure.”	281	"[{""start"": 3812, ""end"": 3906, ""text"": ""overflows of sewage and storm water to the Anacostia, Potomac and Rock Creek waterways by 2030"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	289	2023-03-28T13:33:29.542151Z	2023-03-28T13:33:29.542250Z	0.618
The attention of the District’s civic elite is turning to the health of the Anacostia River. The Federal City Council, the buttoned-up gathering of the city business titans, said Monday that it was adding the restoration of the long-polluted waterway to its short list of priority issues. The announcement comes as the Summit Fund of Washington, a philanthropic venture of energy executive Roger W. Sant, prepares to wind down, ending its substantial funding of Anacostia River organizations. It also comes 18 months after former mayor Anthony A. Williams, a staunch advocate of focusing new development on the river’s banks, took the council’s helm. Williams said in a statement that the council is looking forward  to joining local governments and other groups working to “transform the Anacostia into a showcase for a world class capital city.” Kevin Clinton, the council’s chief operating officer, said the group’s decision to embark on a major environmental initiative for the first time was “largely due” to Williams’s personal interest in the river “as a symbol of the divide in D.C. between east and west, but also as a symbol of the city’s potential.” “It’s just something he’s personally committed to and personally passionate about,” Clinton said. The group has hired Doug Siglin — a veteran of clean-water advocacy, most recently at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation — to manage its Anacostia efforts. His first task, he said, has been to meet with other groups involved in the river’s well-being to stake out areas of common ground. “We’ve had very good conversations with almost all the players,” Siglin said. “We’re going to try a create a new source of funding. … There is anxiety because a lot of the groups are very small operations, and the Summit Fund has been a big part of their funding for a long time.” Beyond the funding question, likely to be addressed though the creation of a nonprofit trust, Siglin said the Federal City Council expects to get involved in the large-scale aspects of cleaning up the river. With a multibillion-dollar plan to end sewage deposits in the river now underway, those are likely to include how to mitigate polluted storm runoff and how best to address the decades of contaminants deposited on the river bottom. The efforts, Clinton said, fit squarely in the council’s wheelhouse of pursuing ambitious projects that benefit the city as a whole and require engagement over a broader timeframe than the usual political cycles. The council remains engaged, he said, in its effort to promote public education reform, address downtown congestion, pursue new vehicles of infrastructure financing and improve the tourism industry. Restoring the Anacostia, Siglin said, is an ambitious project, but not so ambitious that the council can’t have a significant impact. “It’s a very different situation than, say, St. Louis,” Siglin said. “It can’t by itself clean up the river. … With cooperation from our partners in Montgomery County and Prince George’s County, the District can actually get this done.”	280	"[{""start"": 2113, ""end"": 2261, ""text"": ""hose are likely to include how to mitigate polluted storm runoff and how best to address the decades of contaminants deposited on the river bottom."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	288	2023-03-28T13:29:27.213369Z	2023-03-28T13:29:27.213436Z	4.281
For almost seven years, James Foster has been working for the Anacostia River. But only for the last few months has he been working on the river. “I love being on the water. I almost don’t care if it’s in a rowboat or in the S.S. Minnow or whatever,” Foster said recently, sitting on a barge moored east of Fort McNair. “For me, it’s a logical and spiritual connection.” Foster is president of the Anacostia Watershed Society , which is headquartered upriver in Bladensburg. Since May, the organization has had an auxiliary office on two barges anchored at the Eastern Power Boat Club. Formerly the property of the Gangplank Marina, the barges were relocated to facilitate construction of the Wharf redevelopment along the Washington Channel. “I’m working to clean up this river. So this is where I need to be,” Foster said. “This is where the people are.” Actually, aside from boaters and rowers, there don’t seem to be many people on this section of the Anacostia. The recently built bike trail gets little traffic, and the section of Water Street SE that leads to the marina hits a dead end. But change is coming, Foster predicted. “You can see it reflected in the economic development that’s happening around Nats Park,” about a dozen blocks to the west, he said. “People are coming back there, and they’re anticipating that the water’s going to be clean. They want to walk along the river; they want to have waterfront property.” So far, the two AWS barges have been used only for office work and meetings. “I’m still not quite ready to bring mass quantities of people in here,” Foster said. “The infrastructure’s still a little not done, shall we say.” AWS has installed a composting toilet in one of the barges, and may add solar power and green roofs. In the long term, though, the organization expects its D.C. outpost will be at the 11th Street Bridge Park, projected to open in 2019. As part of that project, AWS will have a classroom and a dock for canoes and kayaks. That will support the organization’s Saturday Environmental Academy, a 10-week spring and fall program for children from Wards 7 and 8. It could also provide a landing for Foster, who sometimes commutes from Bladensburg by boat. A recently published AWS brochure, titled “A Waterway to 2025,” reflects the organization’s goal of having a swimmable and fishable Anacostia within 10 years. “I think we should be able to expect to get in the water without having to check a Web site,” Foster said. “I think that we should able to eat the fish from the water without having to worry that they’re contaminated with PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls). Right now, about 50 percent of our resident catfish are contaminated and have tumors and lesions.” Foster acknowledged that AWS has set an ambitious timetable. “Whether it’s going to be 2025, as I say, or 2032, as some of the D.C. officials say, it’s going to be in that time frame,” he said. The river’s principal contemporary pollutant is untreated sewage, which enters from D.C. sewers that combine it with storm water. New tunnels to prevent the overflow are supposed to be in service by 2022. But the Anacostia used to be an industrial river, and toxic waste from that era lingers. Near AWS’s floating office is the site of a former coal-gasification plant that is being cleaned up. The land is slated to become a park, but Foster anticipates more commercial development along this section of river bank — and sees advantages to it. “I need the redevelopment in this watershed to fund the critical infrastructure that wasn’t constructed in the first place,” he said. “The Wharf is a great example. They’re building a giant cistern to capture the storm water that they’ll use for on-site power generation. They’ve got green roofs built in. They just recognize that this is the new normal.” In addition to private developers and the D.C. government, AWS has to coordinate with Maryland, which contains 80 percent of the river’s watershed, and the federal government, which owns about 10 percent of it. “All those folks, they all have their own piece and their own role,” Foster said. “We’re trying to choreograph this, and help facilitate it, but also hold people accountable.” For all Foster’s optimism, he conceded that reclaiming the watershed will involve struggle. “The Anacostia’s always going to be an urban river,” he said. “So it’s going to be like urban combat. We have to go block by block and take it and hold it.” Jenkins is a freelance writer.	279	"[{""start"": 2624, ""end"": 2720, ""text"": ""Right now, about 50 percent of our resident catfish are contaminated and have tumors and lesions"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2917, ""end"": 3045, ""text"": ""The river’s principal contemporary pollutant is untreated sewage, which enters from D.C. sewers that combine it with storm water"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3122, ""end"": 3209, ""text"": ""But the Anacostia used to be an industrial river, and toxic waste from that era lingers"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	287	2023-03-28T13:21:14.553196Z	2023-03-28T13:22:30.954384Z	351.399
The column of dirt, 15 feet of gloppy mud extracted from beneath the murky Anacostia River, has a story to tell. It speaks of the changing composition of the river’s sediment over the past century — sometimes sand, sometimes silt, sometimes gravel, sometimes clay. It offers up a candy wrapper, a piece of a bottle, even a golf ball that went astray in the 1950s and has stayed at the river’s bottom until now. When the color of the mud changes from milk-chocolate brown to petroleum black, the dirt is proclaiming loud and clear the pollution of yesteryear. By laying bare these stories of the watery past, pulled from the depths, the District’s environmental department hopes to write a cleaner tale in the mud of the future. These pillars, more than 130 total, are being extracted from the Anacostia in the first stage of an ambitious and expensive project to map toxins in that dirt and remedy the pollution. The D.C. Council committed last year to completing a plan by June 2018 for cleaning up the river and then to carrying out that plan. Lawmakers and activists talk about the day, after the cleanup is done in a decade or more, that children will be able to learn to swim in the Anacostia’s waters and residents will be able to feast on fish they catch themselves. Reaching that idyllic vision of clean water starts with a prolonged investigation into just how dirty the water is now. Tommy Wells, director of the District Department of the Environment, went on a boat to look at progress of that investigation earlier this month. A 16-member crew from Tetra Tech, a firm contracted by the District, plans by the end of May to finish collecting dozens of samples from the water, fish and riverbed. Watching the technicians dip a set of steel jaws into the murky water, Wells said, “It’s like that arcade game.” He asked what polluted this particular part of the river and was told that the Navy used to manufacture ships nearby. “So Poplar Point, even though it looks pretty green and lush, it’s a pretty nasty place?” he asked. He joked about learning firsthand how badly the Anacostia needs cleaning. “I’m not proud of this, but I flipped my sailboat over by the airport. So I’ve been in this water.” But he won’t commit to seeing that cleanup happen soon. In fact, he said, he isn’t sure the Department of the Environment will meet the June 2018 deadline that the D.C. Council set when he was a member. “Until I know more about the whole process of doing this right now, I’m not going to commit to that date,” he said. “I think it’s very possible to meet the council deadline. . . . I’m not able to certify yet that we will make that date. But we will get there.” When the boats are finished scooping up water and sediment samples, Tetra Tech will complete a report on which spots are polluted by what. At that point, the Department of the Environment will come up with a plan for fixing the pollution, most likely by dredging or putting a cap over the worst spots, according to river cleanup experts. And then, according to federal law, whichever parties have been found to be responsible for the pollution will be required to help pay to clean it up. Those parties might include any of the entities that have operated along the Anacostia for generations: companies such as CSX, the utilities Pepco and Washington Gas, and federal agencies such as the Army at Fort McNair and the Navy at the Navy Yard. In similar circumstances in other cities, divvying up the enormous amount — project manager Dev Murali of the Department of the Environment said it could approach $1 billion in the Anacostia River case — has led straight to a courtroom. Wells said he wants to avoid a court fight in the District, although environmental activists say that is unlikely. “The different parties that will be responsible, I really want them to be on board. I don’t want to have to decide this in a courtroom,” Wells said. “I really don’t want to see [a scientific report] that’s easily challengeable. We really need to back this up by rock-solid science.” What the science looks like, this month, is an iPad on a noisy boat on the Anacostia, telling Tetra Tech contractors where they should hang the vibrating machine over the water and drill through an opening in the bottom of the boat to press a stainless steel core into the earth. It’s a base along the water where those cores, four inches in diameter and filled with sediment, are hoisted onto land and then cooled in a free-standing, walk-in refrigerator that keeps volatile compounds in the dirt from escaping. It’s a tent where the plastic sleeve inside one of those metal cores is slid out and then sliced open with a drill. It’s two scientists quickly sniffing that dirt, some of it exposed to the air at that moment for the first time in a century, with both an electronic nose and their own noses, for the scent of petroleum components. “Often the first indication of whether you have a clean core or a dirty core, if I can use two categories like that, is when you crack it open — the smell,” said Brad Schrotenboer, a technician for Tetra Tech. He moved methodically down the core, from the most recent sediment at the top toward the older stuff at the bottom. Inch by inch, he peered at the dirt to check its consistency and color, rubbed it between his fingers, and picked up chunks to hold to his nose. With each break in the core’s composition, Schrotenboer and colleague Ryan Murley filled jars with the mud, to be sent to a lab in Pittsburgh that will analyze them. Those samples will be tested for all of the suspected pollutants of the past: mercury, cyanide, carcinogenic PCBs and about a half dozen others. “Every core tells a story,” Schrotenboer said. “It’s a real look back into the past,” Murley added. And if their work leads to a swimmable, fishable Anacostia, then that long-buried core is also a look into the future.	278	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 410, ""text"": ""n of dirt, 15 feet of gloppy mud extracted from beneath the murky Anacostia River, has a story to tell.

For environmental activists who fight to clean the District’s dirty waterways, there was no sweeter victory than the one they witnessed in 2004. That year, the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority was forced to settle a federal lawsuit that claimed it failed for decades to stop its Civil War-vintage sewers from spewing pollution. D.C. Water agreed to build three huge tunnels within 20 years to stop pipes from overflowing during hard rains, sending billions of gallons of storm water mixed with raw sewage into Rock Creek and the Potomac and Anacostia rivers every year. “Maybe . . . before I pass away, I can see children swimming in there,” Robert Boone, the former president of the Anacostia Watershed Society, said shortly after the settlement was reached. But now, the three-tunnel solution is in doubt, and activists, engineers and bureaucrats are arguing once again about the best path to cleaner waters. Although digging is underway for the first tunnel, D.C. Water wants to put the other two on hold and instead see whether rain gardens, retention ponds and grass rooftops can soak up as much storm-water runoff as the pipes can store. D.C. Water has asked the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to build an experimental “green infrastructure” project and run tests for at least eight years. The green project would be built where the second and third tunnels were slated to run, along Rock Creek Parkway near the Kennedy Center to protect the Potomac River and in Upper Northwest neighborhoods to protect Rock Creek. A 13-mile tunnel under the Anacostia River and deep into the Northeast near a Home Depot off Rhode Island Avenue, currently under construction, would continue as planned. The EPA is considering D.C. Water’s proposed “partnership agreement,” and a decision on whether to move forward with public hearings on the changes is expected soon. Among local environmental activist groups, a verdict on the request is already clear: Don’t do it. Some are enraged; others have expressed dismay about the proposal. “We’re well down the road to the tunnel solution, and I’m a little ambivalent about changing course midstream,” said Brent Bolin, a spokesman for the Anacostia Watershed Society. Opponents say that if the green pilot project wins approval, billions of gallons of sewage would pour into the Potomac and Rock Creek for eight years while D.C. Water conducts its tests. The proposed agreement played a major role in the recent firing of the head of the D.C. Department of the Environment (DDOE), Christophe Tulou. He said he believed the green infrastructure project had no hope of performing as well as the utility claimed, and he allowed experts in his department to say as much in comments on the project submitted to the EPA. In a recent interview at his home, Tulou, now unemployed, said his department “had no beef about green infrastructure. But there are still issues one has to resolve . . . how effective is green infrastructure in mitigating storm-water runoff. We don’t know exactly.” But others who support Tulou were more harsh in their criticism, saying green infrastructure is a stall tactic, an attempt to delay a portion of the $2.6 billion cost of the Clean Rivers tunnel project. “From our perspective, this proposal is purely about delays . . . that is the purpose behind it,” said Jennifer C. Chavez, a staff attorney for Earthjustice, a nonprofit legal organization that represented several groups in a lawsuit against the utility in 2000. D.C. Water’s general manager, George Hawkins, has said the “green” project is superior to the “gray” pipes because it would cool and beautify the city if tests are successful and the program is allowed to expand. Hawkins convinced Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) of the project’s worthiness early last year. Gray sent two letters of support to EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in March and July, without consulting experts in his office for their opinions on whether it would work. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) initially favored green infrastructure, but not at the expense of the two tunnels in the original agreement. When Mendelson learned that D.C. Water and city officials were negotiating a partnership agreement, he also wrote a letter to the EPA administrator, withdrawing his support for the green project. Green infrastructure should be included with all three tunnels or be left out altogether, Mendelson wrote. To clean the water, the District needs what D.C. water originally agreed in court to build, not a hybrid of a tunnel for the Anacostia watershed and something else for Rock Creek and the Potomac. According to Tulou, Shawn Garvin of the EPA asked his department to submit comments on D.C. Water’s proposal. Within days, DDOE submitted comments that said the “green infrastructure” project was vague, lacking information on how the tests would be conducted, who would pay for the upkeep and maintenance of the gardens and a detailed estimate of how much pollution would pour into the rivers and creeks during testing. Gray felt that his support for the project was being upstaged. On the last day of August, Tulou was terminated by City Administrator Allen Lew, who sits on D.C. Water’s board of directors. Lew said DDOE’s criticism represented a “breach of protocol.” Gray replaced Tulou with Keith A. Anderson, who oversaw sustainable energy and affordable energy plans at DDOE. An official in Gray’s administration, who spoke anonymously because firings are a personnel matter, said Tulou’s problems went beyond his department’s criticism of D.C. Water. The official said he was often unaware of what his staff was doing, and that he was too by the book to understand an experimental project like green infrastructure. That characterization surprised one of Tulou’s former supervisors, Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), who appointed him as secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control when he was governor of Delaware. “I loved Christophe and did so for 10 years,” said Carper, who served from 1993 until 2001. Carper credited Tulou with successfully drafting rules for development in a sensitive coastal area. “He was great at it,” Carper said. “He’s very good at collaborating. His skill at getting us to yes on a complex issue . . . is viewed by me as important.” Tulou’s dismissal stung environmental activists, who now question Gray’s commitment to the environment, particularly in light of recent actions and statements by Lew. After Tulou’s firing, Lew met with his former staff and warned them against making comments to EPA before getting clearance. His talk had a chilling effect, particularly after a report in the Washington Business Journal suggesting that some of its environmental protections overstepped its role. “I do think it would be fair to say the city administrator is taking a look at the agency to ensure that it’s working the way it’s supposed to . . . that it’s carrying out its regulatory responsibility but . . . not overstepping its role as regulator and moving into the role of advocate,” Tony Robinson, Lew’s spokesman, was quoted as saying. As far as some environmentalists are concerned, Lew’s talk at DDOE and Robinson’s statement reveal a lack of understanding of the department’s role. “DDOE is the environmental conscience of the District,” said Chavez of Earthjustice. D.C. Water and commercial developers often have much higher priorities than protecting fresh waters. “That’s why it’s important for DDOE to be there to weigh in on environmental standards, and we haven’t seen that,” Chavez said.	277	"[{""start"": 326, ""end"": 566, ""text"": ""D.C.
