A former Special Forces soldier once lauded as a hero of the Afghanistan war was notified Thursday that he faces a charge of premeditated murder in connection with the 2010 killing of a suspected Taliban bombmaker, according to the veteran’s attorney and an Army spokesman. A forthcoming Article 32 hearing will assess the evidence against former Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn and determine if the case should go to trial, said Phillip Stackhouse, the attorney. Golsteyn has been investigated by the military since 2011, when authorities say he admitted he had killed the man. His statement came during a polygraph test he took while applying for a job at the CIA, according to Army documents. Lt. Col. Loren Bymer, a spokesman for Army Special Operations Command, confirmed the charge was read to Golsteyn. A hearing has not yet been scheduled, Bymer said. The prosecution marks the latest twist in the fall of a man who at one point was a highly decorated soldier. It also comes amid a string of other cases in which Special Operations veterans are accused of carrying out serious crimes, including a Navy SEAL who has been charged with murder in the alleged execution of an unarmed Islamic State militant in Iraq and two SEALs and two Marine Raiders who have been charged with murder in the death of a Special Forces soldier in Mali. Stackhouse has maintained that Army investigators exaggerated what Golsteyn said in the CIA job interview. He indicated Thursday that he and Golsteyn will fight the charge. Golsteyn, a 2002 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., led a team from the 3rd Special Forces Group in the Battle of Marja in 2010, earning a Silver Star for his valor. On Feb. 20, 2010, he repeatedly braved enemy fire after watching a Taliban sniper nearly hit a nearby Marine, launching a mission to kill the enemy marksman and coordinating numerous airstrikes, according to a military summary of his actions. Two days earlier, two Marines working with Golsteyn’s unit — Sgt. Jeremy R. McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19 — were killed by improvised explosives. According to Army documents obtained by The Washington Post, Golsteyn later recounted during the job interview that afterward he and his soldiers began searching homes nearby and eventually found materials needed to make bombs like the one that had killed the Marines. Golsteyn said that they brought the suspected bombmaker back to their base and that the man unexpectedly crossed paths with an Afghan tribal leader with whom Golsteyn’s team was working. When the leader expressed fear for his life, Golsteyn grew concerned about the consequences of letting the suspected insurgent go, Army documents said. He is alleged to have then shot the Taliban fighter. “CPT Golsteyn stated he had no qualms about what he did because he couldn’t have lived with himself if [the suspected bombmaker] killed another Soldier or Marine,” an Army investigator’s summary of Golsteyn’s polygraph test said. Army investigators closed an investigation of potential murder and conspiracy charges in 2014, finding that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. But Golsteyn nonetheless was stripped of the Silver Star, and a panel of Army officers in June 2015 decided that he should be separated from the military and issued a letter of reprimand for demonstrating conduct unbecoming of an officer. Golsteyn kept a low profile until October 2016, when he granted a Fox News interview and acknowledged that he had killed a Taliban bombmaker who had been held as a detainee. He said that letting him go would have meant he could later target Afghans who were helping U.S. troops. The Army reopened its investigation two months later. dan.lamothe@washpost.com	708	26	686	2023-04-25T11:29:50.266180Z	2023-04-25T11:29:50.266251Z	31.887	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 272, ""text"": ""A former Special Forces soldier once lauded as a hero of the Afghanistan war was notified Thursday that he faces a charge of premeditated murder in connection with the 2010 killing of a suspected Taliban bombmaker, according to the veteran’s attorney and an Army spokesman"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 461, ""end"": 574, ""text"": ""Golsteyn has been investigated by the military since 2011, when authorities say he admitted he had killed the ma"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2564, ""end"": 2997, ""text"": ""When the leader expressed fear for his life, Golsteyn grew concerned about the consequences of letting the suspected insurgent go, Army documents said.

In a single, surprise tweet, President Trump introduced millions of Americans to Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, a former Special Forces officer who faces a murder charge in the death of a suspected Taliban bombmaker.  The Army notified the soldier last week that he will face prosecution after a years-long investigation of his actions in one of the largest battles of the Afghanistan War. The probe was launched in October 2011, after Golsteyn confessed during a CIA job interview that he killed the Afghan in February 2010 because he worried the man would kill U.S. troops, according to Army documents. Golsteyn’s family and attorney have disputed an Army investigator’s description of his statements, which came during a polygraph test. Golsteyn’s wife, Julie, appeared on “Fox & Friends” on Sunday on his behalf, arguing that her husband has been “ripped apart by his own government” and that they are “waiting for someone to do the right thing.” Minutes later, Trump promised on Twitter that he will review the case, and called Golsteyn a “U.S. Military hero.” White House officials have not answered questions about what the review will include. The president’s elevation of the case reopened a debate over whether he uses the U.S. military as a tool to feed his political base. Trump also dispatched active-duty troops to the southern U.S. border just before the midterm elections, announced on Twitter that he was banning transgender service members and pressed to hold a massive military parade. But Trump’s tweet about Golsteyn also brought to boil something deeper after 17 years of war: Long-simmering arguments about what it means to be a war hero and how U.S. troops should behave in combat while guided by rules of warfare that their enemies do not follow. “A lot of people are taking a side in this without having any idea of the context around it, so it’s very superficial,” said Jason Dempsey, a retired Army officer and Afghanistan veteran who studies the military and society for the Center for a New American Security. “When the tribalism steps in and all of sudden this becomes a red-blue event, or a Fox News event, or a Trump event, it short-circuits anyone even saying, ‘Here’s a complex situation. Maybe I should learn more.’ ” Golsteyn’s case resembles the plot of a movie thriller.  The officer, a 2002 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., commanded a team from 3rd Special Forces Group in the Battle of Marja in February 2010. His actions led to him being labeled as one of its greatest heroes, until the Army decided to punish him. On Feb. 18, 2010, two Marines working with his team — Sgt. Jeremy R. McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19 — were killed when a booby-trapped garage door exploded. U.S. forces searched homes nearby and found the suspected bombmaker, named Rasoul, and bombmaking materials, Golsteyn told the CIA, according to documents first obtained by The Washington Post in 2015. In the interview, the soldier said U.S. troops detained Rasoul. He also said he crossed paths with an Afghan informant on their base. The informant expressed fear for his life if they let Rasoul go. Golsteyn said he believed that if he let the suspected insurgent go, it could lead to the deaths of more U.S. troops. He said he couldn’t live with that.  While the timeline isn’t exactly clear, Golsteyn said, with the help of another American he killed the suspected insurgent after they released him and buried him in a shallow grave. He and two other service members dug up the body at night and disposed of it in a burn pit, Golsteyn said, according to military documents. On Feb. 20, 2010, Golsteyn was involved in separate actions that led to him being decorated for heroism. The Army awarded him a Silver Star after the deployment, crediting him with repeatedly braving enemy fire during a four-hour battle that began with Taliban marksmen opening fire on a lookout point on Golsteyn’s base. The officer launched an ­80-man patrol to find them, slogging through mud and coordinating airstrikes under a barrage of fire. Army investigators reviewing Golsteyn’s actions interviewed more than a dozen service members, some of whom were offered immunity. The case was closed two years later without criminal charges. The Army, however, revoked his Silver Star, and Golsteyn lost his coveted Special Forces tab and was reassigned to the conventional Army. In 2015, a panel of officers at Fort Bragg, N.C., reviewed Golsteyn’s actions. It determined it could not substantiate that Golsteyn violated the rules of armed conflict, but found he demonstrated conduct unbecoming of an officer and recommended his separation from the Army. That could have been the end of the story. But Golsteyn appeared on Fox News in October 2016, admitting to killing a suspected bombmaker. The Army reopened its investigation a month later. An Army spokesman, Lt. Col. Loren Bymer, said investigators have uncovered new information but declined to elaborate, citing the pending legal action. Members of the Golsteyn family and his attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, have mounted a media blitz in recent days, arguing in television interviews that the Army determined in 2015 that the allegations saying the killing was illegal were not substantiated. They also have pointed out accurately that Trump could pardon Golsteyn at any time, or take charge of the case himself. “The president is the commander in chief of the armed forces, and he is also a general court-martial convening authority,” said Zach Spilman, an attorney and contributor to the military justice blog CAAFlog. “Those two roles give him the power to take control of any case under military law, including the Golsteyn case.” Stackhouse said in an interview with The Post that he and the Golsteyns are not attempting to lobby the president through the media. He said they want to correct inaccurate reporting. Golsteyn did not kill a detainee, he said, but a man who had been released. Then Stackhouse proposed an idea that only could be carried out by Trump. “The president can issue a pardon in this case today,” he said. “What better time to take action in a case like Matt’s than during the Christmas season?” Other observers see a strategy taking shape.  Rachel E. VanLandingham, a military justice expert at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles, said placing Golsteyn’s case “in the public square” for discussion is “disgusting” and “brilliant.” “If you think you can play on the president’s desire to throw red meat to his base, go for it,” said VanLandingham, who served as a lawyer in the Air Force. “It’s highly unusual and irregular, but it’s smart.” Veterans watching the case have clashed, arguing over whether Golsteyn is being unfairly targeted by the Army or lionized by supporters despite an alleged war crime. Joe Kassabian, who deployed twice to Afghanistan, said he thinks the length of time that the United States has been at war has led to “this explaining away of abhorrent behavior” carried out by U.S. troops.  “People just saying, ‘He’s at war! What do you expect?’ ” said Kassabian. He pointed out that the United States was on the other side of the issue 74 years ago this month. On Dec. 17, 1944, 84 American prisoners of war who had surrendered after being surprised by a unit of German soldiers were executed in the Malmedy massacre.  Sean Parnell, a former captain in the 10th Mountain Division, said he sees the situation differently. In his estimation, the rules of engagement in combat keep U.S. troops from responding when they otherwise would, creating tough judgment calls.  Parnell recalled a situation in 2006 in which an insurgent infiltrated the Army as a translator and opened fire on his platoon, killing one U.S. soldier and wounding others. Despite there being evidence and surviving witnesses, Parnell said, the military let the man go because of missing paperwork. “We let this guy back on the battlefield,” Parnell said. “He’s out there right now, and I don’t know if he’s alive or dead 10 years later, but he was allowed to go back out onto the battlefield and potentially go back to killing Americans. That drives me insane.” VanLandingham, who once served as the chief of international law for U.S. Central Command, said she thinks the polarized response to Golsteyn’s case speaks to something more enduring than present-day politics. “Human beings like to blame another, and we like to support our troops,” she said. “We’re looking for heroes, and we don’t have that many these days. Maybe our service members are our last heroes. “That makes thinking that they have done something that they shouldn’t have even harder.” dan.lamothe@washpost.com	707	26	685	2023-04-25T11:23:37.449228Z	2023-04-25T11:23:37.449324Z	475.016	"[{""start"": 435, ""end"": 602, ""text"": ""Golsteyn confessed during a CIA job interview that he killed the Afghan in February 2010 because he worried the man would kill U.S. troops, according to Army documents"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3355, ""end"": 3495, ""text"": ""Golsteyn said, with the help of another American he killed the suspected insurgent after they released him and buried him in a shallow grav"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3355, ""end"": 3495, ""text"": ""Golsteyn said, with the help of another American he killed the suspected insurgent after they released him and buried him in a shallow grave"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
President Trump took to the phone in the Oval Office last week after days of speculation. In succession, he notified three U.S. service members accused of war crimes that he was intervening on their behalf and issuing full pardons in two of the cases as Vice President Pence, top political officials and lawyers listened on speakerphone. Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, who faced a murder trial next year in the 2010 death of a suspected Taliban bombmaker, said he expected the call to be quick. But Trump talked to him for nearly 15 minutes, asking questions about his plans for the future and the Pentagon’s application of military justice. “I’m paraphrasing here, but he asked, ‘Did you feel like you were going to get a fair shake or that it was slanted or biased against you?’ ” Golsteyn said in an interview. “I told him, ‘Sir, it was quite clear that the outcome was fixed.’ And he said, ‘Yeah, that was my thoughts, as well.’ ” Trump’s intervention in the cases prompted a sharp backlash from some veterans and legal experts, who said that it will undermine the military justice system and weaken U.S. credibility abroad. But on Thursday, Trump weighed in again, saying in a tweet that he will not allow one of the service members to be ejected from the Navy SEALs. “The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin,” the president wrote. “This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!” Rear Adm. Charles Brown, the Navy’s top spokesman, said in a statement Thursday night that the service is aware of the president’s tweet and awaiting further guidance. How Trump came to believe that the Pentagon could not handle the cases fairly, and ultimately issue the pardons, reflects his tendency to accept the advice of people outside his administration. The president mostly left defense officials out of his discussions about the issue until a few weeks ago and told his top advisers that his supporters would back the move, according to five officials familiar with the situation. Instead, the officials said, Trump discussed the issue with other people in his orbit, including Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality who highlighted the cases on his show and described the service members as heroes facing malicious prosecution. Trump called Hegseth numerous times to discuss the issue and told others about the conversations, according to one current and one former administration official. This account of how Trump reached his decision — and what comes next — is based on interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with the cases, including White House and Pentagon officials. Many of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue and a desire to avoid the president’s ire. In addition to Golsteyn, Trump pardoned former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was convicted in 2013 of two counts of second-degree murder after ordering his soldiers to open fire on unarmed men in Afghanistan. Trump also reinstated the rank of Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who was acquitted of murder in July but convicted of posing for a photo with the remains of an Islamic State fighter. Early this month, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy — both Army veterans — went to the White House to persuade the president not to move forward with his plan. The visit came one day after Hegseth, who did not respond to The Washington Post’s requests for comment, announced on his show that he expected Trump to intervene in the cases. For over an hour, the senior defense officials described what they believe to be the facts of the case, said officials familiar with the meeting. They carried documents and graphics with them and pointed out that Golsteyn was accused of burying the man he had killed, digging up his remains and then moving them. Lorance had been convicted in the deaths of unarmed men, they added. Senior defense officials, who learned about Trump’s plan shortly before Hegseth’s announcement, were convinced that Trump was being fed bad information. Two officials said one document that reached the Oval Office stated that the Afghans killed in Lorance’s case were “gunning” their motorcycle at the soldiers — a point often repeated by conservative pundits. Other soldiers testified at Lorance’s trial that the men killed were a couple hundred yards away and not on a motorcycle when the Americans opened fire. During the meeting, Trump shared the points Hegseth was making, according to one current and one former administration official. The defense officials tried to correct what they saw as misinformation, the officials said. Esper later described the conversation with Trump as “robust.” Trump told other advisers at the White House that, before the meeting, he already had made his decision to issue pardons. Esper sought to delay an announcement, the officials said. Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, argued that the pardons would damage U.S. relationships around the world, and other advisers said it would set a bad precedent. “They were trying to convince the president these guys were actually criminals, not heroes,” one of the officials said. Trump said the system was stacked against the men and it would send a bad message if “we throw people in jail for going to war for us,” the officials said. Trump first signaled publicly that he might wade into war crimes cases last December, after Golsteyn’s wife, Julie, appeared on Hegseth’s program. “At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a ‘U.S. Military hero,’ Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder,” Trump tweeted afterward. “He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas.” The president’s tweet — a surprise to advocates for the service members — altered possibilities, said people familiar with the cases. While Hegseth began discussing the cases with the president, United American Patriots, a nonprofit that advocates for service members charged with war crimes, also sent files to the White House, said David Gurfein, the group’s chief executive. Gurfein said in an interview that UAP provided the information this spring after a congressman — he declined to say who — met with Trump. Several officials said that Trump began making comparisons to the cases of Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier who triggered a massive manhunt in Afghanistan after he deserted his post in 2009 and was captured by militants, and Chelsea Manning, a soldier who leaked a trove of classified information. President Barack Obama traded five Taliban officials for Bergdahl and invited his parents to the Rose Garden before he was court-martialed. Obama shortened Manning’s prison sentence from 35 years to seven in 2017. “Our great warfighters must be allowed to fight,” Trump said in a tweet Sunday. “I would not have done this for Sgt. Bergdahl or Chelsea Manning!” One U.S. official familiar with the discussions said he believes Trump’s mind effectively was made up about Golsteyn after seeing the initial interview with his wife in December. A “cohort” of “insurgents” advocated for the service members for years, one official involved in the campaign said proudly, but the effort gained major traction after Trump took an interest. “I think from the moment that Julie Golsteyn made her first media appearance, the president had already made up his mind about what he wanted to do,” the official said. “But he also was presenting an opportunity to be convinced otherwise.” In May, the president pardoned former 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted in the 2008 murder of an unarmed al-Qaeda detainee in Iraq. Behenna was originally sentenced to 25 years in prison, then was paroled in 2014. He argued for years that he was acting in self-defense. Later that month, the New York Times reported that Trump was considering pardoning other service members accused or convicted of war crimes, on or around Memorial Day, including Golsteyn and Gallagher. The report triggered a backlash, considering Memorial Day’s solemn purpose of honoring those killed in combat. Trump let the holiday pass without acting but acknowledged he was considering issuing pardons for “two or three” service members. “Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard, long,” Trump said the Friday before Memorial Day. “You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight sometime, they get really treated very unfairly.” Gallagher’s murder trial began in June. He was accused of numerous crimes during a 2017 deployment to Mosul, Iraq, including stabbing a wounded Islamic State prisoner in the neck. While the charges stemmed in part from accusations made against him by SEAL teammates, the case fell apart when another SEAL testified under immunity that he had killed the prisoner, not Gallagher. The trial already was under a cloud after a Navy prosecutor, Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, secretly emailed defense attorneys and a Navy Times journalist tracking software in an attempt to search for leaks to the public. The Navy removed Czaplak from the case, but the situation fed concerns aired to the president that the service could not handle the case impartially. Trump intervened afterward, directing the Navy to revoke achievement medals that other prosecutors received for their work on the case. “Not only did they lose the case, they had difficulty with respect to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion,” Trump tweeted. Advocates for Golsteyn highlighted how long the case against him had stretched on and a 2015 finding by an administrative board of officers that declined to substantiate the allegation that he had violated the law of armed conflict. They also noted that one of the investigators, Army Sgt. 1st Class Mark A. Delacruz, was court-martialed in May for lying about the awards and decorations he had earned. In the case of Lorance, advocates stressed that some evidence in his case had been withheld, though nine members of his platoon also testified against him at trial. Trump was lobbied that all three cases reflected overly restrictive rules of engagement during the Obama administration. A position paper prepared by advocates and viewed by The Post said the only way to fix it was for Trump to show good judgment and backbone and reverse the results. Trump’s decision has angered some veterans, military justice experts and members of Congress, even as they acknowledge that Trump has the power to act as commander in chief. “The consequences of Trump pardoning former U.S. service members convicted by their military peers of war crimes are manifold and serious,” said Rachel VanLandingham, a retired military lawyer and military justice expert at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. “It erodes military commanders’ ability to hold their troops accountable for following orders — such as orders not to execute detainees in U.S. custody.” Nearly a week later, Trump’s intervention also has left a string of unanswered questions. While Trump restored Gallagher’s rank, the Navy moved to eject him and three officers who oversaw him — Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil — from the Navy SEALs, a defense official said. “The Navy follows the lawful orders of the President,” the statement said. “We will do so in case of an order to stop the administrative review of . . . Gallagher’s professional qualification.” A Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the service coordinated with the White House before moving to review whether Gallagher and the other SEALs will keep their Tridents. Proceedings against all four men are on hold, the official said. It was unclear how the Army will handle Golsteyn, who remains on active duty, and Lorance, who was dismissed from the service after his conviction. In Golsteyn’s case, the officer was decorated with a Silver Star for valor within a few days of the killing that brought him under scrutiny. That award was later approved for an upgrade to the Distinguished Service Cross — one step down from the Medal of Honor — but the Army stripped him of either decoration and also took away his Special Forces tab. In response to questions, the service did not signal what it will do next. “The Army is implementing the executive orders,” said Lt. Col. Emanuel Ortiz, a service spokesman. “We are currently determining the administrative actions and processes required to fully execute the presidential pardons.” dan.lamothe@washpost.com josh.dawsey@washpost.com	706	26	684	2023-04-25T11:15:38.450990Z	2023-04-25T11:15:38.451054Z	1067.477	"[{""start"": 105, ""end"": 250, ""text"": ""he notified three U.S. service members accused of war crimes that he was intervening on their behalf and issuing full pardons in two of the cases"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 105, ""end"": 250, ""text"": ""e notified three U.S. service members accused of war crimes that he was intervening on their behalf and issuing full pardons in two of the cases"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2848, ""end"": 2997, ""text"": ""Clint Lorance, who was convicted in 2013 of two counts of second-degree murder after ordering his soldiers to open fire on unarmed men in Afghanistan"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3030, ""end"": 3172, ""text"": ""of Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who was acquitted of murder in July but convicted of posing for a photo with the remains of an Islamic State fighter"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3688, ""end"": 3922, ""text"": ""They carried documents and graphics with them and pointed out that Golsteyn was accused of burying the man he had killed, digging up his remains and then moving them.

In the largest battle in the history of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, Mathew L. Golsteyn watched to see if the man he believed was responsible for killing two U.S. Marines was coming his way. Golsteyn, a captain and Green Beret soldier at the time, said he had taken up an ambush position in the Taliban stronghold of Marja when U.S. forces released the man, a suspected Taliban bombmaker known as Rasoul. What happened next is at the center of an Army investigation that has stretched years, resulting in a murder charge against Golsteyn in December. Golsteyn didn’t know whether the suspected insurgent, who was unarmed at the time, would walk in his direction. But if he did, to Golsteyn it meant he was going back to insurgent activities and could be legally targeted. “If [he goes] any other direction of the 360 that you have available to you but mine, and he doesn’t meet me,” Golsteyn said. “He had been released, and are you going to go back to what you were doing? Or are you going to go somewhere else? If it had been me, this guy’s a-- would have beaten feet in a completely different direction.” The incident first came under scrutiny by the Army in October 2011, the same year Golsteyn was awarded a Silver Star for valor in different actions. Golsteyn said he had planned to join the CIA and go to Iraq in 2012, and in a polygraph test for the CIA he said he had killed an unarmed man and burned the body. The case has become a cause celebre among some conservative and veterans groups, and caught the attention of President Trump late last year after Golsteyn’s wife, Julie, appeared on Fox News. In a Dec. 16 tweet, the president pledged to review the case “at the request of many” and called Golsteyn a “a U.S. Military hero.” The case also has re-energized long-running arguments about how U.S. troops should behave in combat while guided by rules that their enemies often do not follow, and how the military should treat a war hero if he is suspected of war crimes. Golsteyn, 38, has rarely discussed the case in public, leaving it to his wife, civilian attorney Phillip Stackhouse and other supporters. But in a two-hour interview with The Washington Post, he defended his actions and lambasted Army investigators for how they characterized his actions in official reports. Golsteyn said he is grateful for the president’s attention and would welcome a pardon but cannot expect it. “It’s not an insignificant thing living every day knowing that you’re an enemy of the state,” said Golsteyn, who was recalled to active duty as a major to face the charge. “We are playing for a court-martial. It would be pretty dangerous to be playing for a pardon, and then there is no pardon and we have to go to court-martial.” The Army has declined to comment on how it has handled Golsteyn’s case. A spokesman, Lt. Col. Loren Bymer, said Golsteyn was charged after new evidence emerged, and an Article 32 hearing is scheduled for March 14 at Fort Bragg in North Carolina to assess whether the case should proceed to a trial. “As an active law enforcement matter, the U.S. Army cannot comment on or release information related to the case,” Bymer said. Golsteyn met with The Post in Washington at the headquarters of the International Association of Fire Fighters, a union for which Golsteyn serves as chief of operations. He took the job while preparing to move on from Army life, settling in Northern Virginia in August 2016, marrying Julie in May 2017 and having a son with her last year. He also has a 12-year-old-son from a previous marriage. In Golsteyn’s office at work hangs military memorabilia from his career and a photo of him shaking President George W. Bush’s hand in 2002 as a new graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. Golsteyn deployed to Iraq in 2003 and Afghanistan in 2009 after undergoing heart surgery in 2006 stemming from an accident at the Special Forces Underwater Operations School near Key West, Fla. In January 2010, Golsteyn was deployed to Afghanistan with the 3rd Special Forces Group. As commander of Operational Detachment Alpha 3121, he would lead not only his unit but also about 30 Marines and 300 Afghan soldiers in a major offensive against the Taliban involving a total of 15,000 coalition and Afghan troops.  The Battle of Marja would prove to be far more violent than other missions.  For days, Golsteyn and his troops faced hours of gunfights. Explosives laced the city, and he and other service members were frustrated with rules of engagement that were designed to prevent civilian casualties but limited how aggressively they could target the Taliban. On Feb. 18, a booby-trapped garage door exploded, killing Sgt. Jeremy McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19, Marine combat engineers deployed alongside Golsteyn’s unit. After a search, Afghan forces detained a man with bombmaking material. But Golsteyn said U.S. forces were told they could not keep any detainees because of the amount of resources doing so would require. Golsteyn targeted the suspected bombmaker in circumstances that are still mysterious and central to the case. With a criminal charge pending, he declined to answer some questions, including how long the man had been free before he was killed, whether anyone else was with Golsteyn at the time and whether he reported the killing to anyone afterward. “He probably had anywhere from between . . .” Golsteyn said of Rasoul, before stopping mid-sentence. “To be honest, I don’t know because I was out [away from the base]. He had a long walk,” Golsteyn continued. “He had a long time to figure out where he was going in life.” Rachel E. VanLandingham, a military justice expert at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles, said the specifics of how Golsteyn targeted the man are central to the case. If Rasoul showed hostile intent and Golsteyn used authorized tactics to target him, it would appear he committed no wrongdoing, she said. However, if he “was in actuality lying in wait for this guy,” she said, the situation is different. “In other words, we may have a legitimate killing based on individual self-defense in response to conduct that demonstrates hostile intent, or we could have premeditated murder,” said VanLandingham, who once served as the chief of international law for U.S. Central Command. “Context of the ambush is everything.” Golsteyn acknowledged disposing of the man’s body after the shooting and said it was not uncommon for U.S. troops to burn remains that went unclaimed in the war. In his earlier statements to the CIA, he said a couple of other soldiers were involved. “We had bodies everywhere from aircraft fire, sitting in pools of water and we had to, when we came on the, dispose of them,” Golsteyn said. “There is no one to claim them. There was disease and pestilence, and on top of that it’s a source of booby traps and a huge hazard to our force.” The case has been clouded by characterizations of Golsteyn’s actions in Army investigative reports.  An agent with U.S. Criminal Investigation Command who watched a recording of Golsteyn’s polygraph test wrote in one early report that Golsteyn told his interviewers that he and one other U.S. soldier had taken the deceased Afghan “back to his residence and assassinated him.” But Army officials conceded at a 2015 administrative hearing known as a Board of Inquiry that Golsteyn did not say that, Golsteyn said. The Army declined to comment. The Army has declined to release the transcript of Golsteyn’s job interview that spawned the investigation or the 2015 hearing. A panel of three officers voted 2 to 1 that the service had not substantiated that Golsteyn violated the law of armed conflict, but it found he had demonstrated conduct unbecoming of an officer. The Army initially closed its investigation in November 2013 without finding enough evidence to prosecute Golsteyn, even when offering immunity to his fellow soldiers. It pursued a number of administrative punishments instead, including the suspension of his security clearance, the revocation of his Silver Star and Special Forces tab, and the issuing of a career-ending memorandum of reprimand. The Silver Star was awarded in 2011 for repeatedly braving enemy fire on Feb. 20, 2010, two days after the Marines were killed. Golsteyn was credited with braving fire during a four-hour battle in which he trudged through mud, returned fire, helped an Afghan soldier who had been shot and coordinated airstrikes. The Army reopened its investigation in 2016, after Golsteyn appeared on Fox News and acknowledged killing a bombmaker in an interview with Bret Baier. “There’s limits on how long you can hold guys, Golsteyn said at the time. “You realize quickly that you make things worse. It is an inevitable outcome that people who are cooperating with coalition forces, when identified, will suffer some terrible torture or be killed.” Golsteyn told The Post that he has found the Army’s investigation dishonest, and he can no longer stay silent about it. “I spent half of this hell quiet, and if there is anything I know, it’s that I will not get any semblance of due process — any ability to defend myself — if it’s not in public,” he said. “Because it’s the only thing these guys respond to. They do not obey their own rules.” dan.lamothe@washpost.com	705	26	683	2023-04-25T10:57:46.879864Z	2023-04-25T10:57:46.880035Z	953.54	"[{""start"": 1326, ""end"": 1418, ""text"": ""and in a polygraph test for the CIA he said he had killed an unarmed man and burned the body"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 8519, ""end"": 8618, ""text"": ""Golsteyn appeared on Fox News and acknowledged killing a bombmaker in an interview with Bret Baier."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
Before he spent five years in prison for murdering a suspected al-Qaeda detainee, Michael Behenna was a rising military officer from a prominent law enforcement family. An Army Ranger in the famed 101st Airborne Division, Behenna deployed to Iraq in 2007 at the height of the U.S. troop surge, leading an infantry platoon of 18 men. Behenna — whose mother helped prosecute Oklahoma City bomber Timothy Mc­Veigh and whose father worked as an FBI analyst and Oklahoma state investigator — has always insisted he acted in self-defense when he killed Ali Mansur. Behenna was paroled five years ago after an effort to overturn his conviction failed. Now he is seeking a different path to vindication: a presidential pardon. It is a bold ask for someone who stripped a prisoner naked, interrogated him without authorization, shot him twice and then claimed at his court-martial that he was protecting himself. But Behenna, now a 35-year-old ranch hand, is pitching his case at an opportune moment for U.S. military members accused of war crimes. Prompted by adulatory profiles on “Fox &amp; Friends,” President Trump has voiced support for a Navy SEAL and a Green Beret who have been charged with murder but haven’t faced trial yet. Trump tweeted last month that Eddie Gallagher — a Navy SEAL charged with fatally stabbing a teenage ISIS prisoner under his care in Iraq and then holding his reenlistment ceremony with his corpse — would be moved to a less restrictive confinement before his trial. “In honor of his past service to our Country,” Trump said on Twitter. And in December, Trump tweeted that he would review the case of Matt Golsteyn, an Army major and former Green Beret who admitted to killing a suspected Taliban bombmaker in Afghanistan and burning his body. “A U.S. Military hero,” Trump declared on Twitter. There are signs that lobbying efforts on Behenna’s behalf may be having an impact, too. “We know we have a president who is very sympathetic to the very difficult situation that soldiers, sailors and Marines were put in during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,” said John Richter, a former head of the Justice Department’s criminal division who is representing Behenna and has spoken to White House officials about his case. Behenna was told that he had to complete his parole in 2024 before he could seek a pardon recommendation from the Justice Department. But two months ago, he said he learned that the agency might be considering his application, after all. Rosalind Sargent-Burns, the agency’s deputy pardon attorney, had called with questions about his case. “Sounds like your pardon request and paperwork [are] being processed,” Behenna’s parole officer texted him. Sargent-Burns declined a request to discuss Behenna’s case. Since Behenna’s conviction, elected officials and retired military brass have come forward to support his unsuccessful court appeals and, more recently, his pardon request. Among his backers: former Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin (R) and state Attorney General Mike Hunter (R), as well as more than three dozen retired generals and admirals, including retired Gen. Anthony Zinni, who, up until January, served as a Trump administration special envoy for the Persian Gulf. Behenna is hopeful but cautious. A presidential pardon, which can be granted only to people convicted of federal crimes, can restore the right to vote, the ability to hold political office, obtain certain jobs, or, as Behenna would like to do, adopt a child. “I am not expecting anything, because this is a lesson I learned years ago in my trial,” said Behenna, who called the pardon “a way to ask for forgiveness from the country I fought for . . . and a way for me to get justice for a trial that was unjust.” Carnage from a roadside bomb On April 21, 2008, Behenna was riding in the second of a three-truck convoy north of Baghdad when the third vehicle behind him suddenly shot into the sky, blown up by a roadside bomb. As Behenna, then a 24-year-old lieutenant, looked out the side mirror, whorls of smoke and dust blanketed the air. He made his way to the third truck and immediately performed CPR on his dying comrade, Sgt. Adam Kohlhaas, 26. A second friend, Sgt. Steven Christofferson, 20, who lost a coin toss and had to man the gun turret, was also killed — his body cut in half after the truck landed 75 feet from the blast site on its top. Behenna was familiar with explosions and death before he arrived in Iraq. He was in fifth grade in 1995 when Mc­Veigh, a Persian Gulf War veteran, detonated a truck bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, killing 168 people. One of the victims was Behenna’s middle-school baseball coach. But he’d never seen carnage up close. Shortly after his friends’ deaths in the roadside bombing, Behenna seized on a new intelligence report revealing the identity of an al-Qaeda operative who possibly helped orchestrate the explosion: Ali Mansur. Mansur was found at his house with several weapons, including an illegal machine gun and an Iraqi passport indicating that he’d made two trips to Syria, “a known training ground for terrorists,” according to Behenna’s pardon application. Mansur was interrogated but freed because the military could not find conclusive evidence linking him to the explosion, the pardon application says. Behenna was livid when Mansur was released. And it was Behenna who was ordered to transport him back to his village and set him free. 'In total shock' Less than a month later, out by a secluded railroad culvert near the northern town of Baiji, Behenna decided to interrogate Mansur again on his own. “I stripped him naked to intimidate him,” Behenna said. “I told him I wanted more intel on local leaders of al-Qaeda, and that I wanted him to tell me about his stops in Saudi Arabia and Syria, and the [roadside] bomb explosion. But he kept saying, ‘I don’t know. I don’t know.’ ” Finally, Mansur said something in Arabic that Behenna didn’t understand. He turned to his interpreter for help, he said, but that’s when he heard something hit the culvert’s wall. When he pivoted back to the prisoner, Behenna claims Mansur had just thrown a rock and was now standing up and reaching for his Glock. Behenna stepped to the side and fired one shot into Mansur’s chest, the next to his head. “I was in disbelief that just happened,” Behenna recalled. “I just remember this numb feeling. I was in total shock.” Behenna left the body in the culvert and didn’t tell anyone. Then he went back to his base. The next day, Iraqi police found Mansur’s body, and Behenna was later charged with premeditated murder. He faced life in prison without parole. The whole time their son was under investigation, his parents, lifelong criminal investigators, said they never felt disappointed or embarrassed. “When he got charged, I wasn’t like, ‘Dear God, what are people going to think?’ I was thinking, ‘What can I do to help my son?’ ” recalled Vicki Behenna, who is now the executive director of the Oklahoma Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted. At his 2009 court-martial, military prosecutors at Fort Campbell, Ky., told the jury they believed Behenna executed Mansur to avenge the loss of his two soldiers in the roadside explosion, according to press coverage of the trial. Prosecutors said Behenna ordered another soldier, Staff Sgt. Hal Warner, to burn the body with an “incendiary” grenade — an accusation that Behenna denies and that two other witnesses said they never heard. (Warner pleaded guilty to assault, maltreatment of a subordinate and making a false statement and was sentenced to 17 months in prison.) As his trial wound down, Behenna took the stand. “I was scared Ali Mansur was going to take my weapon and use it against me,” he told the military panel of seven officers. “This happened very fast.” He described the sequence of his movements — turning to face Mansur and stepping to the left before firing two shots. In the gallery, the government’s own forensics expert was listening, concerned, according to Behenna’s pardon application. The expert had outlined a similar scenario to prosecutors the day before. But the prosecution rested its case without calling the expert, portraying Behenna as an unprovoked aggressor. The next day, Behenna was found guilty of unpremeditated murder, a result that spared him of the possibility of life in prison without parole. Still, he filed for a mistrial, contending prosecutors hid exculpatory evidence — a constitutional violation — and should have immediately alerted him since the expert’s testimony could have benefited his case. The judge denied the motion. Behenna appealed to a higher court for a new trial, but lost, 3 to 2. Ultimately, Behenna’s 25-year sentence was reduced to 15. In early 2013, four years into his prison term at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., 37 retired military generals and admirals, including five four-stars, sent an amicus brief to the Supreme Court urging the justices to review his case and clarify the self-defense rights of service members in combat zones. “[A]ssuming that Lieutenant Behenna’s claim that Mansur lunged for his weapon is truthful — an assumption made by [the country’s highest military appeals court] that this Court must also make — it would have been a dereliction of duty for Lt. Behenna not to fire in self-defense,” they wrote. Though the Supreme Court didn’t accept his case, Behenna was released a year later on March 14, 2014, a moment the Oklahoman featured on its front page with an enormous photo of Behenna hugging his sister-in-law, while his mother was bawling off to the side. Now, as Behenna seeks another front-page headline, he spends his days near his hometown north of Oklahoma City, feeding cattle on a commercial ranch and raising goats and chickens at his own 20-acre property. In his living room, he displays a framed photograph of Kohlhaas and Christofferson with the son of an Iraqi villager sitting between them. His comrades are smiling and laughing, and the boy is wearing one of their helmets and a pair of their sunglasses. It was taken the day before they were killed — and the day before Behenna’s life changed. “I was responsible for them,” Behenna said. “I’m afraid if I didn’t see the picture as often as I do, then maybe I would forget them.” ian.shapira@washpost.com	704	26	682	2023-04-25T10:41:49.283189Z	2023-04-25T10:41:49.283278Z	1299.452	"[{""start"": 719, ""end"": 902, ""text"": ""It is a bold ask for someone who stripped a prisoner naked, interrogated him without authorization, shot him twice and then claimed at his court-martial that he was protecting himself"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1275, ""end"": 1422, ""text"": ""a Navy SEAL charged with fatally stabbing a teenage ISIS prisoner under his care in Iraq and then holding his reenlistment ceremony with his corpse"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5576, ""end"": 6317, ""text"": ""Behenna decided to interrogate Mansur again on his own. “I stripped him naked to intimidate him,” Behenna said. “I told him I wanted more intel on local leaders of al-Qaeda, and that I wanted him to tell me about his stops in Saudi Arabia and Syria, and the [roadside] bomb explosion.

President Trump intervened in three cases involving war crimes accusations on Friday, issuing full pardons to two soldiers and reversing disciplinary action against a Navy SEAL despite opposition raised by military justice experts and some senior Pentagon officials. The White House said in a statement Friday night that Trump, as commander in chief, is “ultimately responsible for ensuring that the law is enforced and when appropriate, that mercy is granted.” “For more than two hundred years, presidents have used their authority to offer second chances to deserving individuals, including those in uniform who have served our country,” the statement said. The service members were notified by Trump over the phone late Friday afternoon, according to lawyers for Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn and former Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, the SEAL. Golsteyn faced a murder trial scheduled for next year, while Gallagher recently was acquitted of murder and convicted of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. The third service member, former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, was expected to be released Friday night from prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. He was convicted of second-degree murder in 2013 and sentenced to 19 years for ordering his soldiers to open fire on three men in Afghanistan. Golsteyn and Lorance received full pardons, while the president will direct the Navy to restore Gallagher to his previous rank before he retires, the White House said. His demotion marked the only significant penalty he received following his acquittal on the murder charge. The news, first reported by The Washington Post ahead of the White House announcement, came at the tail end of a day dominated by impeachment hearings and efforts by some senior Pentagon officials to change Trump’s mind, according to three U.S. officials. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said some commanders have raised concerns that Trump’s move will undermine the military justice system. Other U.S. officials and advocates for the service members have said that carrying out the president’s order should not be difficult. The system has commanders overseeing the legal process in the military’s chain of command, with Trump serving at the top as commander in chief. The Army said in a statement Friday night that it will implement the pardons of Golsteyn and Lorance, and acknowledged the president’s powers to grant pardons. “The Army has full confidence in our system of justice,” the statement said. “The Uniform Code of Military Justice ensures good order and discipline for uniformed service members while holding accountable those who violate its provisions. The foundation of military law is the Constitution, and the Constitution establishes the President’s power to grant pardons.” In all three cases, advocates for the service members had criticized the Pentagon for its handling of their cases, detailing what they saw as questionable actions by prosecutors and investigators. Their cases have been featured frequently on conservative media, as advocates prepared cases for the president behind the scenes. The White House statement on Friday cited the advocacy of several Republican congressmen, as well as Bing West, an author who embedded with Golsteyn’s unit and served in the Pentagon during the Reagan administration, and Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality who served in the Army. Phillip Carter, a former Army officer and Obama administration official, said that presidents have tended to support the military justice system and its verdicts to support good order and discipline. The military, he said, has “worked for decades to lay the ghosts” of the Vietnam War and war crimes committed during it to rest, and Trump’s decision risks undermining that. “Executive clemency like this introduces doubt into the chain of command, and creates uncertainty about accountability for breaches of military rules,” said Carter, who now studies national security for the Rand Corp. Past presidents have occasionally weighed in on military justice, however. In 2017, former president Barack Obama shortened a 35-year prison sentence for Chelsea Manning, the soldier who leaked a trove of classified information to WikiLeaks, to seven years. In 1971, former president Richard Nixon intervened in the case of William L. Calley Jr., who was convicted of murdering 22 people in Vietnam and sentenced to life in prison. Nixon called for Calley to serve under house arrest at Fort Benning, Ga., instead of in prison at Fort Leavenworth. The soldier eventually saw his sentence reduced under appeal, and served 3½ years under house arrest. The facts of the three cases vary. In Golsteyn’s, the Special Forces officer went from being regarded as one of the Army’s heroes in the Afghanistan war to under investigation in the 2010 death of an unarmed man in a combat zone. The case first emerged after Golsteyn, who had been awarded a Silver Star for valor on the same deployment, said during a polygraph test while applying for a job with the CIA that he had killed the man and burned his body. Golsteyn said the man was a suspected Taliban bombmaker who had just crossed paths with a tribal elder who was helping U.S. forces in the Taliban stronghold of Marja. Golsteyn, in an interview with The Post this year, said that the man was set free because U.S. forces in his area weren’t authorized to keep detainees. He set an ambush for the man, whom he believed to be responsible for the recent death of two Marines, he said. He reasoned that if the man came in his direction, he was returning to activities with the Taliban. “He had been released, and are you going to go back to what you were doing? Or are you going to go somewhere else?” Golsteyn said. “If it had been me, this guy’s a — would have beaten feet in a completely different direction.” Golsteyn said in a statement on Friday night that his family is “profoundly grateful” for Trump’s action, and that they have lived in “constant fear of this runaway prosecution” by the Army. “Thanks to President Trump, we now have a chance to rebuild our family and lives,” Golsteyn said. “With time, I hope to regain my immense pride in having served in our military. In the meantime, we are so thankful for the support of family members, friends and supporters from around the nation, and our legal team.” In Gallagher’s case, the Navy SEAL faced a court-martial this summer after he was accused of mortally stabbing a wounded Islamic State detainee in the neck and obstruction of justice for allegedly threatening other SEALs who reported him. The murder case against Gallagher fell apart after another SEAL who was offered immunity to testify against him said in court that it was actually him, and not Gallagher, who killed the detainee. The case also saw a Navy prosecutor removed from the case after he sent an email to defense attorneys and a Navy Times journalist in an attempt to determine whether anyone was leaking information to the media. Gallagher’s attorney, Tim Parlatore, said Trump told his client over the phone that he had been watching the case and believed reinstating his old rank was the right thing to do. “The president was very familiar with the prosecutorial misconduct associated with the case,” Parlatore said. “I think that certainly plays into his decision.” In Lorance’s case, nine members of his unit testified against him, including some under immunity. They said under oath that Lorance, as their new platoon leader, had ordered them to open fire on three Afghan men riding motorcycles even though their intent was not clear, after issuing death threats to local leaders. In a Facebook live video published Friday night, Lorance is seen in an Army dress uniform after leaving prison and meeting family members. He thanked Trump and said he spoke to him and Pence on the phone, and that the president is “actually pretty funny.” Lorance said he wanted to be a soldier and didn’t expect “all of this” was going to happen. “It’s kind of overwhelming for a country boy from the middle of nowhere,” he said. “I won’t spoil it, but this is only the beginning. There’s a lot more we gotta do to get things fixed.” The action follows Trump pardoning another veteran, former 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, in May in the 2008 murder of an Iraqi prisoner suspected of being a member of al-Qaeda. Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder and sentenced to 25 years after stripping a detainee naked, interrogating him without authorization and shooting him twice. Behenna said he was acting in self-defense and that the detainee made a move for the officer’s pistol.	703	26	681	2023-04-25T10:20:07.617310Z	2023-04-25T10:20:07.617413Z	1847.213	"[{""start"": 1035, ""end"": 1316, ""text"": ""he third service member, former Army 1st Lt.

When President Obama draped the nation’s highest award for combat valor around the neck of an Afghan war hero at the White House in October 2013, a highly decorated Green Beret officer who sat nearby faced an ugly reality: The Army was investigating him on charges of murder and conspiracy. Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn was invited to the ceremony by William D. Swenson, who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in Afghanistan four years earlier. Like Swenson, Golsteyn had braved enemy fire repeatedly, seen fellow soldiers die and voiced deep frustration with the ways he saw U.S. troops restricted in combat. But Golsteyn, a friend of Swenson’s, also may have had a darker chapter to his service. According to Army documents, the young officer disclosed to CIA personnel during a 2011 job interview that he had killed an unarmed Taliban fighter he suspected of being a bombmaker. The documents, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, also suggest an elaborate cover-up that, if true, could amount to serious war crimes involving not only Golsteyn but fellow Green Beret soldiers. [See document excerpts in the Army’s war-crimes case against Maj. Mathew Golsteyn] However, the service closed a lengthy criminal investigation into the case last year without finding any evidence to charge Golsteyn. His lawyer and other supporters say that the service has exaggerated the claims and selectively released details from the case. The case underscores a stunning fall for a highly regarded officer who has been lauded for his leadership and graduated from the prestigious U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 2002. It has also pitted the Army against a war hero. The Army has defended its actions, saying it had conducted its investigation without bias or outside influence. Phillip Stackhouse, Golsteyn’s lawyer, said the narratives laid out in documents from the Army’s Criminal Investigations Command “are taken out of context and are biased.” “It’s fantasy to say he confessed to shooting an unarmed detainee,” he said. The alleged killing of the Taliban fighter in question took place during the iconic Battle of Marja, during which more than 15,000 coalition troops assaulted a Taliban stronghold of mud compounds, canals and poppy fields in Afghanistan’s Helmand province. Dozens of Americans were killed there in following months, with hundreds more wounded. At the height of the battle, an explosion rocked a Marine unit working alongside Golsteyn’s soldiers in Marja. Two Marines — Sgt. Jeremy R. McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19 — were killed in the Feb. 18, 2010, blast, in which explosives were rigged to detonate when a sliding metal door was opened. Three more Marines were evacuated by helicopter with serious injuries. Two days later, Golsteyn braved enemy fire repeatedly after watching a Taliban sniper round nearly hit another Marine who was manning a rooftop observation post on their base. Golsteyn was credited with launching a mission to find the enemy marksmen, slogging through muddy fields under fire to help an Afghan soldier who had been wounded, returning fire with a powerful anti-tank weapon, and coordinating repeated airstrikes by F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a Predator drone. For those actions, he was awarded the Silver Star, the Army’s third-highest award for valor. [Army revokes Silver Star for Green Beret officer, citing investigation] Army Secretary John McHugh later agreed to upgrade Golsteyn’s award to the Distinguished Service Cross, one step below the Medal of Honor. But the secretary decided last fall that Golsteyn would get neither, citing the investigation. The specifics of the allegations against him were unclear at the time, and officials said only that he faced investigation for an undisclosed violation of the rules of engagement in combat. Golsteyn’s Special Forces tab, a qualification awarded to anyone who has completed Green Beret training, was also revoked by Army Special Forces Command. He was reassigned as an regularly infantry officer, effectively removing him from the Special Forces. The newly obtained documents include a three-page report filed in October 2011 by Special Agent Zachary Jackson, an Army investigator, that allege Golsteyn recounted to the CIA that, after the Marines were killed in the Feb. 18 blast, he and his units began clearing homes nearby. They eventually found materials required to make complicated improvised explosive devices similar to the one that had killed the Marines. They brought the suspected bombmaker back to their base, Golsteyn said, according to Army documents. On base, a tribal leader working with the Americans identified the suspected bombmaker as a member of the Taliban — and then the two crossed paths before Golsteyn could prevent it, the soldier said, according to the documents. The tribal leader “immediately became frightened and stated [the suspected Taliban member] was going to kill him and his family,” the Army documents said. Golsteyn, then a member of 3rd Special Force Group, told the CIA during a polygraph test that he trusted the tribal leader working with his unit, and that information he had provided previously saved lives and prevented attacks, according to Army documents. The suspected bombmaker was not on a list of targets U.S. forces had been cleared to kill without following the rules of engagement, but Golsteyn told the CIA he was concerned that if he let the man go, he would have the opportunity to kill American troops, the documents said. “CPT Golsteyn related there had been countless times when he detained someone and sent that person to a detention facility only to see that same person shooting at his unit weeks later,” the Army investigator’s summary of Golsteyn’s polygraph test said. “CPT Golsteyn stated he had no qualms about what he did because he couldn’t have lived with himself if [the suspected bomb maker] killed another Soldier or Marine.” [CIA job interview leads to criminal investigation of Green Beret] According to the documents, Golsteyn recalled to CIA interviewers that he and one other unidentified U.S. soldier took the suspected bombmaker off the base, shot him to death and buried his remains in a shallow grave. He told the CIA that, later that night, he and two other soldiers dug up the remains, brought them back to their base and burned them in a pit used to dispose of trash, according to the documents. The names of the soldiers have been redacted in the documents released to The Post. Virtually all of the U.S. service members interviewed by investigators expressed disbelief that Golsteyn would have killed an unarmed insurgent or covered up his actions. He is described by most of them as an inspiring, decisive leader who saved lives. In Marja, he led not only his Special Forces team, known as Operational Detachment Alpha 3121, but about 30 Marine combat engineers and more than 300 Afghan commandos who fought alongside it. “I have a hard time believing that such an incident ever occurred,” a senior medic in his unit told investigators in December 2011. “I further find it hard to believe that Matt Golsteyn would do that. The only reason I could possibly conceive him doing something like that is if he felt his men’s lives were at direct risk.” There was at least one exception. A Green Beret lieutenant colonel interviewed in April 2012 told investigators that while Golsteyn was a top captain in Special Forces, he also could be insubordinate and act with a sense of impunity, according to a report filed by an Army investigator at Fort Bragg, N.C. “When asked… whether he believed CPT GOLSTEYN committed the offense of Murder, [the lieutenant colonel] stated he would hope not but would not doubt it either because of CPT GOLSTEYN’S attitude,” the report said. Among officers, Golsteyn could be a polarizing figure, former Marine Capt. Michael Barry, who served alongside Golsteyn in Marja, said in an interview. But he was loved by those he commanded in the field. “I was one of the people who loved him, and I still do just because of the way he led,” Barry said. “He was someone who said what he meant, and there was no backstabbing with him. If you asked him a question, he was going to tell you the truth. He wasn’t going to flower it up.” [Army secretary defends stripping Special Forces officer of awards] Barry, now a law student at Louisiana State University, recalled returning to their base in Marja the day that McQueary and Johnson were killed. While looking for insurgents and weapons in a bazaar with a series of stalls, they asked two suspicious-looking men to open storage units that were locked. The explosion killed the two Afghans along with the Marines. Golsteyn was not at the scene of the explosion that killed them, but was overseeing the mission from their nearby operations center and waiting for troops who survived the blast when they returned. “He was pretty shaken up, and I was pretty shaken up, too,” Barry said. “It meant the world to me that he was there waiting for us when we got back.” Afterward, Golsteyn pulled out a bottle of whiskey on the base so they all could toast the fallen Marines, according to the 2011 book “The Wrong War,” by Bing West, who was embedded with Golsteyn’s unit at the time. The move may have brought those under fire that day closer, but it also drew the attention of commanders when West’s book was published, according to Army documents. Drinking alcohol in the field is a violation of a general order. Investigators keyed in on a remark Golsteyn allegedly made at the time — that his team was going to “get” the man responsible for killing McQueary and Johnson. The conversation ended there, however, Barry said, and wasn’t an uncommon pledge for an officer to make in such circumstances. The Army offered immunity to at least two soldiers in exchange for their testimony against Golsteyn, but they refused to talk, according to the documents. It also tested numerous burn pits in southern Marja for human remains, but did not find any evidence of a corpse. Photographs of several of the pits appear in documents released to The Post. Investigators appeared at Swenson’s home in Seattle in May 2012, looking for information about Golsteyn. Swenson’s name is redacted from the documents, but the incident was outlined February in an article by the Daily Beast. Swenson eventually wrote a letter in support of Golsteyn that was circulated around Capitol Hill. He noted that he had completed training with Golsteyn early in their careers and would “gladly stand with him on any battlefield against enemy.” [For Medal of Honor recipient William Swenson, a rocky path to the White House] The Army’s handling of Golsteyn’s case has come under heavy criticism from Rep. Duncan D. Hunter Jr. (R.Calif.), a Marine veteran and frequent critic of the Army secretary. Hunter has repeatedly questioned why the Army stripped Golsteyn of awards and moved more recently to remove him from the service. A board of higher-ranking officers will determine Golsteyn’s future in an administrative hearing tentatively scheduled for next week, although his lawyer said it could be moved to June due to a scheduling conflict. McHugh has stood by his decisions, saying in a letter in February that Golsteyn had “demonstrated a lack of honorable conduct.” Although no charges were filed, investigators found that there was probable cause that Golsteyn “committed the offenses of Murder, Conspiracy and War Crimes, when he conspired with multiple Special Forces team members to commit premeditated murder and desecration of the body afterwards.” Army Criminal Investigation Command defended its actions and conclusions. “Findings of our investigations are thoroughly reviewed by legal authorities,” said a spokesman, Chris Grey. “We stand by the investigative findings of our agents. Due to the upcoming proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.” Ashley Johnson, the older sister of Larry Johnson, one of the Marines killed, expressed dismay with the way the military has treated Golsteyn. She has never met the Army officer once in charge of her brother in Afghanistan, but she would like to someday, she said. “He, from what I read, is a hero and did what he had to do. I believe at a time like that, you wear your heart on your sleeve and I think it’s what anyone with a heart would do,” she said. Johnson added that the suspected insurgent Golsteyn is accused of killing “was the enemy that he believed killed his Marines. “It brings a tear to my eye to know he cared so much,” she said. “He deserves his medals for everything he went through.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the year in which Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. It was in 2002, not 2006.	702	26	680	2023-04-24T20:57:28.638593Z	2023-04-24T20:57:28.638711Z	969.02	"[{""start"": 702, ""end"": 884, ""text"": ""According to Army documents, the young officer disclosed to CIA personnel during a 2011 job interview that he had killed an unarmed Taliban fighter he suspected of being a bombmaker."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 885, ""end"": 1093, ""text"": ""The documents, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, also suggest an elaborate cover-up that, if true, could amount to serious war crimes involving not only Golsteyn but fellow Green Beret soldiers"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6019, ""end"": 6432, ""text"": ""According to the documents, Golsteyn recalled to CIA interviewers that he and one other unidentified U.S. soldier took the suspected bombmaker off the base, shot him to death and buried his remains in a shallow grave.

President Trump tweeted Sunday that he will review the case of a former Special Forces officer and Afghanistan war veteran who was notified last week that he will face a murder charge in the death of a detainee suspected of being a Taliban bombmaker. Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn was notified Thursday by the Army that he will face one charge of murder, his attorney and the Army said. The military has been investigating him since 2011, when Army officials said he confessed during a polygraph test as part of a CIA job interview to killing the suspected bombmaker in February 2010. “At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a ‘U.S. Military hero,’ Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder,” Trump tweeted. “He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas.” It wasn’t clear Sunday what Trump’s “review” could comprise or whether he is considering pardoning Golsteyn if the Army convicts him of murder. The White House did not respond to questions seeking clarity on the president’s Twitter post. The case remains under investigation, with an Article 32 hearing expected next year to review evidence. An Army spokesman, Lt. Col. Loren Bymer, said Golsteyn was recalled to active duty last week to face the charge. Trump’s statement alone could complicate the military’s prosecution of Golsteyn. The president, as commander in chief, is expected in the military justice system to not make statements that could influence open cases. Doing so is considered unlawful command influence and can result in cases being thrown out. A Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Rob Manning, said Sunday that the allegations against Golsteyn are a “law enforcement matter,” and that the Defense Department will “respect the integrity of this process and provide updates when appropriate.” Golsteyn’s attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, has disputed that Golsteyn’s statement to the CIA was characterized accurately by the Army. The service launched an investigation into Golsteyn after the CIA alerted them to his job interview but closed it without charging him. The case was reopened in 2016, after Golsteyn said during a Fox News interview that he had killed a bombmaker, who had been held as a detainee, out of fear that the bombmaker would target Afghans helping U.S. troops if he were let go. Golsteyn, a 2002 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., was lauded for his performance in Afghanistan as the commander of a team from 3rd Special Forces Group in the Battle of Marja. About 15,000 coalition troops fought to take back a poppy-laden section of Helmand province that was controlled by the Taliban and laced with explosives. On Feb. 20, 2010, Golsteyn coordinated numerous airstrikes and repeatedly braved enemy fire after launching a mission to kill a Taliban sniper who nearly hit a nearby Marine, according to a military summary of his actions. He was later awarded the Silver Star for valor, and the Army was considering upgrading the award to the Distinguished Service Cross — one step down from the Medal of Honor — when the allegations against Golsteyn emerged. The accusations center on actions that occurred two days earlier. Two Marines — Sgt. Jeremy R. McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19 — were killed, and others were wounded by a garage door that was booby trapped with explosives, prompting a search of nearby homes in which Golsteyn’s unit found bombmaking materials and a suspected bombmaker, according to the results of an investigation released to The Washington Post through the Freedom of Information Act in 2015. Golsteyn later recounted during his CIA job interview that the U.S. troops detained the man and brought him back to their base. While detained, the suspected bombmaker unexpectedly crossed paths with an Afghan tribal leader with whom Golsteyn’s team was working. When the leader expressed fear for his life, Golsteyn said, he grew concerned about the consequences of letting the suspected bombmaker go, according to Army documents. “CPT Golsteyn related there had been countless times when he detained someone and sent that person to a detention facility only to see that same person shooting at his unit weeks later,” an Army investigator’s summary of Golsteyn’s polygraph test said. “CPT Golsteyn stated he had no qualms about what he did because he couldn’t have lived with himself if [the suspected bombmaker] killed another Soldier or Marine.” The Army dropped Golsteyn from the Special Forces and stripped him of the Silver Star. The service accused him in a June 2015 administrative hearing of violating the law of armed conflict, but a panel of officers determined that was unsubstantiated. It instead recommended separating him from the military for conduct unbecoming an officer with a general discharge under honorable conditions.

"President Trump could soon intervene in at least one of several cases in which U.S. service members have been accused of war crimes, according to people involved in the process, despite concern among some Pentagon leaders that such action could damage military discipline and morale. Families and attorneys for the accused saw the Veterans Day weekend as a possible window for Trump to issue pardons or help in other ways. The president has not spoken publicly about the cases in recent days but has questioned whether the service members were treated fairly and believes he has support among his political base to act, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “The president doesn’t seem to be constrained by any sort of timeline for these decisions, which contributes to higher intrigue and reasserts his prerogative as commander in chief,"" said one U.S. official with knowledge of ongoing conversations. Defense Secretary Mark. T. Esper discussed the issue with Trump last week, the official said, but it was something of a “courtesy” in which Esper likely “rehashed all the things [the president] expected to hear."" Trump has expressed an interest in pardoning service members accused of crimes, especially after the cases have been discussed on television, one former senior administration official said. In May, Trump pardoned former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted in the 2008 murder of an Iraqi prisoner suspected member of al-Qaeda. The discussion was renewed on Nov. 4 when Fox News personality Pete Hegseth announced that Trump was interested in taking action in the cases by Veterans Day. Trump is know to speak regularly with Hegseth. Alyssa Farah, a Pentagon spokeswoman, referred The Post to Esper’s previous comments on the issue. The Pentagon chief acknowledged last week that he had discussed the issue with Trump but declined to say whether he supports exonerating the service members involved. “But I do have full confidence in the military justice system and we’ll let things play out as they play out,” Esper added. “I offered ― as I do in all matters ― the facts, the options, my advice, the recommendations and we’ll see how things play out."" The cases include that of Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, a former Special Forces officer who faces a murder trial in the death of a suspected Taliban bomb maker; former Special Warfare Operator Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who recently was acquitted of the most serious charges against him but convicted of a lesser war crime; and former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2013 and is serving a 19-year prison sentence for ordering his soldiers to open fire on three men in Afghanistan. Trump could act next in the case of Lorance, who lost his case after nine members of his unit testified against him. Lorance’s relatives traveled to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas from several states this week in anticipation that Trump could set him free, said David Gurfein, a retired Marine who is assisting the family as the chief executive officer of United American Patriots, a nonprofit that raises money to help people charged with war crimes. Lorance’s supporters have argued that Army prosecutors in his case hid details, including that biometrics showed the men were affiliated with the Taliban. The U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in 2017 that the information would not have been permitted at a new trial. Gurfein said he is “very optimistic” Lorance could be released soon, though the details for how that would occur are not clear. An announcement could come Wednesday, Gurfein said, citing conversations with people who are “closest to the president.” Gurfein said he also anticipates action in Golsteyn’s case soon, but a defense official said that is not clear, especially considering how different the facts of the cases are. The options available to the president in Lorance’s case include granting a full pardon, shortening his prison sentence or disagreeing with previous findings in the case. Golsteyn’s case, involving the 2010 death of a man in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province, has been at the center of an Army investigation for years. The incident came under scrutiny in 2011 after he applied for a job with the CIA and disclosed during a polygraph test that he had killed someone on deployment and burned the body, according to Army documents and a previous interview with Golsteyn. The Army closed the case without bringing charges against him in 2013, electing to punish him administratively instead, revoking his Special Forces tab and taking away a Silver Star awarded for valor. But, citing undisclosed new evidence, the service re-opened the case and brought a murder charge against him in late 2018, prompting Trump to tweet on two occasions that he would review the case. A court-martial is scheduled for next year. “The case of Major Mathew Golsteyn is now under review at the White House,” Trump tweeted in October, tagging Hegseth in the post. “Mathew is a highly decorated Green Beret who is being tried for killing a Taliban bombmaker. We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!” Golsteyn has acknowledged killing the man but said the incident occurred during a lawful ambush after he was detained and released. In a statement released Monday night, Golsteyn said he is “incredibly grateful” for Trump’s attention on the case and that Esper’s intervention over the last week has raised new questions about fairness. “I am glad that the absence of impartiality in the military justice system is being exposed on a national scale so that it can be remedied, but saddened at the same time over the clear lack of moral courage in our senior leaders in DOD,” he said. In Gallagher’s case, a murder trial against him fell apart in June after another SEAL in his unit testified in court that he had actually killed a wounded Islamic State detainee in Iraq at the center of the case. Gallagher was convicted instead of taking a photograph with an Islamic State corpse and demoted him one rank to petty officer first class. Gallagher is seeking to have his old rank reinstated before he retires, said his attorney, Tim Parlatore. Gallagher appeared on a Fox News segment with Hegseth over Veterans Day weekend, but his attorney said he is not speaking with the White House or trying to influence Trump. Rachel VanLandingham, a military justice expert at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles, said that Trump has the right to taken action in the cases as commander in chief. But she argued that doing so will have consequences, and that acting in Golsteyn’s case before it is tried would undermine commanders. “No president in my knowledge since the enactment in 1950 of the [Uniform Code of Military Justice] has so interfered in an ongoing court-martial with its panoply of due-process safeguards,” she said. “What Trump is doing is the opposite of due process — it’s tyrannical.” Josh Dawsey contributed to this report."	700	26	678	2023-04-24T20:34:38.950545Z	2023-04-24T20:34:38.950611Z	5691.728	"[{""start"": 2238, ""end"": 2570, ""text"": ""The cases include that of Army Maj.

Judges in the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Court on Thursday authorized Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to open an investigation into alleged U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan. This is a big milestone in international criminal justice — for the first time in history, U.S. leaders, armed forces and intelligence personnel may face a trial in an international court for crimes perpetrated in the context of the nation’s wars abroad. In April, the Pre-Trial Chamber rejected Bensouda’s first request for an investigation. On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the Appeals Chamber’s overturning of the decision, calling the ICC “an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body.” What are the alleged abuses? How does the ICC have jurisdiction over the United States? What will ordinary U.S. citizens make of an ICC investigation? My research explains how U.S. citizens are more supportive of the ICC than the Trump administration’s rhetoric suggests. In 2006, the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) opened a preliminary examination into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Afghan conflict since 2003 — the year Afghanistan became a member of the ICC. The OTP examined allegations of abuses by both anti-government and pro-government forces, including the Taliban, the Afghan National Security Forces, the United States, armed forces and the CIA. The OTP says the information it gathered indicates, among other allegations, that U.S. interrogation techniques used in Afghanistan — involving “torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape” — amount to war crimes. The United States is not a member of the ICC. However, the treaty that created the court, the Rome Statute, allows it to investigate citizens of nonmember states if the alleged crimes occurred on the territory of a member state. Once Afghanistan ratified the Rome Statute and joined the ICC in 2003, U.S. military and intelligence personnel in Afghanistan came under the court’s jurisdiction. In November 2017 — after more than a decade of gathering evidence — the prosecutor requested authorization to open a full investigation, arguing there was “a reasonable basis to believe” U.S. military and intelligence personnel committed war crimes. A year and a half later, in April 2019, the Pre-Trial Chamber unanimously rejected the request. The judges agreed the request was in the ICC’s jurisdiction and admissible before the ICC. However, they claimed the investigation would probably not be successful and, therefore, it would not serve the interests of justice to proceed. The 2019 decision sparked controversy in the human rights community. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch issued statements criticizing the court’s judges for capitulating to the Trump administration’s threats and, in the process, abandoning the victims of the alleged crimes. Bensouda swiftly appealed the decision. Her office coordinated a multifaceted response, drawing on submissions from victims’ legal representatives and amicus curiae briefs from human rights organizations. On Thursday, the Appeals Chamber unanimously reversed the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision, saying it had gone beyond its power by rejecting the prosecutor’s request. The Rome Statute requires only that the Pre-Trial Chamber determine whether “there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation” and whether “the case appears to fall within the jurisdiction of the Court.” Since these facts were not in dispute, there was no basis to reject the prosecutor’s request. Last week’s decision authorizes Bensouda and her team to proceed with the investigation. The Appeals Chamber also granted permission for the prosecutor and her team to investigate allegations of abuses that related to the conflict in Afghanistan but that occurred outside the territory strictly defined — notably in CIA “black site” detention facilities in Poland, Romania and Lithuania. Pompeo stated in a news briefing Thursday that “we’re going to take all the appropriate actions to ensure that American citizens are not hauled before this political body to settle a political vendetta.” It is not yet clear what these actions will involve, but it seems unlikely the Trump administration will support the ICC investigation. The Trump administration has long been hostile toward the ICC. President Trump’s statement from last April criticized the court’s “broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; [and] the threat it poses to American national sovereignty.” The administration has also shown its disapproval of the ICC by revoking U.S. visas for ICC personnel and threatening financial sanctions against ICC judges and prosecutors. However, obstructing the ICC may be less popular with the U.S. public than one might think. My survey findings, detailed last April in the Monkey Cage, reveal the U.S. public is not hostile to the ICC. In an article recently published in the International Studies Quarterly, I find the majority of Americans (56 percent) support the ICC and actually believe the United States should become a member. This number grows to 65 percent when Americans are told about how the court is a vehicle for promoting democratic values, such as accountability and human rights. My research indicates that unlike the administration, ordinary citizens are more concerned about the ICC’s fairness and competence — and less concerned about whether U.S. personnel may be investigated. If Bensouda and her team can demonstrate impartiality and effectiveness in their work, they are likely to enjoy the trust and support of the U.S. public. In turn, this support might put pressure on policymakers to comply with the ICC investigation in the weeks, months and very likely years to come. Don’t miss anything!

On May 6, the White House announced that President Trump had granted clemency to Michael Behenna, a former Army lieutenant convicted of murder. That’s effectively a full pardon for Behenna, sentenced to 25 years in prison for taking Ali Mansur, a suspected bombmaker, for an unsanctioned interrogation in 2008 — and then shooting Mansur in what he claimed was self-defense. The White House cited “broad support from the military.” As evidence, it pointed to the fact that 37 retired generals and admirals, many with senior overseas command experience, had signed a 2013 amici curiae to the Supreme Court asking the justices to review the law of combat self-defense in this case. Does any of this erode the military’s independence from politics, a stance that’s a key feature of a healthy democracy? Both the White House’s influence on military justice and ex-military officers’ involvement in politics could have repercussions for the military’s credibility and effectiveness. Here are four takeaways from recent events. 1. Presidents’ intervention in military justice has been controversial before President Barack Obama was — and still is — criticized for in 2017 commuting the sentence of former Army soldier Chelsea Manning, convicted of leaking classified material to WikiLeaks in 2013. Several senior Democrats denounced the pardon at the time; as Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) put it, the issue was “what message do we send” to others who might consider the same. In similar ways, observers such as civil-military scholar Jason Dempsey criticize Trump’s pardon of Behenna as potentially undermining the military’s ethical code against atrocities — since the killing occurred during an unsanctioned interrogation after Mansur had been released. And the ACLU charges that the pardon implicitly sanctions war crimes. 2. But Trump’s intervention is consistent with his record in similar cases Under military law, commanders are enjoined from any behavior that might influence ongoing military judicial proceedings, including giving opinions about how they should be decided. So is the president — as commander in chief — subject to this restriction over “undue command influence”? Legal scholars are debating that — because Trump has been commenting on, and influencing, ongoing trials. For instance, then-candidate Trump denounced former Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl for leaving his post in Afghanistan in 2009, after which Bergdahl spent nearly five years captured by the Taliban. After Trump took office, Bergdahl’s defense team argued that a fair trial was no longer possible, given the president’s damaging rhetoric. Or consider the cases of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher and Army Special Forces Officer Matt Golsteyn. Gallagher is awaiting trial on charges that, without authorization or combat justification, he killed a prisoner in Iraq — and then held his reenlistment ceremony with the victim’s corpse. This March, Trump tweeted that Gallagher would be moved to “less restrictive confinement” in honor of his service to his country. And Golsteyn was investigated by the Army for the unsanctioned killing of an unarmed Taliban fighter in 2010, an investigation that was reopened when Golsteyn admitted to the killing on Fox News in 2016. In December, Trump tweeted that Golsteyn was a “U.S. Military hero” whose case he would be “reviewing.” That concerns legal scholars. Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Rachel VanLandingham told the military affairs site “Task &amp; Purpose” that such interventions damage the military justice system’s credibility, arguing, “The more Trump meddles, the more he undermines that system as being impartial and fair.” 3. Don’t expect this to change public opinion of the military Even if civil-military and legal scholars debate the pardon decision, don’t expect it to damage public opinion of the military. Polls regularly find that Americans rank the military as the most trusted institution in U.S. society. And Republicans especially favor the armed forces, as my own research finds. Here’s how I did my research. In 2017, I conducted a survey experiment on a nationally representative panel of 1,000 YouGov respondents. Survey respondents read negative news stories on different types of military institutional misconduct, including war crimes, organizational scandals and battlefield missteps. When compared to a control group that had read unrelated stories, Democrats and independents who read these accounts registered significantly lower levels of confidence in the military as an institution. However, Republicans’ impressions of the military remained steadily high. In some cases, these partisans expressed higher confidence in the military than those who did not read these accounts — as if “doubling down” to defend a favored institution. Further, that group was less likely overall to receive such negative information given media consumption habits. My findings are consistent with other surveys over recent years. But if many Americans do not find the pardon problematic, it probably is because the public may be unmoved by the underlying misconduct. In a 2016 Reuters-Ipsos survey, a majority supported the use of torture on suspected terrorists, although Republicans (82 percent) did so far more than Democrats (53 percent). In other words, a sizable proportion of the electorate is unlikely to lower its opinion of the military, and another constituency may actively defend it. 4. The retired military elite got engaged — in a different way Defense leaders have continued to express frustration that, increasingly, former military officers are becoming politically active. For instance, during the 2016 presidential election, retired generals made appearances at both major party conventions. Ex-military voices have only gotten louder since Trump took office, denouncing administration policy on issues that include climate security, torture, LGBT rights, security clearances and relations with the media. The services are trying to curb this advocacy. The 37 retired officers who signed the Behenna amicus brief aimed to influence the Supreme Court on a relatively minor point. That the White House appealed to that brief in justifying this pardon suggests both that retired military officers can influence political decision-making — and also that the military’s brand can be used for political purposes. Many scholars believe that having a nonpartisan military is one hallmark of a functioning democracy. Will these events — both the president’s attempt to sway the course of military justice, and ex-military officers’ attempt to influence politics — tarnish that?

President Trump has signed an executive order authorizing new sanctions against prosecutors and officials of the International Criminal Court after the body approved investigations of alleged war crimes by U.S. service members and intelligence officers in Afghanistan. In an unprecedented display of administration firepower, the secretaries of state and defense, along with the attorney general and the national security adviser, jointly announced sanctions against officials of what they called a “corrupt” and “politically motivated” court manipulated by Russia and other U.S. adversaries. The announcement escalates a long-standing dispute with the Netherlands-based court, established 18 years ago under the Treaty of Rome. The United States has never ratified the treaty or recognized the court’s jurisdiction. The Trump administration has taken a particularly tough stand against what it calls the court’s attempts to violate U.S. sovereignty and pose a national security threat. In 2018, when he was national security adviser, John Bolton vowed that the United States would not cooperate with the court and declared, “For all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us.” The measures announced Thursday include economic sanctions against any ICC officials involved in efforts to investigate “allied personnel without that ally’s consent” and an extension to family members of visa restrictions already in effect against those officials. “Imagine an American soldier, sailor, airman, Marine or an intelligence officer is on leave with his or her family, maybe on a beach in Europe,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a brief appearance with the others at the State Department. “And over the course of two decades or more, this soldier honorably defended America in Anbar province, in Kandahar, taking down terrorists. Then, suddenly, that vacation turns into a nightmare.” “We cannot, we will not stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court,” he added. Standing at his side, Defense Secretary Mike T. Esper said, “We will not allow American citizens who have served our country to be subjected to illegitimate investigations.” The U.S. military and civilian justice systems are fully capable of taking “appropriate action” against alleged misconduct, including “alleged abuse of detainees or any other misconduct,” Esper said. Pompeo also called a proposed ICC investigation of Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip a “mockery of justice.” The ICC is designed as a court of last resort, used only after countries are unable or unwilling to take action against their own citizens accused of war crimes. The United States has prosecuted troops for criminal conduct committed during the war in Afghanistan. Human rights groups have complained the numbers are relatively small and have not included high-level officers and U.S. officials who may have issued orders. Trump has intervened in several cases involving war-crimes accusations despite opposition from military justice experts and some senior Pentagon officials. The ICC investigation will not focus solely on allegations against U.S. troops. Lead prosecutor Fatou Bensouda wants to investigate possible crimes committed by the Taliban and other groups between 2003 and 2014, including alleged mass killings of civilians, as well as the alleged torture of prisoners by Afghan authorities and, to a lesser degree, by U.S. forces and the CIA. Attorney General William P. Barr said a March decision by the court to authorize the investigation of U.S. operations in Afghanistan “validates long-standing concerns” that the ICC is “little more than a political tool employed by unaccountable international elites . . . to manipulate and undercut the foreign policy” of the United States and its allies. Barr said the Justice Department has launched its own investigation of “a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor of the ICC,” including information that “may well have a bearing on current investigations” by the court. Human rights groups expressed concerns that the executive order was overly broad and vague and could put human rights researchers at risk in countries allied with the United States, such as the Philippines. “This is yet another instance of the Trump administration taking action that will alienate many of America’s closest allies while contributing to an atmosphere of impunity for the world’s worst human rights abusers,” said Rob Berschinski, vice president for policy at Human Rights First. Daniel Balson, advocacy director for Amnesty International USA, said the United States could achieve more by working to change multilateral institutions rather than attacking them. “The administration has done nothing in that realm,” he said. All the speakers at the State Department on Thursday, including White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien, noted that successive administrations have never recognized the court and said that U.S. citizens are not subject to its jurisdiction. The officials finished their remarks and abruptly left the room, taking no questions from reporters assembled for the announcement.	696	26	674	2023-04-21T07:28:01.987996Z	2023-04-21T07:28:01.988069Z	322.693	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 267, ""text"": ""nt Trump has signed an executive order authorizing new sanctions against prosecutors and officials of the International Criminal Court after the body approved investigations of alleged war crimes by U.S. service members and intelligence officers in Afghanistan"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3151, ""end"": 3447, ""text"": ""Lead prosecutor Fatou Bensouda wants to investigate possible crimes committed by the Taliban and other groups between 2003 and 2014, including alleged mass killings of civilians, as well as the alleged torture of prisoners by Afghan authorities and, to a lesser degree, by U.S. forces and the CIA"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3151, ""end"": 3447, ""text"": ""Lead prosecutor Fatou Bensouda wants to investigate possible crimes committed by the Taliban and other groups between 2003 and 2014, including alleged mass killings of civilians, as well as the alleged torture of prisoners by Afghan authorities and, to a lesser degree, by U.S. forces and the CIA"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
Trump administration officials took a victory lap Friday after the International Criminal Court decided not to proceed with an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, hailing it as vindication of their insistence that the court has no jurisdiction over U.S. forces who might have been implicated in a probe. The judges’ decision appeared to end the quest for accountability for victims of abuses following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. The prosecutor was particularly interested in looking at the alleged abuse of detainees taken in by U.S. forces and the CIA. Although the judges said there was a basis to believe crimes had been committed, a lack of cooperation from the United States, Afghan authorities and the Taliban made the chances of a successful prosecution remote. President Trump called the decision “a major international victory, not only for these patriots, but for the rule of law.” “Any attempt to target American, Israeli or allied personnel for prosecution will be met with a swift and vigorous response,” he added in a statement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who last month said the United States would deny or revoke visas to ICC investigators looking into abuses by U.S. citizens and allies, also characterized it as a victory. “The United States will always protect allied and American military and civilian personnel from living in fear from unjust prosecution for actions taken to defend our great nation,” he said in a statement. National security adviser John Bolton was triumphant, calling it a vindication of his long-standing opposition to the court, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands. The United States signed the Rome Statute creating the court in 2000 during the Clinton administration but never joined, as have 123 other countries. Bolton was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2002 when he “unsigned” the United States from the court’s jurisdiction, an action he has called “my happiest day in government.” “Today is the second happiest day of my life,” he said Friday. The U.S. refusal to cooperate in any investigation by the court was one of the key reasons the judges rejected the 2017 request by chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan. Bensouda said on April 5 that her visa to the United States had been revoked. Bensouda’s request said there was reason to believe that members of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies had “committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations, principally in the 2003-2004 period.” She alleged that the Taliban and other militants had have killed more than 17,000 civilians in the past decade, and Afghan forces have tortured prisoners. Human rights groups said the court’s decision was a capitulation to U.S. threats and bullying. Amnesty International called it “a shocking abandonment of victims.” Human Rights Watch said it dealt “a devastating blow for victims who have suffered grave crimes without redress.” The Trump administration has been openly dismissive of the court’s authority, particularly after the Palestinian Authority tried last year to get the court to build a case against Israel. Bolton has been the most vociferous and scornful. On Friday, he handed reporters copies of a speech he gave to the Federalist Society in September and read aloud his own words: “We will not cooperate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die on his own. For all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us.” Bolton denied that the United States had bullied the court. “I don’t think it’s bullying to stand up to protect innocent American service members, members of the intelligence community who are unjustly accused,” he said. “When Americans violate their training and doctrine, whether they’re in the military or in the intelligence community, as a democratic, constitutional society we are capable of holding our own citizens accountable.” carol.morello@washpost.com	695	26	673	2023-04-20T16:15:44.338404Z	2023-04-20T16:15:44.338601Z	72.388	"[{""start"": 2041, ""end"": 2687, ""text"": ""The U.S. refusal to cooperate in any investigation by the court was one of the key reasons the judges rejected the 2017 request by chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan.

On Friday, the White House announced that President Trump would issue executive grants of clemency — full pardons — to former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance and Maj. Matt Golsteyn. The order releases Lorance, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for ordering his platoon to open fire on unarmed men in Afghanistan. It prevents the trial of Golsteyn, accused of the 2010 extrajudicial killing of a suspected bombmaker. The White House’s statement also ordered the preretirement promotion of former Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who was recently acquitted of murder charges for two separate incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the issuing of pardons is undoubtedly within the constitutional authority of the presidency, the recent decisions have sparked a contentious debate in military affairs and national security discussion circles. What does this mean for civil-military relations, the public’s opinion of the military as an institution, and U.S. domestic politics? Here are some takeaways from these recent events. Presidential interventions in military justice matters seldom avoid controversy. While the power to offer pardons rests with the Oval Office, presidents have generally supported the decisions of the military justice system. However, as veteran and former defense official Phillip Carter remarks, the recent pardon decisions are uniquely challenging to the military’s attempts to “lay the ghosts of the Vietnam War” to rest. These ghosts have lingered since President Nixon’s intervention on behalf of William Calley, architect of the infamous 1968 My Lai Massacre in which a small hamlet in Vietnam was the scene for some of that conflict’s worst atrocities. As many national security analysts and military veterans have noted, such pardons risk implicitly signaling that such actions are organizationally acceptable behavior. Similar concerns were expressed after the May pardoning of former Army officer Michael Behenna, convicted of similar misconduct during a 2008 deployment in Iraq. However, advocates for the pardons argue that military service members have been unduly constrained by organizational policies governing combat action. The resulting debate has drawn in a variety of voices on both sides. The pardons for Golsteyn and Lorance come at the end of several years of advocacy from prominent ex-military members of Congress and media personalities. The White House’s statement specifically mentioned Marine veteran and Rep. Duncan D. Hunter and former Army officer and “Fox and Friends” pundit Pete Hegseth. The list of past advocates for a pardon also includes ex-Navy SEAL and former interior secretary Ryan Zinke and retired Army lieutenant colonel and former congressman Allen West, who himself was relieved of command in Iraq and after his improper treatment of a detainee. But if ex-military voices featured prominently in the case for the pardons, they have also loudly denounced it. The announcement by the White House was roundly condemned by retired Army Gen. Mark Hertling and retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis. A statement by retired Marine commandant Charles Krulak (which itself invoked past statements by Sen. John McCain and Gen. Martin Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs) decried the measure as “relinquish[ing] the United States’ moral high ground.” The presence of so many ex-military voices in the political debate highlights worries amid national security scholars regarding the potential politicization of the military. It also shows the relevance of a larger discussion about maintaining proper operation of U.S. civil-military relations. The president carries sole authority for the issuing of executive clemencies. Statements by both the Army and Navy took particular care to make that explicit in their response to the pardon decisions. But the decision itself, made over the objections of senior defense officials, is the latest of several stories detailing the challenges that divergent worldviews and ethical frames have had on U.S. civil-military relations. More specifically, the decisions place the military institution in a potentially difficult position, as civil-military relations scholar Steve Saideman noted after the Behenna decision in May. By staying out of the discussion, the military risks being seen as implicitly approving the behavior of the soldiers in question; by engaging directly in it, they risk violating dearly held norms governing civilian control of the process. But there is important utility to an ethically grounded fighting force: not simply to maintain the “high ground” morally, but as Dempsey remarked, failure to do so “signals our troops and allies that we don’t take the Law of Armed Conflict seriously.” As many scholars will attest, a central feature of strong democratic governance is a military that is structurally subordinated to civilian control and avowedly nonpartisan. However, the outcry by many over the recent pardon decisions undoubtedly raises questions over precedent in organizational ethics and, as Army lawyer and legal scholar Dan Maurer has noted, about the nature of judicial independence within the military itself. The decisions don’t just affect the functioning of civil-military affairs. They have potentially significant political implications as well. Republican lawmakers and conservative media personalities such as Hegseth have played an important role in advocating for the pardons. This may speak to the larger political benefits at stake as a critical election year begins. Furthermore, perceived benefits among the Republican base may be part of the reason for the decision. In a 2017 survey experiment as part of my own research, I measured partisan reactions among a nationally representative sample of 1,000 U.S. respondents, gathered through an online propensity-score matched panel from the survey firm YouGov. The respondents were exposed to various types of negative institutional behavior by the military, rooted in actual news stories, and I compared their expressions of trust in the military institution with a control group that received placebo information. While independents were mostly perturbed by battlefield failures or mistakes, Democrats found organizational scandals or ethics violations the most problematic. Republicans, on the other hand, were unmoved by any new information about failures or mistakes by the military. These results point to a widening partisan gap over public judgments about the military, which though the most esteemed institution in U.S. society, is far more trusted by Republicans than other demographics. The pardons effectively end the procedural discussion over the legal fate of these former soldiers. It is unlikely that the larger debate over military politicization, organizational ethics and civil-military relations will end any time soon. Michael A.

Late last week, President Trump pardoned two service members and reversed the demotion of a third, each of whom was accused of war crimes. The details of the crimes were different, but the cases shared a common theme: The men were accused of killing civilians or prisoners outside the zone of combat, in violation of the laws of war. The pardons, made over the objections of the Pentagon, suggest that Trump holds a dangerous, obsolete view of warfare — one that had fallen into disrepute after the horrors of World War II. His actions suggest that he believes in “total war,” in which warfare is conducted not only by professional soldiers but also by entire societies, including their civilians. The slaughter of the 1940s, in which civilians bore the brunt of much military force, notably through aerial bombings, led nations to recommit themselves to vigorous enforcement of rules on the conduct of war — rules that drew sharp distinctions between combatants and noncombatants, protecting the latter. The goal was to avoid total war at all costs and to ensure that professional soldiers bore the brunt of war’s horror. Trump apparently rejects the combatant-noncombatant distinction as a pointless quibble. Yet such a stance could have dangerous implications, including for both U.S. soldiers and American civilians. Through the 19th and early 20th centuries, war had been moving steadily in the direction of total war. For example, during the Napoleonic Wars in the early 1800s, militaries used strategies designed to demoralize civilians so they would pressure their leaders for peace. Cities were burned, food sources destroyed. World War I was no better. When the Germans invaded Belgium in 1914, they massacred civilians and looted the town of Louvain. The rest of the continent suffered a refugee crisis as millions of civilians on both sides were displaced during the fighting. The logical culmination of total war came in World War II with the Holocaust, the strategic bombing of cities as a tactic of demoralization, and the dropping of the atomic bomb. The rules codified after World War II, however, harked to codes that first rose to prominence during the medieval period. Under “chivalric” codes, warfare was conducted by knights who engaged in battle with one another according to customs or norms of honor. It was considered dishonorable to fight people outside of the circle of those designated to bear arms. After World War II, the chivalric notion of warfare came to be embodied in international treaties like the Geneva Conventions and domestic statutes like the Uniform Code of Military Justice — which formed the basis for the prosecutions in the three cases into which the president inserted himself. These laws ensure that the burdens of war fall almost exclusively on professional soldiers, who are granted legal immunity to kill enemy soldiers; in turn, they open themselves up to the reciprocal risk of getting killed by the enemy. Trump’s pardons each involved alleged crimes committed by U.S. soldiers against individuals hors de combat, a technical legal term meaning individuals who are “outside” of combat. Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn was charged with murder in the killing of a suspected Taliban bombmaker, known as Rasoul, who was in the process of being released from U.S. custody in Afghanistan in 2010. Golsteyn was initially reprimanded but not charged by the military, but during a later job interview with the CIA, Golsteyn admitted that he had executed the man and burned the body, which caused the military to reopen its investigation. Golsteyn was scheduled to be tried in February. Former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance was convicted in 2013 on two counts of murder for ordering his platoon to open fire on civilians riding a motorcycle in Afghanistan. Members of his platoon testified that the victims did not pose a danger to the platoon, and that Lorance had “repeatedly” targeted unarmed civilians, according to the New York Times. Lorance received 20 years in prison. Former Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher was charged with killing a wounded Islamic State detainee who was being treated by a U.S. medic. Gallagher was accused of executing the prisoner with a knife, although at trial the medic dramatically changed his story and claimed to have killed the prisoner himself, by placing his finger on the man’s breathing tube after the knife injury. Gallagher was acquitted of murder but convicted of posing with the corpse for a photograph, and he received a demotion. Trump reversed the demotion. Such acts violate the core feature of the “war convention” (as the philosopher Michael Walzer has called it) that evolved out of the chivalric notion of combat: namely, the prohibition on harming civilians and soldiers who are either prisoners of war or wounded and therefore incapable of fighting back. (Civilians can be killed as collateral damage — an exception that can be abused but remains important. To be lawful, the death of civilians must be ancillary to the main goal of attacking soldiers, and unavoidable if that goal is to be achieved.) The man Golsteyn is alleged to have killed had just been released from custody; Lorance’s victims were civilians who, according to the military, had taken no part in combat at all; Gallagher’s victim was grievously injured. All were shielded from military attack under the laws of war. The chivalric notion of warfare does bring with it some negative consequences. Soldiers are given little legal protection, at least while they are fighting, and can be killed in large numbers. These rules of war do not yet create any protections for soldiers who are technologically outmatched, and slaughtered as a result, or unwillingly conscripted into service. And some scholars, such as historian Samuel Moyn, have argued in good faith that our collective obsession with “humane” warfare has crowded out legal prohibitions against starting wars in the first place, ultimately leading to more casualties in the long run. You would think it would be the professional military that would have the greatest misgivings about the chivalric code, since the military bears the greatest burdens under its rules. But the truth is just the opposite. In the three cases in which Trump granted pardons, military (not civilian) prosecutors worked hard to investigate and prosecute their own service members. Platoon members horrified by conduct they witnessed testified against the defendants. The White House styled the pardons as an exercise in mercy: a form of sovereign grace that has inspired Trump to issue many pardons over the past three years. (The White House said in a statement that the president is “ultimately responsible that the law is enforced, and when appropriate, that mercy is granted.”) But by issuing the pardons, Trump appears to have rejected the chivalric code of warfare and embraced an ethos of total war without legal restrictions. The Pentagon recognizes that maintaining unit discipline, respect for rules of engagement and compliance with the law of war is important for protecting the United States. If the chivalric code breaks down and legal restrictions evaporate, there will be no grounds for objection when U.S. service members and civilians fall victim to unrestrained killing and brutality. In total war, civilians on both sides always lose.	693	26	671	2023-04-20T15:42:04.569771Z	2023-04-20T15:42:04.569863Z	803.699	"[{""start"": 218, ""end"": 522, ""text"": ""The men were accused of killing civilians or prisoners outside the zone of combat, in violation of the laws of war.

President Trump acknowledged Friday that his consideration of pardons for U.S. service members accused or convicted of war crimes is “a little bit controversial” and suggested he would not be making decisions before Memorial Day. The New York Times reported last week that Trump could issue pardons in some cases around Memorial Day, a holiday meant to remember the United States’ war dead. Speaking to reporters as he prepared to leave the White House en route to Japan, Trump said that he was “looking at a lot of different pardons for a lot of different people.” “Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard, long,” Trump said. “You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight, sometimes they get treated very unfairly. “So we’re going to take a look at it,” he continued. “I haven’t done anything yet. I haven’t made any decisions. There’s two or three of them right now. It’s a little bit controversial.” He added that in cases of those members who’ve yet to stand trial, “it’s very possible that I’ll let the trials go on, and I’ll make my decision after the trial.” In a tweet last year, Trump said that he would review the case of Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, who faces a murder charge in the death of a suspected Taliban bomb maker. Trump also directed the Navy to remove Special Warfare Operator Chief Edward Gallagher from a military brig as he faces a murder charge in the death of an Islamic State detainee. Gallagher is now restricted to his base. The Times reported that other cases believed to be under review include that of a former Blackwater security contractor recently found guilty in the deadly 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis; and that of a group of Marine Corps snipers charged with urinating on the corpses of dead Taliban fighters. Reports that Trump was considering issuing the pardons on Memorial Day has prompted considerable criticism, including a USA Today editorial that said it would be “blasphemy” to do so on “a holiday honoring all that Americans cherish about the sacrifices of those in uniform.” Several of the Democrats seeking to displace Trump in next year’s elections have also spoken out about his reported deliberations, including South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Appearing at a Washington Post Live event on Thursday, Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan as a Navy Reserve intelligence officer, said he thinks it is “disgusting” that Trump is considering using his executive power to issue pardons to war criminals. Buttigieg argued that doing so would undermine the credibility of the U.S. military justice system. “If the president blows a hole in that, he is blowing a hole in the military, and he is putting troops’ lives at risk,” he said. john.wagner@washpost.com	692	26	670	2023-04-20T15:28:38.013798Z	2023-04-20T15:28:38.013918Z	540.789	"[{""start"": 1188, ""end"": 1280, ""text"": ""Mathew L.

Capt. Mathew L. Golsteyn was leading a Special Forces team in Afghanistan in 2010 when an 80-man mission he assembled to hunt insurgent snipers went awry. One of the unit’s five vehicles sank in mud, a gunshot incapacitated an Afghan soldier fighting alongside the Americans, and insurgents maneuvered on them to rake the soggy fields with machine-gun fire. Golsteyn, already a decorated Green Beret officer, responded with calm resolve and braved enemy fire repeatedly that day, according to an Army summary of his actions. He received the Silver Star for valor for his actions during a 2011 ceremony at Fort Bragg, N.C. Top Army officials later approved him for an upgrade to the prestigious Distinguished Service Cross, second only to the Medal of Honor in recognizing combat heroism by U.S. soldiers. In a rare reversal, however, Golsteyn, now a major, no longer has either award. The officer, a former member of the 3rd Special Forces Group and graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., was later investigated for an undisclosed violation of the military’s rules of engagement in combat for killing a known enemy fighter and bomb maker, according to officials familiar with the case. The investigation closed last year without Golsteyn’s being charged with a crime, but Army Secretary John M. McHugh decided not only to deny Golsteyn the Distinguished Service Cross, but also to revoke his Silver Star. McHugh cited a provision in Army regulations that if facts become known that would have prevented the awarding of a medal, the award can be revoked. The Silver Star was approved by a top commander in Afghanistan — Army Gen. David M. Rodriguez, then the three-star deputy commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan — according to Golsteyn’s lawyer, Phil Stackhouse. “I firmly believe that had he known about the derogatory information that was [found] by the aforementioned investigation, he would have never awarded Major Golsteyn the Silver Star,” McHugh said in a Nov. 17 letter to Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R.-Calif.), who has advocated on Golsteyn’s behalf. “Accordingly, I have decided to revoke the interim Silver Star that Major Golsteyn received for this action.” The decision is still shrouded in mystery because of the secretive nature of the Army’s investigation into Golsteyn, who did extensive work with U.S. Marines in and around Marja in Helmand province. An online Defense Department database of top valor awards still included Golsteyn’s Silver Star as of Wednesday afternoon and said the information was current as of Jan. 30. A spokesman for McHugh’s office, Lt. Col. Chris Kasker, declined to comment Wednesday, citing the administrative nature of the decision. But he released details of Golsteyn’s service record that show he no longer has a Silver Star and is is not in Special Forces anymore. The major earned a Bronze Star and Army Commendation medal with “V” devices for heroism in earlier actions, Kasker said. Golsteyn joined the Army in 2002. Hunter, a former Marine officer and veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, alleged in the Daily Beast on Tuesday that the Army “went to extraordinary lengths to investigate Golsteyn,” threatening his fellow soldiers and offering them immunity. In a Dec. 4 letter to Army Human Resources Command, Hunter said the revocation appears to be “retaliatory and vindictive.” “The Army has been unable to present substantive evidence while an overwhelming number of first-person accounts provided to Army investigators uphold Matt’s record as a top-level operator,” said Hunter’s letter, which the congressman’s office released to The Post. Golsteyn’s lawyer said the investigation into the Army officer’s actions was launched in 2011, less than a year after he received the Silver Star. He remains assigned to Army Special Forces Command at Fort Bragg and is in the process of determining what to do with his future, Stackhouse said. The lawyer declined to elaborate on what the Army investigated. “In the summer of 2014, we were certainly under the impression that everything was done and complete,” said Stackhouse. “The revocation of his valor awards came out of left field to us.” The decision also raises the question of whether the military should strip troops of awards they have earned if they are found to have done something wrong later. Golsteyn’s Silver Star came for actions on Feb. 20, 2010. He assembled his unit after his base had come under sniper fire from an insurgent wielding a Dragunov rifle, according to an Army narrative of his actions. He directed his troops to launch an assault across 700 meters of open fields, but an armored truck known as a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle sank into mud under gunfire after about 175 meters. Under heavy machine-gun and sniper fire, Golsteyn ran about 150 meters to the trapped MRAP to retrieve a powerful 84mm Carl Gustav recoilless rifle, an anti-tank weapon. While moving under gunfire, he coordinated a medical evacuation for the wounded Afghan soldier and then opened fire with the Carl Gustav, said the Army narrative, which was obtained by The Post. “Captain Golsteyn was alone running in the open through enemy gun fire that had over 80 men pinned down, and from the crow’s nest on top of [Forward Operating Base] McQueary, it looked like Captain Golsteyn was alone fighting 30 enemy fighters out in the poppy fields,” the award narrative said. Enemy reinforcements continued to arrive on the battlefield, so Golsteyn organized airstrikes by both F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a Predator drone. No American or coalition troops were killed in the battle despite a barrage of enemy fire that lasted four hours, the narrative said. Golsteyn has been critical of the Afghanistan mission in the past. In the 2011 Bing West book “The Wrong War: Grit, Strategy  and the Way Out of Afghanistan,” he is quoted as saying that the Americans were considered insurgents in Afghanistan who were “selling a poor product called the Kabul government.” West later wrote in a review of a book about another Special Forces soldier, Maj. Jim Gant, that the careers of Gant, Golsteyn and a third Green Beret, Dan McKone, were “terminated,” assessing that the Army failed them. West could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Golsteyn wrote about his assignment in Afghanistan in a June 2014 academic paper for a class at Fayetteville State University that was published online. It covers his 2010 deployment and said that his unit — known as a Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha, or A-Team — operated in multiple two- and three-man teams. Over time, local tribesmen grew to trust them, especially after three weeks of fighting, he added. “We enjoyed repeated interactions with the local populace because we lived with them, fighting for them as well as alongside them,” Golsteyn wrote. “In a 60 day period, our medical clinic run by Green Berets with several Marine medics treated approximately 1,000 local Afghans. We executed multiple helicopter casualty evacuations for civilian victims of [improvised explosive devices] in addition to being the first responders to the scene in nearly every case.” This story has been updated with new information about Golsteyn’s current status in the Army.	691	26	669	2023-04-20T15:19:35.028683Z	2023-04-20T15:19:35.028766Z	581.112	"[{""start"": 885, ""end"": 1205, ""text"": ""The officer, a former member of the 3rd Special Forces Group and graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., was later investigated for an undisclosed violation of the military’s rules of engagement in combat for killing a known enemy fighter and bomb maker, according to officials familiar with the case."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
April 2003. Just north of Baghdad. After sleepless hours rolling through the night-vision-green landscape of the Iraqi capital, my scout platoon received a mission: Help secure the Taji military complex. The other platoon leaders and I gathered around the hood of the troop commander’s Humvee to get our orders and then moved out, our Kiowa scout helicopters above us. The adrenaline ran high as my platoon’s six Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicles crashed through the perimeter fence, got into formation and advanced, looking for bad guys. The military is perhaps the only profession where one can spend an entire career preparing to do the job without ever actually doing it. It’s fair to say that most us were spoiling for a fight. As we moved through the complex, stopping to investigate the massive bunkers, mostly empty, I spotted a compact car careering toward my Bradley. I dropped down into the turret. My gunner already had the 25 mm chain gun trained on the vehicle. We were both keyed up, and he repeatedly requested my permission to fire as the car came closer. I felt rushed, but also that I had a little more time to decide whether to fire. Moments later, the car skidded to a halt, most likely having seen the turret tracking its every move. Four or five Iraqis jumped out. My scouts quickly restrained them and sent them for questioning. It turned out they were a father and his sons cutting through the base with perhaps the world’s worst timing. To be clear, I could have fired. The rules of engagement at that time were permissive. I chose not to. And I do not have to carry those deaths with me. I mention this experience not to say that I was an exceptional leader or morally superior. Most people would probably have made the same choice. I mention it because even in the heat of the moment, with adrenaline flowing and some degree of fear, we often do have time to make decisions that safeguard noncombatant lives. This is not the position of President Trump and those who do his bidding. For him, our military professionals are simply “killing machines.” In a White House news release on Nov. 15, Trump said that his recent pardons of war criminals were done in part because “I want to give them the confidence to fight.” In reality, he appears to be giving them the confidence to commit further war crimes because, in his mind, “warfighters” should not be handicapped by the laws of war and ethics. Both on the campaign trail and after his election he expressed approval of (and belief in) an apocryphal story of the murder of prisoners of war by Gen. John J. Pershing after the Spanish-American War. For Trump, supporting the troops means excusing any aberrant behavior as long as it gets the job done. He and the war criminals he has helped elude justice — Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn and Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna ­— are selling a false narrative to the American public that implies these men are being second-guessed for difficult decisions under fire. It’s not the first time a president or others have argued that the Law of Armed Conflict, or LOAC, is outdated and handcuffs the military for no good reason. President Richard Nixon seriously considered pardoning William Calley, perhaps the most infamous of American War criminals, for the murder of 22 civilians in the Vietnamese village of My Lai. He did intervene to make Calley’s incarceration more comfortable. Nixon falsely blamed the Vietnamese civilians when he told his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger: “We know why it was done. These boys being killed by women carrying that stuff in their satchels.” Politicians — Republicans and Democrats — objected to Calley’s conviction in terms strikingly similar to those used today. Rep. Joe Waggonner (D-La.) said: “Lieutenant Calley has been made a scapegoat, and there is no honor in that course. The Army does not know what it is doing.” Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) said, “I am saddened to think that one could fight for his flag and then be court-martialed and convicted for apparently carrying out his orders.” Sen. Robert Taft (R-Ohio) defended Nixon’s actions, saying that he “had to reassure the public and help restore morale in the armed forces.” Even Jimmy Carter, then governor of Georgia, proclaimed American Fighting Man’s Day in support of Calley. Ethical military decision-making is under attack again by both Trump and a public that remains generally uninformed about what ethics under fire actually looks like. The idea of restraint and moral choice even in war is not a new, liberal invention. Some date it as far back as Saint Augustine. Even when not codified by statute, conventions regarding how to fight date back over a thousand years. The murder of English noncombatants and boys in the baggage train, as well as Henry V’s order to murder all French prisoners, remain controversial decisions of the epic 1415 Battle of Agincourt. (Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg presided over a mock trial of Henry V in 2010, and the court, which included Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, found him guilty of war crimes.) But for the U.S. military, the law of war is deadly serious. The branches of service publish field manuals on the topic, the most recent in August. Military lawyers accompany combat units to war to advise commanders on the legality and ethics of their battlefield decisions. In its first chapter, the latest manual quotes Telford Taylor, an American prosecutor at the Nuremburg Trials. He wrote that “unless troops are trained and required to draw the distinction between military and nonmilitary killings, and to retain such respect for the value of life that unnecessary death and destruction will continue to repel them, they may lose the sense of that distinction for the rest of their lives.” The law of war is based on several critical concepts, two of which are most relevant to the criminals Trump pardoned or, in the case of Gallagher, restored to former rank. Proportionality requires that soldiers weigh the destructive potential of the weapons they use against the potential for harm to noncombatants. For example, if a sniper can be eliminated by another sniper, there is no justification for leveling the building with a bombing raid. Often, commanders reserve the right to approve or deny the use of more indiscriminate weapons, such as artillery, for precisely this reason. The second concept concerns the distinction between combatants and noncombatants. The LOAC entitles noncombatants (both uninvolved civilians and fighters who have surrendered) to a wide range of rights, including housing conditions, medical care and humane treatment. Most important, it prevents them from being intentionally targeted (as they were by Lorance, convicted of murder) or killed in cold blood (what Behenna was convicted of and Gallagher and Golsteyn were accused of). Distinguishing friend from foe was certainly easier in past conflicts. Today’s forever wars present combat leaders with incredibly complex battlefields and difficult dilemmas. Some in the Trump camp argue that because our enemies don’t abide by the law of war, we are at a competitive disadvantage. Committing atrocities, in their view, is an unfortunate but necessary consequence of fighting a savage enemy. But military legal authorities have directly addressed this issue. The most recent guidance explicitly states that “DOD policy is to comply with LOAC even when enemy forces are engaged in violations of their LOAC obligations.” As Taylor noted, we obey the law of war in no small part because of what it says about the kind of people we are. Moreover, it is possible to behave morally in the heat of the “unforgiving minute.” Supporters of the Trump war criminals claim that the SEALs and others under fire simply cannot weigh the legality and ethics of their actions. This is untrue. A classic example comes from the SEALs themselves. In Afghanistan in 2005, a small detachment confronted an excruciating choice as it went after a high-value target. Civilian goatherders stumbled across their position. Knowing that if let go, these civilians could endanger the mission, the officer in charge, Lt. Michael Murphy, determined that they were noncombatants and could not simply be killed. He let them go. They appear to have told the enemy. A massive attack followed, resulting in severe American casualties — including Murphy’s death. Yet he made the right ethical and legal decision. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for that combat action. How? Because he had been trained and prepared for that decision. Ethics is a muscle, and it only grows stronger when exercised. Murphy had a history of selfless decision-making and protecting others. Our military operates under the concept of commander’s intent. We tell leaders and subordinates what the overall goal is, so if a leader is killed, the plan does not die with them; anyone can take command and carry on. This applies also to ethical cultures. Leaders like Murphy knew the law and the spirit of that law and could use that intent to guide their decision-making. Abiding by the law of war has both ethical and pragmatic value. Had Murphy’s men made a habit of murdering civilians when they made things inconvenient, it is possible that the lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell, would not have been saved by sympathetic locals. Trump, by dismissing and insulting ethical behavior, sends a clear message that it is not important. This could mean that leaders pay less attention to the training and practice of fighting honorably. My first squadron commander, retired Col. Peter Mansoor, has said as much. He told the Christian Science Monitor that “the laws of warfare are designed not only to protect civilians, but also to minimize the risk of moral injury to troops.” He added that “the military is a lethal business — it’s violent, there’s killing and destruction — and you want to minimize the damage to our values as much as possible, so you don’t go over the edge.” In his unflinching memoir of the Vietnam War, Philip Caputo wrote that the fall into a “brutish state . . . could be checked only by the net of a man’s inner moral values, the attribute called character.” Trump, a man of questionable character, is currently hacking away at that safety net. He is pushing our military over that edge. It is an unpleasant but unavoidable fact that killing other human beings, even in combat, requires some level of dehumanization. Combat leaders exist in part to control that process, to effectively and ethically direct that force against the enemy. They exist, contrary to Hollywood depictions, as managers of violence rather than its practitioners. Yes, leaders pull triggers when they have to, and that ability is necessary for all those who lead in war. But their primary role is to effectively employ their soldiers and equipment to accomplish the mission. A leader constantly staring down the sights of his or her own weapon has become fixated and lacks the perspective to do that, in both a tactical and ethical sense. Trump’s false depiction of his critics as armchair quarterbacks must be confronted. Indeed, many of them have more combat experience than the pardoned men. These war criminals Trump apparently wants to campaign with him did not make life-or-death decisions in the heat of battle. Behenna stripped a freed prisoner naked and shot him. Gallagher allegedly stabbed a wounded prisoner (a noncombatant) and shot civilians in cold blood from a sniper’s perch; a Navy jury convicted him of taking a photo with the stabbing victim’s corpse. Golsteyn marched a captive outside a base, shot him, and hastily “buried his remains in a shallow grave.” Lorance was at least on patrol, but he ordered his men to fire on three unarmed noncombatants on a motorcycle 200 yards from their position with no ability to actually come near them. He then ordered his soldiers to shoot any children who approached the bodies. His own soldiers called his actions “straight murder.” None of these men’s actions came amid the fog of war. None of these men did their best to make sense of a fluid and dangerous situation. Instead, they drank deeply of the intoxicating power over life and death, and abandoned morality for carnage. In almost every situation, their own subordinates reported them or testified against them, actions that should give us hope that our military can withstand the discursive violence the commander in chief is inflicting. Winning is important, but how we win is equally important.	690	26	668	2023-04-20T15:04:18.349681Z	2023-04-20T15:04:37.929445Z	920.632	"[{""start"": 2078, ""end"": 2421, ""text"": ""n a White House news release on Nov. 15, Trump said that his recent pardons of war criminals were done in part because “I want to give them the confidence to fight.” In reality, he appears to be giving them the confidence to commit further war crimes because, in his mind, “warfighters” should not be handicapped by the laws of war and ethics"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 11378, ""end"": 11920, ""text"": ""Behenna stripped a freed prisoner naked and shot him.

In the days since a U.S. gunship opened fire on a Doctor Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, the Pentagon has struggled to explain how 22 people, including patients, staff and three children, wound up killed in the airstrike. Officials have offered murky and contradictory statements on the incident, which Doctors Without Borders has called a war crime. Meanwhile, the top U.S. general in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Campbell has pledged a full investigation into the attack, and the White House has expressed its condolences. Below, a timeline of the Defense Department’s evolving account of what happened. Saturday, Oct. 3:  U.S. forces conducted an airstrike in Kunduz city at 2:15am (local), Oct. 3, against individuals threatening the force.  The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility.  This incident is under investigation. —U.S. Army Col. Brian Tribus, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan Initial reports were extremely murky, with the Pentagon still not sure if it could confirm that a U.S. airstrike in fact had hit the hospital. The use of the military term “collateral damage” immediately inflamed the situation as Doctors Without Borders saw the classification of the strike as a dismissal of the incident. Under the Law of Armed Conflict, collateral damage is legal as long “as it is not excessive in light of the overall military advantage anticipated from the attack.” Sunday, Oct. 4: I think our current understanding, again, understanding that an investigation is going on and early facts can be misleading, is that yes, there was American air action in that area, and that American forces there were engaged in the general vicinity. And at some point in the course of the events there did report that they, themselves, were coming under attack.  That much I think we can safely say. —Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter to reporters while enroute to Spain The day after the attack, with criticism mounting, Carter insisted that U.S. forces were essentially acting in self-defense. The Pentagon would only say that the attack was conducted “in the vicinity” of a Doctors Without Borders medical facility. Monday, Oct. 5:  We have now learned that on October, 3rd, Afghan forces advised that they were taking fire from enemy positions and asked for air support from U.S. Forces. An air strike was then called to eliminate the Taliban threat and several civilians were accidentally struck. —Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Campbell to reporters Campbell appeared to be pointing the finger at Afghan forces for requesting the airstrike, and he said specifically that he was correcting earlier reports that indicated U.S. forces were directly engaged with the enemy when they called in the airstrike. Doctors Without Borders immediately responded to Campbell’s comment. “The reality is the U.S. dropped those bombs,” Christopher Stokes, general director of Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement. “With such constant discrepancies in the U.S. and Afghan accounts of what happened, the need for a full transparent independent investigation is ever more critical.” Tuesday, Oct. 6: A hospital was mistakenly struck. We would never intentionally target a protected medical facility. —Gen. Campbell in testimony to Senate Armed Service Committee …the Department of Defense deeply regrets the loss of innocent lives that resulted from this tragic event. The investigation into how this could have happened is continuing, and we are fully supporting NATO and Afghanistan’s concurrent investigations. We will complete our investigation as soon as possible and provide the facts as they become available.  The U.S. military takes the greatest care in our operations to prevent the loss of innocent life, and when we make mistakes, we own up to them. —Defense Secretary Ash Carter in a statement Four days after the attack, Carter and Campbell shifted their tone, saying the U.S. military was squarely responsible for the attack and those that needed to be held responsible would be.

"[This story has been optimized for offline reading on our apps. For a richer experience, you can find the full version of this story here. An Internet connection is required.] Only a few hours had passed since President Trump pardoned 1st Lt. Clint Lorance and the men of 1st Platoon were still trying to make sense of how it was even possible. How could a man they blamed for ruining their lives, an officer the Army convicted of second-degree murder and other charges, be forgiven so easily? How could their president allow him to just walk free? “I feel like I’m in a nightmare,” Lucas Gray, a former specialist from the unit, texted his old squad leader, who was out of the Army and living in Fayetteville, N.C. “I haven’t been handling it well either,” replied Mike McGuinness on Nov. 15, the day Lorance was pardoned. “There’s literally no point in anything we did or said,” Gray continued. “Now he gets to be the hero . . .” “And we’re left to deal with it,” McGuinness concluded. Lorance had been in command of 1st Platoon for only three days in Afghanistan but in that short span of time had averaged a war crime a day, a military jury found. On his last day before he was dismissed, he ordered his troops to open fire on three Afghan men standing by a motorcycle on the side of the road who he said posed a threat. His actions led to a 19-year prison sentence. He had served six years when Trump, spurred to action by relentless Fox News coverage and Lorance's insistence that he had made a split-second decision to protect his men, set him free. The president’s opponents described the pardon as another instance of Trump subverting the rule of law to reward allies and reap political benefits. Military officials worried that the decision to overturn a case that had already been adjudicated in the military courts sent a signal that war crimes were not worthy of severe punishment. For the men of 1st platoon, part of the 82nd Airborne Division, the costs of the war and the fallout from the case have been profound and sometimes deadly. Traumatized by battle, they have also been brutalized by the politicization of their service and made to feel as if the truth of what they lived in Afghanistan — already a violent and harrowing tour before Lorance assumed command — had been so demeaned that it no longer existed. Since returning home in 2013, five of the platoon’s three dozen soldiers have died. At least four others have been hospitalized following suicide attempts or struggles with drugs or alcohol. The last fatality came a few weeks before Lorance was pardoned when James O. Twist, 27, a Michigan state trooper and father of three, died of suicide. As the White House was preparing the official order for Trump’s signature, the men of 1st Platoon gathered in Grand Rapids, Mich., for the funeral, where they remembered Twist as a good soldier who had bravely rushed through smoke and fire to pull a friend from a bomb crater and place a tourniquet on his right leg where it had been sheared off by the blast. They thought of the calls and texts from him that they didn’t answer because they were too busy with their own lives — and Twist, who had a caring wife, a good job and a nice house, seemed like he was doing far better than most. They didn’t know that behind closed doors he was at times verbally abusive, ashamed of his inner torment and, like so many of them, unable to articulate his pain. By November 2019, Twist, a man the soldiers of 1st Platoon loved, was gone and Lorance was free from prison and headed for New York City, a new life and a star turn on Fox News. This story is based on a transcript of Lorance’s 2013 court-martial at Fort Bragg, N.C., and on-the-record interviews with 15 members of 1st Platoon, as well as family members of the soldiers, including Twist’s father and wife. The soldiers also shared texts and emails they exchanged over the past several years. Twist’s family provided his journal entries from his time in the Army. Lorance declined to be interviewed. In New York, Sean Hannity, Lorance’s biggest champion and the man most responsible for persuading Trump to pardon him, asked Lorance about the shooting and soldiers under his command. Lorance had traded in his Army uniform for a blazer and red tie. He leaned in to the microphone. “I don’t know any of these guys. None of them know me,” Lorance said of his former troops. “To be honest with you, I can’t even remember most of their names.” The 1st Platoon soldiers came to the Army and the war from all over the country: Maryland, California, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Indiana and Texas to name just a few. They joined for all the usual reasons: “To keep my parents off my a--,” said one soldier. “I just needed a change,” said another. A few had tried college but quit because they were bored or failing their classes. “I didn’t know how to handle it,” Gray said of college. “I was really immature.” Others joined right out of high school propelled by romantic notions, inherited from veteran fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers, of service and duty. Twist’s father served in Vietnam as a clerk in an air-conditioned office before coming back to Michigan and opening a garage. In his spare time Twist Sr. was a military history buff, a passion that rubbed off on his son, who visited World War II battle sites in Europe with his dad. Twist was just 16 when he started badgering his parents to sign his enlistment papers and barely 18 when he left for basic training. His mother had died of cancer only a few months earlier. “I got pictures of him the day we dropped him off, and he didn’t even wave goodbye,” his father recalled. “He was in pig heaven.” Several of the 1st Platoon soldiers enlisted in search of a steady paycheck and the promise of health insurance and a middle-class life. “I needed to get out of northeast Ohio,” McGuinness said. “There wasn’t anything there.” In 1999, he was set to pay his first union dues and go to work alongside his steelworker grandfather when the plant closed. So he became a paratrooper instead, eventually deploying three times to Afghanistan. McGuinness didn’t look much like a paratrooper with his thick, squat body. But he liked being a soldier, jumping out of planes, firing weapons and drinking with his Army buddies. After a while the war didn’t make much sense, but he took pride in knowing that his soldiers trusted him and that he was good at his job. Nine months before 1st Platoon landed in rural southern Afghanistan, a team of Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden. Samuel Walley, the badly wounded soldier Twist pulled from the blast crater, wondered if they might be spared combat. “Wasn’t that the goal to kill bin Laden?” he recalled thinking. “Isn’t that checkmate?” Around the same time, Twist was trying to make sense of what was to come. “I feel like the Army was a good decision, but also in my mind is a lot of dark thoughts,” he wrote in a spiral notebook. “I could die. I could come back with PTSD. I could be massively injured.” “Maybe,” he hoped, “it will start winding down soon.” But the decade-long war continued, driven by new, largely unattainable goals. When McGuinness saw where the platoon was headed — just 15 or so miles from the spot in southern Afghanistan where he had spent his second tour — he warned the new soldiers they were going to be “fighting against dudes who just really f---ing hate you.” They were told by commanders they were waging a counterinsurgency war in which their top priority was winning the support of the people and protecting them from the Taliban. But no one seemed entirely sure how to accomplish that goal. They helped build a school that never opened because of a lack of teachers and willing students. They met with village elders who insisted they knew nothing about the Taliban’s operations or plans. In May 2012, they moved to a new compound near Payenzai, a remote Afghan village west of Kandahar, which consisted of little more than mud-walled houses, hardscrabble farmers and the Taliban. So began what Twist described, in a blog post written years later, as an “entire month of despair.” Four soldiers were severely wounded in quick succession. On June 6, Walley lost his leg and arm to a Taliban bomb. Eight days later, yet another enemy mine wounded Mark Kerner and 1st Lt. Dominic Latino, the platoon leader. Then, on June 23, a sniper’s bullet tore through Matthew Hanes’s neck, leaving him paralyzed. The platoon was briefly sent back to a larger base a few miles away to shower, meet with mental-health counselors and pick up their new platoon leader. Lorance had served a tour as an enlisted prison guard in Iraq before attending college and becoming an infantry officer. He had spent the first five months of his Afghanistan tour as a staff officer on a fortified base. This was his first time in combat. “We’re not going to lose any more men to injuries in this platoon,” he told then-Sgt. 1st Class Keith Ayres, his platoon sergeant, shortly after taking over on June 29, according to Ayres’s testimony. His strategy, he said, was a “shock and awe” campaign designed to cow the enemy and intimidate villagers into coughing up valuable intelligence. When an Afghan farmer and his young son approached the outpost’s front gate and asked permission to move a section of razor wire a few feet so that the farmer could get into his field, Lorance threatened to have Twist and the other soldiers on guard duty kill him and his boy. “He pointed at the child . . . at the little, tiny kid,” Twist testified. He estimated the child was 3 or 4 years old. On Lorance’s second day, he ordered two of his sharpshooters to fire within 10 to 12 inches of unarmed villagers. His goal was to make the Afghans wonder why the Americans were shooting at them and motivate them to attend a village meeting that Lorance had scheduled for later in the week, his soldiers testified. His real motive, though, seems to have been cruelty. “It’s funny watching those f---ers dance,” Lorance said, according to the testimony of one of his soldiers. Lorance didn’t pull the trigger. Instead, he stood by his men in the guard towers, picked the targets and issued orders. His troops finally balked when he told them to shoot near children. They refused again a few hours later when he ordered them to file a false report saying that they had taken fire from the village. “If I don’t have the support of my NCOs then I’ll f---ing do it myself,” Lorance exclaimed, according to testimony, referring to noncommissioned officers. On the day of the killings for which he would be convicted, Lorance posted a sign in the platoon headquarters stating that no motorcycles would be permitted in his unit’s sector. The platoon’s soldiers were falsely told before the day’s patrol that motorcycles should be considered “hostile and engaged on sight.” Several soldiers testified that Lorance told them that senior U.S. officials had ordered the change. At least two sergeants recalled the guidance had come from the Afghans and did not apply to U.S. forces. Due to the conflicting testimony, the jury of Army officers acquitted Lorance of changing the rules of engagement. Still, Lorance’s actions left soldiers confused on the critical, life-or-death question of when they were authorized to open fire. The mission that day was a foot patrol into a nearby village to meet the elders. Less than 30 minutes after they rolled out of the gate, three men on a motorcycle approached a cluster of Afghan National Army troops at the front of their formation. Lorance and his troops were standing about 150 to 200 yards away in an orchard, tucked behind a series of five-foot-high mud walls on which the Afghans grew grapes. At the trial, Lorance’s soldiers recalled how he had ordered them to fire. “Why aren’t you shooting?” he demanded. A U.S. soldier fired and missed. The motorcycle carrying the three men, none of whom appeared to be armed, came to a stop. Upon hearing the shots, McGuinness began running toward Lorance, who was closer to the front of the U.S. patrol, to see why they were shooting. The puzzled Afghans were now standing next to the stopped motorcycle, “trying to figure out what had happened,” according to one soldier’s testimony. Gray, who was watching from a nearby armored vehicle, recognized the eldest of the three men as someone the Americans regularly met with in the village. He recalled the Afghans waving at them. “Smoke ’em,” Lorance ordered over the radio. At first Gray and the other soldiers in the armored vehicle weren’t sure whom Lorance wanted them to shoot. “There was a back and forth with the three of us in the vehicle,” Gray recalled in an interview. Then Pvt. David Shilo, who was in the turret of the armored vehicle just inches from Gray, fired, striking one of the men, who fell into a drainage ditch. Because the platoon had been told that morning that motorcycles weren’t allowed in their sector, Shilo testified that he thought he was acting on a lawful order. Shilo declined to be interviewed. The two surviving Afghan men bent to retrieve their dead colleague when Shilo cleared his weapon and shot again, killing a second Afghan. The third man ran away. Two U.S. soldiers testified that it was possible that an Afghan soldier also fired. A few minutes later, a boy approached the dead men and the motorcycle, which was standing on the side of the road with its kickstand still down. Lorance ordered Shilo to fire a third time and disable the bike. This time he refused. “I wasn’t going to shoot a 12-year-old boy,” Shilo testified. Relatives of the dead were now on the scene screaming and crying. Lorance’s immediate superior officer, Capt. Patrick Swanson, who was two miles away and couldn’t see what was happening, ordered him over the radio to search the bodies. Lorance was convicted of lying to Swanson, telling him that villagers had carried off the corpses before his men could examine them. In fact, Lorance’s troops searched the bodies of the dead Afghans and found ID cards, scissors, some pens and three cucumbers, but no weapons, according to testimony. The troops continued their patrol into the village while McGuinness and a small team of soldiers provided cover from a nearby roof. About 30 minutes after the first shooting, McGuinness spotted two Afghan men talking on radios. “We have to do something to the Americans,” one of the men was saying, according to U.S. intercepts. McGuinness and his troops received permission from the company headquarters to fire and killed the two men. The platoon cut short the patrol and returned to the base. At the outpost the soldiers were shaken. “This doesn’t feel right,” Gray said. “It’s not f---ing right at all,” McGuinness replied. A few minutes later Lorance burst into the platoon’s headquarters ebullient. “That was f---ing awesome,” he exclaimed, according to court testimony. “Ayres looked sick,” one of the platoon’s soldiers testified. McGuinness was furious. The lieutenant tried to reassure his sergeants. “I know how to report it up [so] nobody gets in trouble,” he said, according to testimony. Lorance’s soldiers turned him in that evening, and at the July 2013 trial, 14 of his men testified under oath against him. Four of those soldiers received immunity in exchange for their testimony. Lorance did not appear on the stand, and not one of his former 1st Platoon soldiers spoke in his defense. The trial lasted three days. It took the jury of Army officers three hours to find him guilty of second-degree murder, making false statements and ordering his men to fire at Afghan civilians. The jury handed down a 20-year sentence. In response to a Lorance clemency request, an Army general reviewed the conviction and reduced the sentence by one year. The war crimes and their aftermath followed Lorance’s soldiers home to Fort Bragg and, in some cases, into their nightmares. On many nights Gray woke up to the image of a group of Afghan soldiers surrounding his cot and emptying their rifles into his sleeping body in retaliation for the murders. “I dreamed it,” he said, “because I thought that’s what would happen.” Dave Zettel wasn’t on the patrol when the killings were committed but was in the guard tower when Lorance ordered him and another soldier to fire harassing shots into the neighboring village. On his first full day back in the States, Zettel went out to a dinner with a large group from the platoon and their families. By the end of the night, the soldiers, rattled from the tour, the stress of Lorance’s upcoming trial and the return home, were intoxicated and emotionally falling apart. Zettel held it together until he was alone in a taxi with his wife and brother. In the quiet of the cab, he felt a crushing guilt that he had made it home unscathed. “I just lost my s---. I felt like a failure,” he said. “I felt abandoned and so f---ing angry.” In Afghanistan, Army investigators, who were primarily pursuing Lorance, threatened Zettel with aggravated assault charges for the shootings in the tower. And they showed McGuinness a charge sheet accusing him of murder for killing the Afghans who were talking on the radios about targeting Americans. The threats of prosecution hung over them for months. Eventually, the Army concluded that McGuinness’s actions were justified. Prosecutors never pursued charges against Zettel. Instead the Army issued administrative letters of reprimand to Zettel and Matthew Rush, the soldier who fired the rounds at the civilians from the tower. Zettel had watched from the tower but did not shoot. Ayres and McGuinness — the senior sergeants in the platoon — received disciplinary letters, which can hinder or delay promotions, for their failure to turn Lorance in sooner or stop the killings on the third day. McGuinness legally changed his surname, which had been Herrmann, in an effort to shed the stigma of the crimes. “I wanted to get away from the entire situation and I thought I’ll change units and no one will know,” he said. But, because of the investigation and trial, McGuinness’s orders to report to an airborne unit in Italy were canceled. “I ended up staying. People didn’t forget,” he said. “It was awful.” Shilo, who fired the fatal shots at the men on the motorcycle, was granted immunity and left the Army not long after the trial. Even those who weren’t punished or even on the patrol that day felt tainted. To some of their fellow troops they were the “murder platoon,” a bunch of out-of-control soldiers who had wantonly killed Afghans. To others they were turncoats who had flipped on their commander. Gray was waiting for a parachute jump at Fort Bragg when he overheard a lieutenant colonel deride the platoon as nothing but a bunch of “traitors and cowards.” Gray was just a low-ranking specialist, so he kept his mouth shut. The unit had seen some of the heaviest fighting of the long Afghanistan war, but received no awards for valor. There was no recognition for Twist, who had pulled Walley from a blast crater and applied a tourniquet to the remains of his arm and leg. No one acknowledged Joe Fjeldheim, the platoon medic, who had cut a hole in Hanes’s neck and inserted a breathing tube after a sniper’s bullet left him paralyzed and choking for air. “Not a single write up. The only thing we received were Purple Hearts for the guys that got messed up,” Zettel said. “We were treated like we had an infectious disease. The Lorance issue evaporated any support from the Army when we got back, and it was absolutely crushing to those who needed help.” A group from the unit gathered regularly at Zettel’s apartment off post to drink. Some Saturdays Fjeldheim would show up at 9:30 a.m. with booze and a plan to stay numb through the weekend. When the troops were too hung over to make it to mandatory morning formation and training, he would administer intravenous drips in the barracks. “I was working at Macy’s, and I’d dread coming home because someone was doing something stupid or crying in the bathroom,” said Zettel’s wife, Kim. Often, it fell to her to offer a bit of empathy. The soldiers blamed the killings when they were passed over for promotions or stripped of rank for drinking too much or missing formations. In early 2014, Gray was hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal and put on suicide watch. He had been drinking a half-gallon of whiskey each night to fall asleep. “It was my off switch,” he said. A few days into his hospital stay, when he was still dosed up on Valium, an officer visited him. “Why are you like this?” the officer pressed. “They are just dead Afghans. Why do you care so much?” The question infuriated Gray. Before the war crimes, he had believed he was helping Afghans and defending his country. “It’s like you’re this hardcore Christian and some entity drops from the ceiling and says it’s a sham,” he said. “That’s how it was for me. I thought of the Army as this altruistic thing. I thought it was perfect and honorable. It pains me to tell you how stupid and naive I was. The Lorance stuff just broke my faith. . . . And once you lose your values and your faith, the Army is just another job you hate.” McGuinness tried to intervene on behalf of his soldiers. He talked to Gray’s new commanders, who McGuinness said wanted to run him out of the Army for being drunk. “Did you ask him why he’s drinking too much?” McGuinness pressed them. Zettel asked McGuinness to meet with his new platoon sergeant when the Army, without explanation, blocked him from attending Ranger School. McGuinness also spoke up for Jarred Ruhl, who had been one of his best soldiers in combat. Ruhl came home from Afghanistan with orders for Hawaii and a promotion to sergeant. But he soon began skipping morning formation, was demoted twice to private first class and forced from the Army. “I just don’t know how to deal with everything that happened,” Ruhl told him. He had been standing next to Lorance when the lieutenant gave the orders to kill the Afghan men. McGuinness, who said he felt like a failure for not stopping the killings or shielding his men from the fallout, was also self-destructing. “I was mouthy and insubordinate,” he said. He felt distant from his two young children and said he was drunk “six days a week.” When conservatives rushed to turn Lorance into a hero, McGuinness felt as though the last shreds of his integrity were under assault. Former Lt. Col. Allen West, who had been relieved of command in 2003 for staging a mock execution of an Iraqi prisoner and was later elected to Congress in the tea party wave, blasted Lorance’s conviction in a Washington Times op-ed as a product of the Army’s “appalling” rules of engagement. The rules were drafted by generals who worried that high civilian casualty rates were driving Afghans to support the Taliban. But West insisted that the rules put U.S. troops at undue risk and reflected President Barack Obama’s “outrageous contempt for the military.” West didn’t respond to a request for comment. Fox News’s Sean Hannity took up Lorance’s case, calling the conviction a “national disgrace.” In 2014, McGuinness was out drinking with an Army friend, and when the friend went home, stayed at the bar until he had downed enough booze to “sedate a rhino.” A military police officer found him later that night, sitting in his truck on All American Parkway, the main drag through Fort Bragg, with a gun in his mouth. A nurse in the psychiatric ward at Womack Army Medical Center asked him if he really wanted help. “If you tell me that to get better, I’ve got to eat a 100-pound bag of gummy bears, then I’m going to eat 100 pounds of gummy bears,” he recalled telling her. “I just can’t do this s--- any more.” It was the end of a 16-year Army career. Soon the platoon began to suffer losses at home. First Kerner, who was wounded in a bomb blast with the unit’s first platoon leader, died in March 2015 of cancer at age 23. Doctors discovered the malignancy when they were treating his combat wounds. Five months later Hanes, who was paralyzed by the bullet he took to his neck, died of a blood clot at age 24. “Saying I love you doesn’t even scratch the surface of how much you truly mean to me,” he wrote in a note to the platoon three months before he fell into a coma. His closest friends from the unit — Zettel, Dallas Haggard and Fjeldheim, the medic who saved his life — were at his bedside in York, Pa., during his final unconscious hours. At the funeral there was heavy drinking, just like at Bragg, but now that many in the platoon were out of the Army and no longer had to worry about drug tests, there was also cocaine to numb the pain. Wives traded tips about how to persuade their husbands to go to therapy and talked about hiding their guns when they grew too depressed. Ruhl complained to McGuinness that life at home felt empty. “Are you in therapy?” asked McGuinness, who was seeing a therapist and getting ready to start college at age 33. “I don’t know if I can do it,” Ruhl said. “It doesn’t f---ing matter what you think you can do,” he pressed. “It can’t make things worse.” A few months later Zettel, who had finished college and was commissioned as an officer, stopped in to see Ruhl at his home in Fort Wayne, Ind. Zettel was on his way to a leadership course for new Army officers in Missouri. Ruhl’s stepbrother told him that Ruhl had pulled a gun on a woman in a traffic dispute just days earlier. “Take his gun,” Zettel advised Ruhl’s stepbrother. “Take it apart and hide the pieces so that he can’t get it.” It was impossible, the stepbrother said. Ruhl took his gun everywhere. Ruhl confided to Zettel that there were days when he couldn’t stop thinking about killing himself. “How are we going to fix this?” asked Zettel, who helped Ruhl sign up for counseling at a VA hospital. Before he could start, Ruhl pulled his gun on an acquaintance at a party. His stepbrother tried to wrestle it away and the firearm discharged, severing Ruhl’s femoral artery. He died before paramedics arrived. Zettel came back for the funeral, then returned to Missouri to finish his five-month leadership course. Four years had passed since the war crimes, but the murders and their aftermath still seemed inescapable. A captain teaching Zettel’s class on rules of engagement used Lorance as a case study, telling the new officers that Lorance had been trying to impose discipline on a platoon that had lost control after one of its soldiers was shot in the neck. The captain was referring to Hanes, who had given Zettel his first salute when he was commissioned as an officer. Lorance’s soldiers, the captain continued, had violated the rules of engagement and now Lorance, who hadn’t fired a shot, was serving a 19-year prison sentence. Zettel blew up. “I was there and you need to stop running your mouth,” he recalled shouting at the instructor. The instructor suggested they step out of the classroom. Zettel grew angrier. “If I ever see Lorance on the street,” he said. “I am going to rip his f---ing throat out.” Six days after Trump was inaugurated as president, Hannity asked him in a White House interview about pardoning Lorance. “He got 30 years,” Hannity said incorrectly. “He was doing his job, protecting his team in Afghanistan.” “We’re looking at a few of them,” said Trump of the case. In the months after his conviction, Lorance had begun to receive support from United American Patriots (UAP), a nonprofit group that represents soldiers accused of war crimes. UAP helped Lorance find new lawyers who claimed in an appeals court filing that they had uncovered evidence showing that the younger victim was “biometrically linked” to a roadside bomb blast that occurred before his death. The sole survivor, the lawyers said, took part in attacks on U.S. forces after the Americans tried to kill him. “The Afghan men were not civilian casualties . . . but were actually combatant bombmakers who intended to harm or kill American soldiers,” the lawyers wrote in their appeal. In 2017, a military appeals court dismissed the biometric data as irrelevant because Lorance had “no indications that the victims posed any threat at the time of the shootings.” The judges found that the surviving victim’s decision to join the Taliban after the platoon tried to kill him probably would have helped prosecutors by demonstrating “the direct impact on U.S. forces when the local population believe they are being indiscriminately killed.” But the biometric evidence and support from UAP helped Lorance’s mother and his legal team get on Trump’s favorite television shows — “Fox & Friends” and “Hannity” — where they offered a new account of the killings that differed dramatically from the sworn testimony. In their telling, the motorcycle wasn’t stopped on the side of the road with its kickstand down, as testimony and photos from the trial demonstrated, but was speeding toward Lorance and his men when he ordered them to fire. “He’s got to make a split-second decision in a war zone,” Hannity said on his television show. “How did it get to the point where he got prosecuted for this?” “I feel if he had not made that call,” Lorance’s mother replied, “my son today would be called a hero, killed in action.” Hannity turned to Lorance’s lawyer, John Maher. “Was there anybody in the platoon that was with Clint that said that was the wrong decision?” he asked. “That I don’t rightly know,” replied Maher, who had reviewed the platoon’s testimony. “Then who made the determination that this was the wrong thing to do?” Hannity pressed. “The chain of command,” Maher said. “People that weren’t there,” Hannity concluded. Hannity and a Fox News spokeswoman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a recent interview, Maher said his response to Hannity’s question had been “potentially inartful.” Lorance was in prison because the 1st Platoon soldiers turned him in and testified against him. But Maher maintained that Lorance had made a split-second decision to protect his men from an enemy ambush. Some of the 1st Platoon soldiers said that the Afghan men had been standing on the side of the road for as long as two minutes before the U.S. gun truck opened fire on Lorance’s orders. Others, including Lorance, estimated they had been stopped for only a few seconds. “That’s probably an eternity sitting here in the safety of this environment,” Maher said. “But I assure you that it’s not like that under volatile, uncertain, unforgiving conditions where life and death are right around the corner and a tardy decision results in death or dismemberment.” The Afghan men were about 150 to 200 yards from the U.S. position when they were killed. To reach Lorance and his troops, they would have had to scale multiple shoulder-high mud walls. Zach Thomas, who had been standing just yards from Lorance when he gave the order to fire, was driving to community college in 2017 when he heard Hannity talking about the Lorance case on the radio. “My blood just started boiling,” he recalled. Thomas had spent his last day in the Army testifying against his former platoon leader. He was just 18 when he left for Afghanistan, and like many in the unit, his return home had been difficult. He drank to blunt his PTSD and depression. Two of his sergeants were so worried about him that they let him move out of the barracks and spend his last two months living at their house. His plan after the Army was to forget about Afghanistan and start a new life in his hometown of Crosby, Tex. Thomas pulled over on the side of the road and looked up the number for Hannity’s radio show in New York City on his cellphone. “I’m a big fan, but y’all are being led the wrong way,” he told a producer for the show. “This isn’t some innocent guy.” The producer asked him if he knew about the biometric data Lorance’s lawyers had uncovered. “I don’t know about any of that information, but I was there and these people were not enemy combatants,” he said. He could tell he wasn’t convincing the producer so he gave her McGuinness’s cellphone number and urged her to call him. She talked with McGuinness as well but never invited him on the show. A handful of other soldiers from the platoon did their best to counter Lorance’s story. Todd Fitzgerald, who was also standing near Lorance when he ordered the killings, took to Reddit to defend the unit. He and several other soldiers spoke to the New York Times for a story that detailed the inaccuracies in Lorance’s defense. Fitzgerald, McGuinness and Gray were interviewed for a documentary about the case, “Leavenworth,” that aired on the Starz Network. In April 2018, the platoon suffered its fourth death since returning home when Nick Carson, 26, crashed his car late at night. Carson had been with McGuinness in Afghanistan on the day of the killings, and like his squad leader had been threatened with war crimes charges. “I don’t know what’s fixing to happen, but our platoon leader is making us all out to be murderers,” he told his parents in a 2012 phone call from Afghanistan. “Just know, I am not a murderer.” Carson’s mother and stepfather were at Fort Bragg a few months later when he returned from the war. “He got off that big plane, hugged us and cried and then he said, ‘I love y’all but I need to be by myself. I just need to go,’ ” recalled his stepfather. Carson stayed in the Army after the combat tour, but he struggled with PTSD, depression and anger. He and Ruhl had been best friends and were supposed to go to Hawaii together when they returned from Afghanistan. After Ruhl’s death, Carson tried to explain on the platoon’s private Facebook page why he was skipping his friend’s funeral. “It’s not that I can’t physically be there,” he wrote. “I won’t let my last memory of Jarred be at his funeral. I am sorry for that. Most of you know how close Jarred and I were, so this has been extremely difficult to accept.” On the night of the car accident that killed him, Carson had been drinking and wasn’t wearing a seat belt. His parents said he may have fallen asleep while driving. The platoon blamed the war crimes and the deployment. In Afghanistan, the platoon had dubbed themselves the “Honey Badgers” after the fearless carnivore. Back home, they began to refer to themselves as “the cursed platoon.” On October 23rd at 2:44 a.m., Twist’s wife, Emalyn, messaged Sgt. 1st Class Joe Morrissey, who had been Twist’s team leader with the platoon in Afghanistan. “James committed suicide tonight,” she wrote from the hospital where the doctors were preparing to harvest his organs. “Could you let his other Army friends know. . . . This is a fucking living nightmare.” It was the platoon’s fifth death since returning home four years earlier. Morrissey woke to the message at Fort Bragg and began sobbing. His soon-to-be ex-wife knew immediately that another member of the platoon was gone. His first call was to McGuinness, who was returning home from a late-night shift as a bouncer at a Fayetteville bar. The two immediately began calling the rest of the platoon, which was scattered across the country. The deaths had imbued them with a grim fatalism. “Who is it this time?” a few answered when they saw the 5 a.m. calls from Morrissey’s phone. “It’s James,” Morrissey said again and again. At Fort Jackson, Zettel was administering a predawn fitness test to recruits when he got the call. He punched a fence and rushed back to his office so the new soldiers wouldn’t see him fall apart. Alone at his desk, Zettel thought about the steady stream of calls and texts Twist had sent him over the past five years, and he wondered if the messages were an indirect way of asking for help. McGuinness caught Gray as he headed off to his job at a weapons arsenal in southwest Virginia. His wallpaper on his work computer was a photo of Twist and him in Afghanistan, their rifles slung across their chests. “Back when we were cool,” Twist had written when he texted it to Gray. The hardest call was to Walley, the soldier Twist had dragged from the blast crater. “What’s wrong?” his fiancee asked him when he got the call. “It’s Twist,” Walley told her. She tried to hug him, but he pushed her away. “I need to take this in alone,” he said. At the funeral, Walley spoke first for the platoon, rocking back and forth on his prosthetic leg. Walley was wounded a month before the murders, but they had affected him too. At times, he felt abandoned by those who had tried to distance themselves from the unit, the murders and the war. “I have to wake up every single day and look in the mirror. Every single day I am hopping in a wheelchair,” he often thought. “I don’t get to forget.” In January 2016, he was drunk and despondent in his apartment outside Atlanta and accidentally fired his pistol through the ceiling and into the apartment above him. After the shooting, Walley cut back on his drinking and returned to college. He was just one semester from graduating. He stared out at the packed and silent church. “Twist would probably give me a little bit of crap right now for having not wrote a speech,” he began. “But I figured I’d just tell a story. It’s a little bit of a harsh story, but I think it needs to be told.” Walley had spent dozens of hours reconstructing every second of the day he was injured. Eight years after the blast, he and his fellow soldiers would still argue over the smallest details: What kind of bomb had caused his wounds? Was it a pressure plate or remote-detonated? What exactly did Morrissey say as he and Carson lifted Walley into the helicopter? For Walley, the details were sacred. Remembering brought him comfort. He took a breath and described the explosion and its aftermath. “My right leg was about 20 feet away. It was completely removed. My left leg, the tibia ripped through the [skin]; my foot was facing toward my butt,” he said. His right arm was mangled. “Twist ended up coming through this cloudy haze,” Walley continued. “He was the most selfless man that I ever knew on this planet. He did not care if he died. He did not care if his limbs were to get ripped off. He didn’t care. He just cared that his guys were okay.” A few minutes in a combat zone can define a life for good or for ill. “I believe that 10 minutes defined Twist,” Walley said. Morrissey spoke next of Twist’s successes as a soldier, state trooper and father. “Those of us who knew Twist were extremely proud,” he said. “Unfortunately . . . underneath it all, the demons are still there, still tearing away at us day in and day out.” The 1st Platoon soldiers were still filtering home from Twist’s funeral when Pete Hegseth, a “Fox & Friends” co-anchor who had advocated on Lorance’s behalf, tweeted that Lorance’s pardon was “imminent.” The actual release came two weeks later on Nov. 15. “It’s done. It’s a political move,” one of the 1st Platoon soldiers wrote on the group’s private Facebook page. “Time to move on.” Ayres, who had skipped all five of the platoon’s funerals, agreed. “Not worth any of our time,” he wrote. “What matters is that everyone that matters knows he is a piece of s---. Let’s move on and enjoy life.” For McGuinness it wasn’t an option. He couldn’t bear the thought that Lorance was being hailed as a hero by Trump and others, while soldiers like Twist were being forgotten. “I’ve buried people that struggled with what happened, and whether through their own hands or their actions, they’re gone,” he said. “I’m not going to sit quietly while he gets paraded around and they’re not recognized.” He texted with Gray, who wasn’t on Facebook. ""Fuck it all,"" Gray wrote. ""The one reprieve we had is gone."" ""I feel so shitty right now,"" McGuinness replied. ""I'm going to drink until I can sleep,"" Gray added. ""I might do the same,"" McGuinness said. Others in the platoon argued on social media with pro-Trump friends, who insisted Lorance was innocent. ""You realize I was f---ing THERE, right?"" one soldier wrote to a fellow veteran. ""Like you realize I was one of the godd--- WITNESSES who testified, right?!"" Later that evening, Twist’s father, John, called McGuinness, hoping to talk about his son and the pardon. McGuinness shared his memories of Twist, who came to the platoon when he was just 19. “We put so much work into him,” McGuinness said. He talked about Twist’s quirks — his irritating tendency to correct McGuinness when he got a minor fact wrong about a weapons system. Twist’s father asked whether the murders and the trial might have contributed to his son’s torment. Twist wasn’t on patrol the day of the killings, but McGuinness believed that what had happened with Lorance had wounded him too. “Twist had a big heart. He was like Gray. He wanted to do good,” McGuinness said. “When Lorance took that away, he took a little part of Jimmy, too.” “This is absolutely amazing,” Lorance said as his car, escorted by the county constable, rolled to a stop in the high school parking lot. “It’s a hometown hero’s welcome,” said his cousin from the back seat. Lorance climbed atop a flatbed trailer. Someone from the crowd gave him an American flag. The vice commander of the local VFW handed him a microphone. “God Bless Texas!” Lorance yelled. “God Bless America!” At his side was the head of UAP, the group that had worked to free him. Lorance’s case and the publicity generated helped the group boost annual donations by about 150 percent, from $1.8 million in 2015 to more than $4.5 million in 2018. Lorance, who was wearing his crisp, blue Army uniform — his pants tucked into his boots, paratrooper style — knew exactly what his backers wanted to hear. “We finally have a president who understands that when we send our troops to fight impossible wars, we must stand behind them,” he told the crowd. “Amen!” cried a voice from the high school parking lot. “Amen is right!” Lorance answered. For those in the parking lot that night, Lorance’s freedom was proof that Trump would stand up for them and their town, population 215, at a moment when large swaths of the country seemed to hold them and their way of life in contempt. “You know how many people just want to see that someone cares,” said Tiffany West, 37, who was standing feet from the stage. Lorance thanked his family and the lawmakers who pressed for his release. He talked about Trump and Vice President Pence, who had called him at the penitentiary to tell him that they were setting him free. “We had a nine-minute conversation,” Lorance said. “Yeah, I was timing it. . . . They took time out of their busy day to ask me what I was going to do with the rest of my life.” He blasted the craven “deep state” military officers he blamed for his conviction. “That’s not really the military. That’s the politicians who run the thing,” he said. “The men and women in the mud and dirt. That’s the real U.S. military.” He was still talking nearly an hour later when the television news crews from Dallas, about 60 miles away, began packing up their equipment. “I’m sorry,” he apologized. “I know it’s cold.” “Go ahead!” a voice shouted. “You’re home!” added another. Soon the crowd began drifting away for the night, past Merit’s post office, its volunteer fire department, its recently shuttered convenience store, and the decaying wood clapboard building that once held its cotton gin. Lorance handed the microphone back to the local VFW’s vice commander, a Gulf War veteran who had organized the gathering and would now get the final word. “There’s going to be people out there that are going to try to use this against Trump,” he warned. “Well, we’re going to throw it right back in their faces!” The next morning Lorance boarded a plane for New York City, where he appeared on “Fox & Friends” and Hannity’s radio show. In December, he joined Trump onstage at a GOP fundraiser. In interviews after his release, Lorance insisted that the soldiers who testified against him were pressured by the Army or had turned on him because he was an exacting commander and they lacked discipline. “When I walked into the guard tower and the soldiers didn’t have their helmet or body armor on, I told them to put it on,” he told Blue Magazine, which advocates on behalf of police officers. “And they didn’t like that, they didn’t like taking orders like that, but I was brought in there to enforce the standard.” In Grand Rapids, Twist’s father spent much of the winter trying to unravel the mystery of his son’s death. His dining room table was covered with foot-high piles of papers from James’s life. There were old report cards, passports and programs from high school wrestling matches. A second pile from the Army included a spiral notebook that his son had used as a diary when he was going through basic training. A third pile contained a printout of the essay — “The Invisible War Inside My Head” — that his son wrote the day before he died. In it, Twist wrote briefly about the killings that had “rocked and split up” his platoon. The longest section of the essay recounted the day Walley lost his arm and leg. “I found Sam in a small crater,” he wrote. “He was missing his right foot and all the muscle and skin around his right tibia/fibula.” That image, he said, played again and again in his head when he returned from the war. “I really don’t understand what PTSD is,” his father said. “You can read about it, but I don’t get it. So far the only thing I can get is that it’s like having . . . poor Sam Walley getting blown up” playing in your head over and over. “And how do you get rid of that?” Twist’s wife, Emalyn, 27, also had been thinking about the meaning of her husband’s life and sudden, violent death. In early March she was sitting alone in the parking lot of a nearby Target. Her three children — ages 1, 3 and 5 — were with a friend. She balanced a Starbucks coffee in one hand and hit record on her cellphone camera. “It has been kind of a bad week, filled with a lot of ‘it shouldn’t have to be that way’ kind of moments,” she said. Earlier that morning, she had turned over their house keys to the new owners. Her 5-year-old son spotted the family’s moving trucks in the driveway and panicked, yelling for her to “stop them.” Twist’s children remembered their father as a dad who liked to wrestle and sing them to sleep. Emalyn couldn’t forget her husband’s insecurity, bouts of self-loathing and verbal abuse. On the night her husband took his life he was upset with her for going to see a therapist and terrified that she was going to divorce him. In a blog post, Emalyn described him slamming his head into the kitchen counter until blood was running down his face. Then he stormed to their bedroom and shot himself. Emalyn pressed a pair of leggings to her husband’s head in a futile attempt to stop the bleeding. With her other hand, she dialed 911. As she listened for the sound of approaching sirens, she stifled the urge to vomit and prayed that their children would not wake. “I couldn’t stand to live in that house or sleep in that bedroom when I had seen so much in there, and that just makes me mad, because I loved that house and I loved that neighborhood,” she said to her cellphone camera. “And I shouldn’t have had to leave. I shouldn’t have had to pull my kids out of their little social circle and all those people who loved them. It shouldn’t have to be that way.” For years she had helped her husband hide his pain from family, friends and even his fellow soldiers. Now she was determined to be honest. “I just don’t have to keep up this facade of the grieving widow all the time, even though that’s also what I am,” she said. “There’s almost always more to every story than we know. It’s important to pay attention to that.” She stopped recording, turned on the ignition and picked up with her day. In April with the country locked down by the coronavirus, McGuinness arranged for a dozen of the guys from the platoon to get together on a video call for beers. He and Walley were finishing up their last few college courses before they graduated. A couple of the soldiers and wives were expecting their first children. Two were in the early days of divorces. An hour into the call almost everyone was drunk or stoned — except for the pregnant wives. One soldier kept streaming as he sat on the toilet. When he was done everyone screamed at him to wash his hands. Another soldier vomited and curled up on the floor. “This is better than getting together at funerals,” McGuinness said cheerily. The troops talked about their plans for the future. Morrissey was just back from another tour in Afghanistan, where he mostly sat on base while the Afghans fought each other. “There’s no war left there anymore,” he said. “What are you going to do when you retire?” McGuinness asked him. “Let me finish, before you laugh,” Morrissey replied. “I’m going to go to school to be a barber and open one of those high end barber shops where you can get a drink, a real gentleman’s haircut and shave with a straight razor.” Walley tried to talk, but everyone was talking over him. “No one listens to me,” he joked. “Everyone just stares at the guy with two limbs.” He and his fiancee were planning their wedding for the spring of 2021. They had already reserved a “mansion where we can fit the whole platoon,” he said. “Just tell me the day and I’ll be there,” McGuinness promised. Zettel and his wife were expecting their first child on Aug. 10. He was planning on leaving the Army for good in October. “It’s not going to join the Army,” Zettel said of his unborn child. “I’m going to burn everything so it doesn’t even know I was in the f---ing Army.” The soldiers talked about the guys they had lost to suicide and self-destructive behavior. And they spoke briefly about Lorance, who has a memoir titled “Stolen Valor” that is going to be published by Hachette Book Group in the fall, when Lorance has said he is planning to start law school. A blurb for the book, posted by the publisher, calls Lorance “a scapegoat for a corrupt military” and asserts that “his unit turned on him because of his homosexuality.” Lorance’s lawyer said there was no evidence that homophobia played a role in conviction. “We looked,” Maher said, “and we came up with nothing.” In interviews, troops said that in Afghanistan they didn’t know Lorance was gay and wouldn’t have cared. “We took s--- from so many people for so long,” McGuinness said. “I’m not letting that happen anymore. I’m going to fight back.” The soldiers shared tips about how to find a good therapist and promised to look out for one another so that there would be no more funerals. “You guys mean everything to me,” McGuinness said. “We have to do this more often. We have to look after each other. If you guys are hurting, hit me up. We can do this instead of just letting things fester.” He rose from his desk chair — a little wobbly from all the beer. It was 2:30 a.m., and they had been talking for more than four hours. “I love you a--holes,” he said, and signed off the call."	688	26	666	2023-04-20T14:45:02.235782Z	2023-04-20T14:45:02.235890Z	3351.278	"[{""start"": 1152, ""end"": 1324, ""text"": ""n his last day before he was dismissed, he ordered his troops to open fire on three Afghan men standing by a motorcycle on the side of the road who he said posed a threat."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 9208, ""end"": 9483, ""text"": ""When an Afghan farmer and his young son approached the outpost’s front gate and asked permission to move a section of razor wire a few feet so that the farmer could get into his field, Lorance threatened to have Twist and the other soldiers on guard duty kill him and his boy"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 9485, ""end"": 9917, ""text"": ""“He pointed at the child . . . at the little, tiny kid,” Twist testified.

When President Obama draped the nation’s highest award for combat valor around the neck of an Afghan war hero at the White House in October 2013, a highly decorated Green Beret officer who sat nearby faced an ugly reality: The Army was investigating him on charges of murder and conspiracy. Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn was invited to the ceremony by William D. Swenson, who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in Afghanistan four years earlier. Like Swenson, Golsteyn had braved enemy fire repeatedly, seen fellow soldiers die and voiced deep frustration with the ways he saw U.S. troops restricted in combat. But Golsteyn, a friend of Swenson’s, also may have had a darker chapter to his service. According to Army documents, the young officer disclosed to CIA personnel during a 2011 job interview that he had killed an unarmed Taliban fighter he suspected of being a bombmaker. The documents, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, also suggest an elaborate cover-up that, if true, could amount to serious war crimes involving not only Golsteyn but fellow Green Beret soldiers. [See document excerpts in the Army’s war-crimes case against Maj. Mathew Golsteyn] However, the service closed a lengthy criminal investigation into the case last year without finding any evidence to charge Golsteyn. His lawyer and other supporters say that the service has exaggerated the claims and selectively released details from the case. The case underscores a stunning fall for a highly regarded officer who has been lauded for his leadership and graduated from the prestigious U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 2006. It has also pitted the Army against a war hero. The Army has defended its actions, saying it had conducted its investigation without bias or outside influence. Phillip Stackhouse, Golsteyn’s lawyer, said the narratives laid out in documents from the Army’s Criminal Investigations Command “are taken out of context and are biased.” “It’s fantasy to say he confessed to shooting an unarmed detainee,” he said. The alleged killing of the Taliban fighter in question took place during the iconic Battle of Marja, during which more than 15,000 coalition troops assaulted a Taliban stronghold of mud compounds, canals and poppy fields in Afghanistan’s Helmand province. Dozens of Americans were killed there in following months, with hundreds more wounded. At the height of the battle, an explosion rocked a Marine unit working alongside Golsteyn’s soldiers in Marja. Two Marines — Sgt. Jeremy R. McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19 — were killed in the Feb. 18, 2010, blast, in which explosives were rigged to detonate when a sliding metal door was opened. Three more Marines were evacuated by helicopter with serious injuries. Two days later, Golsteyn braved enemy fire repeatedly after watching a Taliban sniper round nearly hit another Marine who was manning a rooftop observation post on their base. Golsteyn was credited with launching a mission to find the enemy marksmen, slogging through muddy fields under fire to help an Afghan soldier who had been wounded, returning fire with a powerful anti-tank weapon, and coordinating repeated airstrikes by F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a Predator drone. For those actions, he was awarded the Silver Star, the Army’s third-highest award for valor. [Army revokes Silver Star for Green Beret officer, citing investigation] Army Secretary John McHugh later agreed to upgrade Golsteyn’s award to the Distinguished Service Cross, one step below the Medal of Honor. But the secretary decided last fall that Golsteyn would get neither, citing the investigation. The specifics of the allegations against him were unclear at the time, and officials said only that he faced investigation for an undisclosed violation of the rules of engagement in combat. Golsteyn’s Special Forces tab, a qualification awarded to anyone who has completed Green Beret training, was also revoked by Army Special Forces Command. He was reassigned as an regularly infantry officer, effectively removing him from the Special Forces. The newly obtained documents include a three-page report filed in October 2011 by Special Agent Zachary Jackson, an Army investigator, that allege Golsteyn recounted to the CIA that, after the Marines were killed in the Feb. 18 blast, he and his units began clearing homes nearby. They eventually found materials required to make complicated improvised explosive devices similar to the one that had killed the Marines. They brought the suspected bombmaker back to their base, Golsteyn said, according to Army documents. On base, a tribal leader working with the Americans identified the suspected bombmaker as a member of the Taliban — and then the two crossed paths before Golsteyn could prevent it, the soldier said, according to the documents. The tribal leader “immediately became frightened and stated [the suspected Taliban member] was going to kill him and his family,” the Army documents said. Golsteyn, then a member of 3rd Special Force Group, told the CIA during a polygraph test that he trusted the tribal leader working with his unit, and that information he had provided previously saved lives and prevented attacks, according to Army documents. The suspected bombmaker was not on a list of targets U.S. forces had been cleared to kill without following the rules of engagement, but Golsteyn told the CIA he was concerned that if he let the man go, he would have the opportunity to kill American troops, the documents said. “CPT Golsteyn related there had been countless times when he detained someone and sent that person to a detention facility only to see that same person shooting at his unit weeks later,” the Army investigator’s summary of Golsteyn’s polygraph test said. “CPT Golsteyn stated he had no qualms about what he did because he couldn’t have lived with himself if [the suspected bomb maker] killed another Soldier or Marine.” [CIA job interview leads to criminal investigation of Green Beret] According to the documents, Golsteyn recalled to CIA interviewers that he and one other unidentified U.S. soldier took the suspected bombmaker off the base, shot him to death and buried his remains in a shallow grave. He told the CIA that, later that night, he and two other soldiers dug up the remains, brought them back to their base and burned them in a pit used to dispose of trash, according to the documents. The names of the soldiers have been redacted in the documents released to The Post. Virtually all of the U.S. service members interviewed by investigators expressed disbelief that Golsteyn would have killed an unarmed insurgent or covered up his actions. He is described by most of them as an inspiring, decisive leader who saved lives. In Marja, he led not only his Special Forces team, known as Operational Detachment Alpha 3121, but about 30 Marine combat engineers and more than 300 Afghan commandos who fought alongside it. “I have a hard time believing that such an incident ever occurred,” a senior medic in his unit told investigators in December 2011. “I further find it hard to believe that Matt Golsteyn would do that. The only reason I could possibly conceive him doing something like that is if he felt his men’s lives were at direct risk.” There was at least one exception. A Green Beret lieutenant colonel interviewed in April 2012 told investigators that while Golsteyn was a top captain in Special Forces, he also could be insubordinate and act with a sense of impunity, according to a report filed by an Army investigator at Fort Bragg, N.C. “When asked… whether he believed CPT GOLSTEYN committed the offense of Murder, [the lieutenant colonel] stated he would hope not but would not doubt it either because of CPT GOLSTEYN’S attitude,” the report said. Among officers, Golsteyn could be a polarizing figure, former Marine Capt. Michael Barry, who served alongside Golsteyn in Marja, said in an interview. But he was loved by those he commanded in the field. “I was one of the people who loved him, and I still do just because of the way he led,” Barry said. “He was someone who said what he meant, and there was no backstabbing with him. If you asked him a question, he was going to tell you the truth. He wasn’t going to flower it up.” [Army secretary defends stripping Special Forces officer of awards] Barry, now a law student at Louisiana State University, recalled returning to their base in Marja the day that McQueary and Johnson were killed. While looking for insurgents and weapons in a bazaar with a series of stalls, they asked two suspicious-looking men to open storage units that were locked. The explosion killed the two Afghans along with the Marines. Golsteyn was not at the scene of the explosion that killed them, but was overseeing the mission from their nearby operations center and waiting for troops who survived the blast when they returned. “He was pretty shaken up, and I was pretty shaken up, too,” Barry said. “It meant the world to me that he was there waiting for us when we got back.” Afterward, Golsteyn pulled out a bottle of whiskey on the base so they all could toast the fallen Marines, according to the 2011 book “The Wrong War,” by Bing West, who was embedded with Golsteyn’s unit at the time. The move may have brought those under fire that day closer, but it also drew the attention of commanders when West’s book was published, according to Army documents. Drinking alcohol in the field is a violation of a general order. Investigators keyed in on a remark Golsteyn allegedly made at the time — that his team was going to “get” the man responsible for killing McQueary and Johnson. The conversation ended there, however, Barry said, and wasn’t an uncommon pledge for an officer to make in such circumstances. The Army offered immunity to at least two soldiers in exchange for their testimony against Golsteyn, but they refused to talk, according to the documents. It also tested numerous burn pits in southern Marja for human remains, but did not find any evidence of a corpse. Photographs of several of the pits appear in documents released to The Post. Investigators appeared at Swenson’s home in Seattle in May 2012, looking for information about Golsteyn. Swenson’s name is redacted from the documents, but the incident was outlined February in an article by the Daily Beast. Swenson eventually wrote a letter in support of Golsteyn that was circulated around Capitol Hill. He noted that he had completed training with Golsteyn early in their careers and would “gladly stand with him on any battlefield against enemy.” [For Medal of Honor recipient William Swenson, a rocky path to the White House] The Army’s handling of Golsteyn’s case has come under heavy criticism from Rep. Duncan D. Hunter Jr. (R.Calif.), a Marine veteran and frequent critic of the Army secretary. Hunter has repeatedly questioned why the Army stripped Golsteyn of awards and moved more recently to remove him from the service. A board of higher-ranking officers will determine Golsteyn’s future in an administrative hearing tentatively scheduled for next week, although his lawyer said it could be moved to June due to a scheduling conflict. McHugh has stood by his decisions, saying in a letter in February that Golsteyn had “demonstrated a lack of honorable conduct.” Although no charges were filed, investigators found that there was probable cause that Golsteyn “committed the offenses of Murder, Conspiracy and War Crimes, when he conspired with multiple Special Forces team members to commit premeditated murder and desecration of the body afterwards.” Army Criminal Investigation Command defended its actions and conclusions. “Findings of our investigations are thoroughly reviewed by legal authorities,” said a spokesman, Chris Grey. “We stand by the investigative findings of our agents. Due to the upcoming proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.” Ashley Johnson, the older sister of Larry Johnson, one of the Marines killed, expressed dismay with the way the military has treated Golsteyn. She has never met the Army officer once in charge of her brother in Afghanistan, but she would like to someday, she said. “He, from what I read, is a hero and did what he had to do. I believe at a time like that, you wear your heart on your sleeve and I think it’s what anyone with a heart would do,” she said. Johnson added that the suspected insurgent Golsteyn is accused of killing “was the enemy that he believed killed his Marines. “It brings a tear to my eye to know he cared so much,” she said. “He deserves his medals for everything he went through.”	687	26	665	2023-04-20T13:43:21.839205Z	2023-04-20T13:43:21.839307Z	2717.724	"[{""start"": 702, ""end"": 1177, ""text"": ""According to Army documents, the young officer disclosed to CIA personnel during a 2011 job interview that he had killed an unarmed Taliban fighter he suspected of being a bombmaker.

The former Green Beret soldier who was stripped of a prestigious valor award after allegedly disclosing to the CIA the unsanctioned killing of an unarmed insurgent in Afghanistan will leave the service with the bulk of his military benefits intact, a panel of Army officers decided Sunday night. But it’s unlikely that the fallout from the case is over. The decision comes following a week of testimony in an administrative hearing known as a Board of Inquiry. The Army accused Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn of violating the law of armed conflict, but the three-member panel found the allegation unsubstantiated. The panel did find that Golsteyn demonstrated conduct unbecoming an officer, a lesser allegation, and recommended a general discharge under honorable conditions. [Inside the stunning fall and war-crimes investigation of an Army Green Beret war hero] The Army will place a general officer memorandum of reprimand in Golsteyn’s file, said a spokeswoman for Army Special Forces Command, Maj. Allison Aguilar. The action is typically considered a career killer in the military, although Golsteyn already was planning to leave the Army. Special Forces Command had earlier revoked his Special Forces tab, a qualification that goes to any soldier who completes Special Forces training. The results of the hearing were first reported by the Fayetteville Observer. Golsteyn’s lawyer, Phil Stackhouse, said in an interview Monday that he considered the result “a win of sorts,” but said they will fight to get Golsteyn’s discharge from the military upgraded. Similarly, a congressman who threw his support behind Golsteyn, Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R.-Calif.), said he will continue pressing the service to restore a Silver Star award that it had presented to Golsteyn, but later took back during the investigation. “It’s not going to be the end, I’ll tell you that,” Stackhouse said of the hearing. “There’s more that’s going to be coming following this.” Golsteyn could not be reached for comment. Golsteyn led a Special Forces team in Afghanistan in 2010 during the bloody Battle of Marja. He received a Silver Star for heroism that Army Secretary John McHugh later authorized to be upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross, one level below the Medal of Honor. McHugh stripped him of both awards after Golsteyn interviewed for a job with the CIA in 2011. [Army revokes Silver Star for Green Beret officer, citing investigation] Army documents released through the Freedom of Information Act to The Washington Post alleged that Golsteyn disclosed during a polygraph test that he had killed an unarmed man he believed was a Taliban bomb maker after an improvised explosive device had killed two Marines and wounded three others a day earlier, on Feb. 18, 2010. The information was turned over to the Army, but its Criminal Investigation Command (CID) concluded a lengthy investigation last year without finding evidence to charge him with a crime. Soldiers deployed alongside Golsteyn refused to testify against him, even when offered immunity to do so. The Army’s characterization of Golsteyn’s comments in the CIA interview has been questioned repeatedly by the soldier’s supporters, and continued to be during the hearing, according to the Observer. A transcript of the polygraph initially was not allowed into evidence for the hearing, but the decision was reversed Friday. The board attempted to obtain a video of Golsteyn’s polygraph test, but the CIA denied it, the Observer reported. The witnesses who testified on behalf of Golsteyn included Maj. William D. Swenson, a 2011 Medal of Honor recipient; Marine Maj. Gen. Lawrence D. Nicholson; and retired Marine Col. Randall Newman. Swenson testified on what can happen when commanders have an overly restrictive interpretation of the rules of engagement, Stackhouse said. Nicholson and Newman were the senior commanders in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, where Golsteyn was deployed, and oversaw U.S. operations during the Battle of Marja. Newman, a regimental commander in Marja, testified last week that he could understand how Golsteyn would have decided to shoot the insurgent.  He was shot after being release from Afghan army custody, according to U.S. Army documents. “Me personally, I’d have made that call,” Newman said, according to the Observer. “I would be obligated to protect my force, the Afghan force and the Afghan population.” Hunter said in a statement Monday that the case has raised troubling questions about how the Army investigates criminal allegations. “For four years, the Army made Matt’s life a living nightmare and the major charges they sought… were unsupported by the evidence,” Hunter said. “Especially considering what the Army tried to do, this is a major victory for Matt and for every soldier in harm’s way, who don’t have the time or the opportunity to litigate split-second battlefield decisions from the rear, sometimes years after the fact even, as the Army did in Matt’s case.” Also related: See document excerpts in the Army’s war-crimes case against Maj.

The Army’s Criminal Investigation Command has reopened its investigation of an Afghanistan war hero who Army officials said confessed to killing an unarmed Taliban detainee. The service is again scrutinizing former Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn after he appeared in a Fox News television interview in October and acknowledged that he had killed a Taliban bombmaker who had been held as a detainee during the bloody battle of Marja in February 2010. The bombmaker was not on a list of targets that U.S. forces had been cleared to kill, according to Army documents; Golsteyn said that letting go of the insurgent meant the Taliban member could later target Afghans who are helping U.S. troops. “You realize quickly that you make things worse,” Golsteyn said in the interview. “It is an inevitable outcome that people who are cooperating with coalition forces, when identified, will suffer some terrible torture or be killed.” Golsteyn first acknowledged killing the detainee during a polygraph test while he was interviewing for a job with the CIA in 2011. A lengthy military probe followed. Army documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act last year show that the service investigated Golsteyn on charges of murder and conspiracy but closed the case after determining that it did not have any evidence to prosecute. The results of his polygraph would not be admissible in court, defense officials said. Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson, an Army spokeswoman, said in a statement that it would be “inappropriate to comment further regarding an ongoing investigation.” A spokesman for Army Criminal Investigation Command, Christopher Grey, declined to comment. Golsteyn said Thursday in an email to The Washington Post that he was “frustrated, but not terribly surprised” that the Army reopened its investigation into his actions. He declined to discuss what happened the day the bombmaker died, but said the Defense Department and Army has “viciously pursued me without a discernible cause or a stated goal for over five years.” Golsteyn led a team from 3rd Special Forces Group, of Fort Bragg, N.C., that had a unit of Marines deployed alongside it during the bloody Battle of Marja in February 2010. Two Marines under his command — Sgt. Jeremy R. McQueary, 27, and Lance Cpl. Larry M. Johnson, 19 — were killed and three more were wounded Feb. 18 after a metal sliding door booby-trapped with explosives detonated. Two days later, Golsteyn watched a Taliban marksman nearly hit another Marine who was manning a rooftop observation post on their base. He launched an 80-man mission to hunt the shooter down, slogging through a muddy field under fire to help a wounded Afghan soldier, returning fire with an antitank weapon, and coordinating repeated airstrikes by F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a Predator drone. He was awarded a Silver Star, the military’s third-highest award for combat valor, and service officials later recommended an upgrade to the more prestigious Distinguished Service Cross. Army documents show that Golsteyn’s unit launched a search for bombmaking supplies in the area after the deaths of Johnson and McQueary, and detained the man Golsteyn confessed to killing. A tribal leader working with the Americans identified the detainee as a member of the Taliban but worried the detainee knew who had singled him out. The tribal leader’s immediate fear: If Golsteyn’s unit let the detainee go, he would kill him and his family. Golsteyn told the CIA during his polygraph test that he trusted the tribal leader and “had no qualms” about killing the detainee “because he couldn’t have lived with himself if [the suspected bombmaker] killed another Soldier or Marine,” Army documents said. During Golestyn’s interview with the CIA, according to investigators, he described taking the bombmaker off the base, shooting him and burying his remains in a shallow grave. Golsteyn added that later that night, he and two other soldiers dug up the remains, brought them back to their base and burned them in a pit used to dispose of trash. Golsteyn and his attorneys have long maintained that the Army’s characterization of events is filled with exaggerations and leaps of logic. No other service members would serve as witnesses against Golsteyn, even when investigators offered immunity from prosecution. Then-Army Secretary John M. McHugh stripped Golsteyn of his valor award in fall 2014, and the Army also revoked his Special Forces tab and reassigned him as a conventional infantry soldier. Golsteyn said in his email to The Post that his case was reopened despite an Army administrative board determining last year that the murder accusation against him was unfounded. The panel did find that Golsteyn demonstrated conduct unbecoming an officer and recommended a general discharge under honorable conditions, ensuring he could keep health benefits. Senior defense officials, Golsteyn said, continue to talk tough about the fight against the Islamic State group while they “mischaracterize my combat actions as ‘murder.'” He compared his case to that of another officer, former 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2013 for ordering his soldiers to open fire on village elders in Afghanistan who were approaching his unit while they were on patrol. Several member of Lorance’s platoon testified against him after being offered immunity. “I am filled with moral disgust that such individuals can continue to wreak such havoc on our warfighters without consequence,” Golsteyn said, adding that he does not regret doing the TV interview because it was important to speak out on how soldiers are restricted in combat. Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R.-Calif.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee who has clashed with the Army repeatedly about Golsteyn’s treatment, said Thursday that he was disgusted with the Army’s decision to reopen the case. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Army’s top officer, and Army Secretary Eric Fanning told Hunter that they cannot stop the investigation at this point, Hunter said. “Matt Golsteyn is an American hero. Matt Golsteyn does for the American people what we ask him to do, and the Army is screwing him again,” Hunter said. “I’m embarrassed for the U.S. Army — and they ought to be embarrassed.” In a letter sent Wednesday to Milley and Fanning, Hunter wrote that they have “the ability to fix this stupidity.” A senior Army official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said a complaint on the Army’s handling of the case has been filed with the Defense Department Inspector General. Until that is resolved, the official said, the case is on hold.

President Obama apologized to Doctors Without Borders on Wednesday for an airstrike that killed 12 aid workers and 10 patients in Afghanistan, even as the White House withheld U.S. support for an international inquiry the relief group says is needed to investigate an attack that may qualify as a war crime. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Obama had spoken by telephone with Joanne Liu, international president of the group also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF, and expressed his condolences for Saturday’s strike in northern Afghanistan. “When we make a mistake, we are honest, own up to it and apologize,” Earnest told reporters at the White House. “The Department of Defense goes to great lengths to prevent civilian casualties, but in this case, there was a mistake, and it’s one that the United States owns up to.” At least 22 people, including three children and 12 Doctors Without Borders staff, were killed overnight on Saturday when an American AC-130 gunship launched repeated attacks on the civilian medical facility in the city of Kunduz, where Afghan forces are battling Taliban fighters who overran the city a week ago. Earnest said that Obama promised Liu a thorough investigation “and if necessary will implement changes to make sure tragedies like this one are less likely in the future.” He declined to say whether the White House would support Liu’s demand for an independent investigation of the incident, but suggested the United States would back only a Pentagon probe now underway, along with separate NATO and Afghan inquiries. MSF, which operates health facilities under difficult conditions across the globe, has insisted the U.S. military cannot conduct a reliable investigation of its own forces’ actions. Liu, speaking earlier in the day at a news briefing in Geneva, said that an independent examination should be conducted by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, a body that was set up in the 1990s under the Geneva Conventions. “The facts and circumstances of this attack must be investigated independently and impartially, particularly given the inconsistencies in the U.S. and Afghan accounts of what happened over recent days,” Liu said. Liu said the proposed commission would gather evidence from the United States, NATO and Afghanistan. After that, the charity would decide whether to seek criminal charges for loss of life and damage. The group has said the attack might be deemed a war crime. “If we let this go, we are basically giving a blank check to any countries at war,” she said. Liu, who spoke prior to the call with Obama, noted there had been no commitments yet on official cooperation with an independent investigation. But U.S. officials said that the United States would be unlikely to take part in an inquiry by the commission. The United States is not a party to the body. “We do participate in some international tribunals and are party to numerous treaties, but when it comes to investigations of our military activities, we do those ourselves,” said John Bellinger III, who was the State Department’s top lawyer from 2005 to 2009. Bellinger said the commission, which has never been activated, may not have the ability to quickly conduct an investigation of this type. “Because accidents or incidents . . . do happen not infrequently, the U.S. government knows how to conduct an investigation” such as the one now taking place. In a statement issued later in the day, Liu acknowledged the call with Obama and reiterated her call for an independent probe to determine “what happened in Kunduz, how it happened, and why it happened.” Obama also spoke on Wednesday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to express condolences for the Afghans killed on Saturday. The president’s personal outreach is one sign of the administration’s concern about what is one of the worst instances of U.S. air power gone astray in Afghanistan in years. On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter promised to hold those responsible accountable, if necessary. The U.S. military rarely, if ever, disciplines individual service members for “collateral damage” or other actions that occur as part of combat. Officials are now scrambling to assemble an accurate account of what happened in Kunduz after their narrative shifted in the initial days following the attack. While military officials initially said the airstrike took place to defend U.S. forces on the ground in Kunduz, the Pentagon later revised its account. They now say the strike came in response to a request from Afghan forces, not U.S. forces, under fire from the Taliban. There are now about 9,800 U.S. troops on the ground as the Obama administration seeks to wind down the long war there. Most are tasked with supporting Afghan forces, who lack key capabilities in intelligence and air power, while a smaller number is dedicated to tracking down militants who threaten the United States. For the most part, U.S. forces are not supposed to be taking part in combat operations against the Taliban, as they did in the years that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. White House officials are considering additional revisions to President Obama’s plan to bring the U.S. military footprint to 1,000 or less by the end of next year. Gen. John F. Campbell, the head of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, has ordered that all forces under his command are trained again in rules of engagement that govern operations in Afghanistan. The Pentagon has not yet said whether Saturday’s strikes violated those rules, which permit the United States to use air power in three situations: for counterterrorism operations, in self-defense or to protect Afghan forces “in extremis.” Ryan reported from Washington and Deane from London. Tim Craig and Sayed Salahuddin in Kabul and David Nakamura and Thomas Gibbons-Neff in Washington contributed to this report.

KABUL — Attacks on health facilities and personnel in Afghanistan have risen 50 percent in the last year, part of a “disturbing trend” that has transformed hospitals and clinics into combat zones in conflicts worldwide, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday. In an interview in the Afghan capital, Kabul, ICRC President Peter Maurer said his organization has witnessed armed groups and other combatants “increasingly shift” toward viewing medical facilities as “strategic areas for warfare.” “I find it very disturbing,” Maurer said, adding that hospitals and war wounded are afforded special protection under international humanitarian law. Maurer was in Afghanistan for a five-day visit. ICRC runs its third-largest humanitarian operation in the country. “We see a pattern in conflict now where medical facilities have become an area of combat.” In Afghanistan — where the United States maintains roughly 10,000 troops — the ICRC each week records about three to four incidents involving attacks on medical facilities or health workers, Maurer said. In 2015, health workers and institutions were subjected to searches by government forces, threats from armed groups, looting and abductions, according to the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). The most devastating attack was in October, when a U.S. AC-130 gunship bombarded a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Kunduz province. The strikes, which took place over several hours, killed 42 people and likely constituted a war crime, the nongovernmental organization said. Last month, elite Afghan special forces summarily executed two patients and a caregiver at a Swedish-run clinic in Wardak province. And in Baghlan province earlier this month, the government raided a local medical NGO and confiscated its equipment, reports said. In all three instances, government officials blamed either the NGOs or the medical facilities for treating patients they said were Taliban fighters. “The fact that soldiers and arms-bearers are getting treatment in medical facilities is now being accepted as an argument to attack those facilities,” Maurer said. The Geneva Conventions, which the ICRC follows, require that war wounded be treated without prejudice, whether or not they participated in the conflict. As such, they are protected from being attacked. Also in Afghanistan, militants loyal to the Islamic State stepped up attacks on health clinics in areas under their control in the east. The jihadists confiscated medicine and equipment and warned medical staff to stop working for the government, according to the United Nations. Despite these attacks, the ICRC has been in contact with Islamic State fighters in eastern Afghanistan to negotiate access to the local population. “While a couple of years ago, we could safely say this is a conflict between the Taliban and the government, it is now more multifaceted,” Maurer said, referring to the rise of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. “We see that the conflict has now spread all over the country,” he said. “But it’s not getting much attention.” Read more: Top U.S. general in Afghanistan: Hospital was ‘mistakenly struck’ Doctors Without Borders says U.S. airstrike hit hospital in Afghanistan; at least 19 dead	681	26	660	2023-04-20T12:14:49.948883Z	2023-04-20T12:14:49.948983Z	284.682	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 293, ""text"": ""KABUL — Attacks on health facilities and personnel in Afghanistan have risen 50 percent in the last year, part of a “disturbing trend” that has transformed hospitals and clinics into combat zones in conflicts worldwide, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 793, ""end"": 1086, ""text"": ""“We see a pattern in conflict now where medical facilities have become an area of combat.” In Afghanistan — where the United States maintains roughly 10,000 troops — the ICRC each week records about three to four incidents involving attacks on medical facilities or health workers, Maurer said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1088, ""end"": 1576, ""text"": ""In 2015, health workers and institutions were subjected to searches by government forces, threats from armed groups, looting and abductions, according to the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).

The bombardment that struck a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan was requested by an Army Special Forces unit that apparently knew that the structure was a hospital but believed it was under Taliban control, according to an Associated Press report. The report, released Monday and citing a number of anonymous sources, also indicated that the hospital’s location was well-circulated to U.S. forces and that, in the days prior to the attack, U.S. officials had confronted Doctors Without Borders about the Taliban’s presence in their facility. Doctors Without Borders have denied that Taliban fighters had seized the facility. “The hospital was under the control of [Doctors Without Borders]. Our staff reported no armed combatants or fighting in the compound prior to the airstrike,” said Tim Shenk, a Doctors Without Borders spokesman, in an email. [Kunduz faces tough resurrection after brief Taliban takeover] Pentagon spokesman Army Maj. Roger Cabiness, did not dispute the AP’s report, but wrote in an email that there are still multiple ongoing investigations and that “it would be premature to draw any conclusions before those investigations are complete.” Even with the apparent coordination and knowledge of the facility, a prominent one-story building towards the south of the city, a U.S. AC-130U gunship from 4th Special Operations Squadron targeted and fired upon the facility with a combination of 25mm and 40mm cannon as well as a 105mm howitzer in the early hours of Oct. 3rd. According to those on the ground, the strike lasted for almost an hour and involved four distinct passes from the aircraft. AC-130’s traditionally circle their targets in a wide orbit, banking continuously to the left in order to align their weapon systems. The AC-130 is known as a premier close air support platform and more often than not operate as attachments to special operation teams. The attack, according to new reports from Doctors Without Borders, left 30 dead and resulted in the shuttering of the hospital. According to those familiar with the incident, the crew of the AC-130, call sign Hammer, verified their permission to fire twice before engaging the hospital. AC-130Us carry a crew of 14, often including a special forces liaison officer responsible for communicating with ground units. While it is still unclear who relayed the initial call for an airstrike, according to U.S. officials, the request came from an Afghan special forces unit that was pinned down by Taliban fire. The request was then relayed to the Joint Operations Command manned by soldiers from the Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group and their Afghan counterparts located south of the city near the Kunduz airport. The JOC then directed the AC-130 to the vicinity of the hospital where the AC-130 identified Taliban fighters firing from the hospital grounds. From there the JOC authorized the AC-130 to fire. [By evening, a hospital. By morning, a war zone.] AC-130s operate with a variety of infared and low-light sensors that allow them to see almost everything on the battlefield below, albeit not in color. In order for the aircraft to fire, it must locate the friendly forces it is supporting before engaging enemy targets. Though there are now various accounts circulating about what happened that night, it is still unknown who talked to the aircraft and when. Was there an American combat controller embedded with the Afghan forces talking to the AC-130? Or was the aircraft only talking to American special forces soldiers located at the command center nowhere near the battle? Another important question raised by the hospital bombardment is whether the U.S. government can be charged with war crimes for knowingly targeting a hospital — something that Doctors Without Borders has repeatedly accused U.S. forces of doing. According to the Law of Armed Conflict and the Army field manual of the law of land warfare, “Medical units/establishments lose protection if committing ‘acts harmful to the enemy.’ Acts harmful to the enemy are not only acts of warfare proper, but also any activity characterizing combatant action, such as setting up observation posts, or the use of the hospital as a liaison center for fighting troops.” The Law of Armed Conflict also notes that even if a hospital is being used in a manner which voids its protected status that “protection ceases only after a warning has been given, and it remains unheeded after a reasonable time to comply.” [From ‘collateral damage’ to ‘deeply regrets’: How the Pentagon has shifted on the Afghan hospital attack] So in this case, even if the Taliban had been using the hospital, the United States could still possibly be at the same level of fault regardless of the Taliban’s presence. While Doctors Without Borders had called for an external investigation into the incident, the Pentagon is still conducting one of its own that has yet to be released. “My intent is to disclose the findings of the investigation once it is complete,” said Gen. John Campbell, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in an emailed statement Saturday. “We will be forthright and transparent and we will hold ourselves accountable for any mistakes made. While we desire the investigation to be timely, what’s most important is that it be done thoroughly and correctly.”	680	26	659	2023-04-20T12:10:01.712907Z	2023-04-20T12:10:01.712995Z	23.781	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 268, ""text"": ""mbardment that struck a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan was requested by an Army Special Forces unit that apparently knew that the structure was a hospital but believed it was under Taliban control, according to an Associated Press report"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 270, ""end"": 562, ""text"": ""he report, released Monday and citing a number of anonymous sources, also indicated that the hospital’s location was well-circulated to U.S. forces and that, in the days prior to the attack, U.S. officials had confronted Doctors Without Borders about the Taliban’s presence in their facility"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1186, ""end"": 1514, ""text"": ""Even with the apparent coordination and knowledge of the facility, a prominent one-story building towards the south of the city, a U.S. AC-130U gunship from 4th Special Operations Squadron targeted and fired upon the facility with a combination of 25mm and 40mm cannon as well as a 105mm howitzer in the early hours of Oct. 3rd."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1908, ""end"": 2035, ""text"": ""The attack, according to new reports from Doctors Without Borders, left 30 dead and resulted in the shuttering of the hospital."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3588, ""end"": 3832, ""text"": ""nother important question raised by the hospital bombardment is whether the U.S. government can be charged with war crimes for knowingly targeting a hospital — something that Doctors Without Borders has repeatedly accused U.S. forces of doing."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3588, ""end"": 3831, ""text"": ""Another important question raised by the hospital bombardment is whether the U.S. government can be charged with war crimes for knowingly targeting a hospital — something that Doctors Without Borders has repeatedly accused U.S. forces of doing"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
KUNDUZ, AFGHANISTAN — A deadly U.S. airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital last month has triggered an international outcry and investigations by the Pentagon and NATO. But it was not the only U.S. aerial assault during the battle to cause significant damage in this northern city. Hours earlier, U.S. warplanes zeroed in on a warehouse and a mansion in two densely populated residential areas, according to witnesses and local officials. No one was killed in those attacks, but the targets were pulverized and the walls and windows of nearby homes were shattered. All three U.S. strikes — on the warehouse, the mansion and the hospital — were requested by Afghan commanders, who say they asked for help because their forces were under attack by Taliban fighters. But residents said that while their neighborhoods had been conflict zones earlier, there were no militants at any of the locations at the time of the attacks. The clinic bombardment, on Oct. 3, killed 30 medical staff members and patients in one of the deadliest civilian casualty incidents stemming from a coalition action in the Afghan conflict. Together, the three attacks raise questions about the quality and reliability of the intelligence that Afghan security forces are providing to their American partners, as well as U.S. decisions to act on that intelligence. The target of every Afghan request for air support has to be independently verified by American military advisers before it is approved, according to U.S. rules of engagement. Fourteen years after the U.S. intervention toppled the Taliban regime, intelligence gathering and coordination between U.S. and Afghan forces remain a major challenge. Faulty information and communication have been behind numerous civilian casualty incidents, as well as “friendly fire” attacks. Now, investigators are examining how an American AC-130 gunship could bomb a hospital for more than an hour. “Did U.S. forces fire based solely on intelligence from Afghan troops? Did the U.S. identify and confirm the targets independently?” the watchdog group Human Rights Watch asked as it called for “a credible, independent and transparent investigation that provides genuine accountability.” The two other airstrikes add grist to the concerns over intelligence. The Oct. 2 attacks on the warehouse and mansion, which housed a local government administrative office, have not been previously disclosed by U.S. authorities. American forces “conducted three airstrikes in the vicinity of Kunduz city” on Oct. 2 in an effort “to eliminate threats to coalition and Afghan forces,” a U.S. military official acknowledged, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of military protocol. The official said he could not discuss the specific targets of that day or the methods used to select targets. The head of the Afghan police special forces, who worked with American combat advisers here, said the two targets were struck by American warplanes. In the case of the mansion, in a densely populated urban area, the strike obliterated a neighboring house and severely damaged others. “It was a very big mistake,” said Haji Fazhul Rahman, a businessman, as he walked through the charred debris of his four-story home. Taliban fighters had looted the mansion next door, he said, but then left — a day before the American airstrike. With U.S. efforts to rebuild Afghanistan’s air force challenged by a lack of modern aircraft and trained personnel, American warplanes and drones have become the primary way to help this nation’s beleaguered army and police fight an emboldened Taliban. That makes it crucial that legitimate targets are chosen to prevent civilian casualties and a backlash against U.S. forces, particularly as the insurgents are increasingly targeting urban areas. The number of airstrikes has steadily risen since spring, U.S. military data shows, though it is well below levels before the U.S. combat mission officially ended last December. The deployment of U.S. air power is expected to continue with President Obama’s recent decision to keep 5,500 U.S. troops in the country past next year. But intelligence gathering, by both Afghans and U.S. forces, has been problematic. Under former president Hamid Karzai, American Special Operation forces were heavily criticized for lack of communication and coordination with Afghan forces. Over the years, hundreds of civilians have been killed in airstrikes. In July, a U.S. airstrike killed eight Afghan soldiers in Logar province, which the provincial governor and Afghan military commanders described as “a mistake” caused by poor communication and coordination. In the Kunduz hospital attack, two U.S. military investigations underway will “look at a series of potential human errors, failures of process and technical malfunctions that may have contributed” to the decision to attack, said Brig. Gen. Wilson Shoffner, the top U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan. Doctors Without Borders has described the attack as a possible war crime and has called for an independent inquiry. Shoffner, in an interview in the Afghan capital, expressed concern generally over the solidity of Afghan intelligence. “Afghan intel is one of their gaps that we’re going to have to continue to work with them on for years to come,” he said. “It’s critically important.” Dawlat Waziri, an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman, said Afghan forces were trying their best to give their U.S. partners “accurate information” when requesting airstrikes. But he added that the U.S. military also bears responsibility because “all this information is being analyzed by the Americans” before launching an attack. In the case of the hospital attack, he disputed Gen. John F. Campbell, the U.S. military’s top commander, who said the strike was triggered by a request from Afghan forces facing a Taliban attack. Their request, Waziri said, was to strike Taliban fighters who had taken positions around the hospital. “We never told the Americans to hit the hospital,” Waziri said. “An investigation is underway, and it will reveal the truth.” Other Afghan officials, however, contend that insurgents were using the trauma facility as a base. “The Taliban was attacking from the hospital,” said Hamdullah Danishi, the provincial governor, claiming there were 300 insurgents inside. “They were opening fire on our soldiers.” Doctors Without Borders has denied that armed rebels were inside its facility or that fighting was occurring around its compound at the time of the attack. But a senior Afghan official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid, said he was “glad” that the hospital was bombed, because “they treated hundreds of Taliban there.” The hospital had been targeted before. In July, Afghan soldiers stormed the facility searching for wounded Taliban fighters and beat up some staff members, the medical aid group said at the time. The fighting in Kunduz took place in a complex battlefield environment. Afghan security forces, and their American combat advisers, had not fought inside a densely populated area since the Taliban regime collapsed, and they had never had to wrest a city back from the insurgents. Taliban fighters were moving quickly from building to building. Calling in an airstrike in such a situation was far more risky than in rural areas. “Even if there is a difference of a millimeter in the coordinates, you get the wrong target,” said Atiqullah Amarkhil, a retired Afghan army general and a military analyst. Several hours before the hospital attack, an Afghan special forces unit had asked its U.S. Special Operations advisers to launch airstrikes on the warehouse and the mansion, said Lt. Col. Abdullah Guard, the head of the Afghan police special forces in Kunduz, who worked with the American advisers. The warehouse was used by a company called Alokozay, a distributor of tea and soft drinks. The mansion served as an administrative office to deal with foreign visas and other issues. “There were huge numbers of Taliban inside the Alokozay warehouse, huge numbers of Taliban inside the MSF hospital, and huge numbers of Taliban inside the foreign office,” Guard said. “We gave all this information to our foreign allies. We were begging them to launch the airstrikes.” Witnesses, including a guard who was in a corner of the warehouse compound when the attack unfolded, said there were no Taliban fighters inside. There had been clashes between Taliban and Afghan forces in the neighborhood around the time of the attack, with the insurgents firing from the roofs of houses and quickly melting away, witnesses said. “When the airplane came, it couldn’t distinguish where the Taliban were located,” said Abdul Wali, 30, a guard at a medical clinic behind the warehouse who witnessed the attack. He said he saw five or six Taliban fighters on the street and in nearby buildings. “But there was none firing from the warehouse.” Rahman, the businessman who lived next to the mansion, had fled with his family hours before the attack there destroyed his home. As his son, Elham Rahmani, inspected the ruins, he had mixed emotions about the U.S. military’s actions in Kunduz. On one hand, he said, the airstrikes demolished his home and the only trauma hospital in the region. On the other hand, the attacks stopped the Taliban from reaching the airport, where Afghan soldiers and police had retreated when the insurgents seized the city. “Or else,” said Rahmani, “the whole province would have fallen to them.” Read more: Afghans who once watched war from afar forced to flee as front lines shift In Taliban-held Kunduz, echoes of a 1988 guerrilla assault after the Soviets withdrew The bloody history of Kunduz, from Afghanistan’s ‘Convoy of Death’ to now Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world	679	26	647	2023-04-18T13:20:25.507454Z	2023-04-19T22:10:50.694591Z	1335.052	"[{""start"": 22, ""end"": 176, ""text"": ""A deadly U.S. airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital last month has triggered an international outcry and investigations by the Pentagon and NATO"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 178, ""end"": 771, ""text"": ""But it was not the only U.S. aerial assault during the battle to cause significant damage in this northern city.

One key reason Donald Trump’s presidency has been so damaging is that he has a way of corrupting all the people and institutions he comes in contact with, infecting them with his virus. No one remains untouched. As the sudden firing of Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer shows, that includes the military. Spencer’s story also bears a remarkable resemblance to the Ukraine scandal, in the way people with their own agendas played on Trump’s most repugnant impulses to manipulate him. Spencer’s firing has its roots in the case of Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who became a Fox News hero. Gallagher’s long and complicated case began when members of his own unit accused him of a series of war crimes, including firing on civilians and murdering a wounded teenage Islamic State fighter receiving medical treatment from his unit. Gallagher allegedly stabbed the wounded fighter multiple times, then took a picture with his corpse and texted it to friends, with the caption “Got him with my hunting knife.” He was also charged with covering up his crime by threatening to kill members of his platoon if they reported it. They did anyway. Gallagher’s trial was a chaotic mess marred by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct and a witness who abruptly changed his story on the stand. In the end, Gallagher was acquitted of murder but convicted of posing with the corpse, a violation of the laws of war. Then Trump pardoned him, along with two other servicemembers who had also been accused of war crimes. Those pardons generated enormous controversy both inside and outside the military, but they were not surprising. From the time he began running for president, Trump has shown nothing but contempt for ideas like military order and discipline, respect for human rights and standards of wartime conduct. He has advocated torturing detainees, suggested that a way to fight terrorism would be to murder the families of suspected terrorists and mused about committing genocide. Accused war criminals are his kind of people. Which those advocating on their behalf understood — just as Rudolph W. Giuliani and his goons understood that the way to get Trump to fire the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was to tell him that she wasn’t loyal to him. While the details of the Gallagher case are complex, what we know is that after Trump’s pardon, the Navy began a formal review to determine if Gallagher should be stripped of his Trident pin, removing his status as a member of the SEALs. Trump then tweeted, “The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin,” effectively saying he didn’t care what the service’s procedures were or what its inquiry found, he was going to overrule them. It appears Secretary Spencer was attempting to find some kind of compromise; according to the Pentagon, he suggested to the White House that if the president allowed the inquiry to go forward, he would permit Gallagher to retire with his status as a SEAL intact. This proposal then became the stated justification for Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper to fire Spencer. In a striking letter to the president, Spencer wrote that “The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries,” then went on to say this: While Spencer is Trump’s appointee and not a career civil servant, you can’t help but hear the echoes of the many national security and foreign policy professionals who testified in the impeachment inquiry. They believed their purpose was to advance the interests of the United States, in keeping with the Constitution and the values we seek to uphold and spread. Then they discovered to their dismay that policy was being propelled instead by Trump’s personal interests. Spencer seemed to get caught in the same tension. And here’s the important context to understand how this all happened: Just as Giuliani and others used Fox News as a tool to spread misinformation on Ukraine, those advocating for Gallagher and other accused war criminals have used Fox as a direct pipeline to Trump to plead their case and convince him to issue pardons. Fox host Pete Hegseth has been their most aggressive cheerleader, but family members, lawyers and sometimes the accused themselves have made regular appearances on the network. In fact, after Spencer was fired, Gallagher quickly went on Fox to praise Trump and attack his superior officers in the Navy, an extraordinary thing for someone on active duty to do. Or at least it was extraordinary before Trump became president. “If you set this sort of precedent, then how do you tell the next SEAL that is up on charges not to go public, not to try to undermine their superiors, not to try to change a military judgment and make it a political one?” asked Ray Mabus, secretary of the Navy under Barack Obama. It’s a good question. From the moment he took office, Trump related to the military in ways completely at odds with how other presidents, Democrat and Republican, had conducted themselves. He regularly talks about “my generals” and “my military” as though they are his personal property. He goes in front of military audiences and gives overtly political speeches bashing the opposition party. Likewise, Trump twisted U.S. foreign policy into a means to help him get reelected. There might be some small agencies here and there in the federal government that have resisted the Trump virus and continue to operate with the same integrity and commitment to their mission they had before he became president. But if there are, it’s only because he hasn’t gotten around to corrupting them yet.

A heavily armed U.S. gunship designed to provide added firepower to Special Operations forces was responsible for shooting and killing 22 people at a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, over the weekend, Pentagon officials said Monday. The attack occurred in the middle of the night Saturday, when Afghan troops and a U.S. Special Forces team training and advising them were on the ground near the hospital in Kunduz, the first major Afghan city to fall to the Taliban since the war began in 2001. The top U.S. general in Afghanistan said Monday the airstrike was requested by Afghan troops who had come under fire, contradicting earlier statements from Pentagon officials that the strike was ordered to protect U.S. forces on the ground. [Afghan response to hospital bombing is muted, even sympathetic] The new details, and the continuing dispute over what exactly happened, heightened the controversy over the strike. In the two days since the incident, U.S. officials have struggled to explain how a U.S. aircraft wound up attacking a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders. On Monday, the medical humanitarian group said the United States was squarely responsible. “The reality is the U.S. dropped those bombs,” Christopher Stokes, general director of Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement. “With such constant discrepancies in the U.S. and Afghan accounts of what happened, the need for a full transparent independent investigation is ever more critical.” The weekend’s disastrous airstrike reinforces doubts about how effectively a limited U.S. force in Afghanistan can work with Afghan troops to repel the Taliban, which has been newly emboldened as the United States draws down its presence. The strike also comes as the Obama administration is weighing whether to keep as many as 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan beyond 2015, according to senior officials. Obama has not made a final decision on the proposal, but the recent advances by the Taliban have certainly complicated the president’s calculus. Army Gen. John Campbell, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told reporters Monday at a news conference that Afghan forces “advised that they were taking fire from enemy positions and asked for air support from U.S. forces.” Campbell made it clear that this differed from initial reports that said U.S. forces were under attack and called in the airstrikes for their defense. Campbell’s remarks differed from two previous comments, including one made by Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter on Sunday that said U.S. forces were under attack. “At some point in the course of the events there [they] did report that they, themselves, were coming under attack. That much I think we can safely say,” Carter told reporters Sunday. Abdul Qahar Aram, spokesman for the Afghan army’s 209th Corps in northern Afghanistan, said he could not comment on the specifics of Saturday’s hospital bombing. But Aram said there was a “strong possibility” that Afghan forces had requested it. A spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had no immediate comment on Campbell’s statement. One aspect of the strike that remained unclear Monday was the exact role played by U.S. forces accompanying the Afghans that night. After Kunduz was overrun with Taliban fighters late last month, American Special Operations forces were ferried in to shore up Afghan forces that were making little headway in the fight to retake the populated city center. Together, the U.S. and Afghan forces have been able to retake nearly all of the city. These “train, advise and assist” missions are a staple of U.S. Special Forces capabilities and have been conducted extensively in recent years. In combat situations, rather than return fire, U.S. troops on these missions are more likely to help direct communication, casualty evacuation and direct air support from an AC-130, for instance, if it is available. As a result, there has been little direct contact between U.S. troops and the Taliban since most U.S. forces were relegated to the sidelines when official combat operations ended last year. [Afghans who once watched war from afar forced to flee as front lines shift] The aircraft that carried out the weekend attack was an AC-130 gunship, according to Campbell. Unlike jets, the AC-130 is a unique aircraft dedicated almost entirely to supporting Special Operations forces. In order to make sure targeting and communication from the ground to the aircraft is as seamless as possible, every AC-130 flies with a liaison officer who has spent time as a Special Forces soldier on the ground. While most jets streak across a target, moving quickly while dropping bombs or firing cannons or machine guns, the AC-130 essentially loiters over a target at around 7,000 feet, flying in a circle and firing from weapons ports mounted on the aircraft’s left side. Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, an AC-130 is requested differently. While a jet requires a map coordinate to engage its target, the AC-130 relies on direction (a compass heading) and a distance to the enemy target from the friendly forces engaged on the ground. In short, it relies on visual targeting. This difference might explain why the hospital was targeted even though Doctors Without Borders said it had given U.S. and Afghan forces its map coordinates before. “It’s a visual acuity aircraft,” said a U.S. close-air support pilot who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his active-duty status. “An AC-130 finds the friendly force, then fires over their left or right shoulder.” The pilot went on to add that an AC-130 does not enter enemy airspace and look for targets. It specifically has to be guided onto the target by a force on the ground and will fire only after identifying friendly and enemy forces, he said. The aircraft, because of its large profile and the fact that it operates at low altitude, flies close air support missions only at night. Since it only works in the dark, the crew of roughly a dozen uses a number of infrared sensors and night vision devices to see and engage targets on the ground. According to Navy Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a Pentagon spokeswoman, there have been 12 U.S. airstrikes around the city of Kunduz since Sep. 29. The airstrike on the Doctors Without Borders hospital was the second strike within the city. It now ranks among one of the most high-profile U.S. strikes to result in civilian casualties in Afghanistan. In July 2002, a U.S. AC-130 fired on a wedding party, killing more than 40 and injuring more than 100 people in northern Helmand province. Since Saturday’s attack, Doctors Without Borders has left Kunduz. Tim Craig in Kabul contributed to this report.

KABUL — Afghan security forces raided a charitable health clinic in Wardak province Wednesday night, killing two patients and a caretaker in another incident billed as a potential war crime here, according to the human rights organization that operates the clinic. The Swedish Committee for Afghanistan said in a statement that the Afghan National Army had conducted the raid, calling the attack “a gross violation of humanitarian principles and the Geneva Convention.” Bjorn Lindh, a spokesman for the group, said Afghan troops arrived near the 10-bed clinic in a helicopter about 11 p.m. Initially, he said, they went to the home of a local ambulance driver and detained him. The ambulance driver then escorted the soldiers to the health clinic. The troops stormed into the clinic and began arresting and beating staff members, Lindh said, adding that they then “found two patients who were injured in some way.” “They took these people out of the clinic to a nearby bazaar and killed them,” Lindh said. A 15-year-old boy who had been watching over the two men was also killed, he said. A spokesman for the Defense Ministry did not return several calls for comment. Some local officials in Wardak, south of Kabul, alleged that U.S. forces were also involved in the raid, perhaps flying the helicopters that transported Afghan security personnel to the area. Col. Michael T. Lawhorn, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, said officials are investigating those claims. “We are aware of those reports, and we are looking into them,” Lawhorn said. Gen. Razeq Safi, commander of an Afghan army brigade for Logar and Wardak provinces, said that four Taliban insurgents were killed and two others wounded during the incident. Another insurgent was also taken in custody, he said. But Safi denied that the Afghan army had conducted the raid, saying he suspects Afghan police special forces carried it out in cooperation with “foreign troops.” “Choppers were seen last night,” Safi said. “Airstrikes have also taken place there.” An official with the Afghan Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said the agency did conduct operations in Wardak on Wednesday night but declined to comment on whether they took place near the health clinic. The apparent raid comes less than six months after U.S. Special Forces mistakenly strafed a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz in northern Afghanistan, killing at least 42 patients, medical staffers and caretakers. President Obama apologized for that airstrike, but Doctors Without Borders is pressing for war crimes charges to be filed. Gen. John Campbell, the outgoing commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, blamed “human error” for the Kunduz strike. Campbell said U.S. Special Forces who had been operating in that area had not been briefed that the Doctors Without Borders compound was a hospital. Afghan security forces, however, have been known to routinely enter medical facilities in pursuit of militants, even though hospitals are considered neutral spaces under international law. A few months before the hospital in Kunduz was bombed, Doctors Without Borders complained that Afghan troops had illegally entered the facility. A report released Sunday by the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan noted that coalition and Afghan special forces raided health facilities in Logar and Helmand provinces in December. The report said the search operations “resulted in the arrest of healthcare staff and destruction of clinic equipment — although they did not cause any civilian casualties.” Jorgen Holmstrom, the country director for the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, said all the patients in the group’s clinics had the right to be protected. “Medical facilities and medical staff are to provide treatment to anyone in need, and patients are to be granted safety according to humanitarian law,” he said. Lindh noted that the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan is the only medical provider in Wardak province, where fierce battles between Afghan security forces and Taliban militants are common. Abdul Wali Noorzai, a spokesman for the provincial police force, said the raid began when Afghan special forces used ropes to descend into the village from a helicopter. “The operation was conducted at night, and Afghans do not have the technology to do it by air, lowering troops onto the ground,” he said. “I think Americans were present with them.” U.S. military officials say the Afghan army sometimes uses its own helicopters now to conduct night operations, without the presence of coalition advisers. Hameeda Akbari, a member of parliament from the area, said the hospital was well-known for treating Taliban militants. She called the raid “justifiable.” “That hospital treats the opposition,” Akbari said. But Lindh stressed that the staff at the health clinic “is not part of this conflict.” “Anyone who comes to our clinics, we don’t ask questions, and they should feel protected,” Lindh said. “But they were taken out, and they were killed.” Mohammad Sharif in Kabul and Dan Lamothe in Washington contributed to this report.

President Trump is expected to intervene in three military justice cases involving service members charged with war crimes any day, issuing pardons or otherwise clearing them of wrongdoing and preventing the U.S. military from bringing the same charges again, three U.S. officials said Thursday. White House and Pentagon officials have been working out the details for days, said the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The details were not all clear but are expected to involve executive clemency, in which Trump can pardon someone or shorten a prison sentence through commutation. The actions have been anticipated by U.S. officials and advocates for the service members for weeks, and decried by some military justice experts for what they see as a subversion of the legal process. Senior U.S. military officials also have registered their concern with the administration that the president intervening could undermine good order and discipline, said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the experts and military officials also acknowledge that, as commander in chief, Trump has broad authority in the cases to act as he sees fit. Some observers thought that Trump might announce his decision during a “Keep America Great” rally in Louisiana on Thursday night, but that did not occur. U.S. officials said they will be watching his Twitter account for an announcement on Friday, but added that he could publicize them later, or one at a time. A Pentagon official, asked about the case, referred comment to recent remarks made by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper. Esper acknowledged last week speaking with the president about the issue but declined to share his personal opinion. “I do have full confidence in the military justice system and we’ll let things play out as they play out,” Esper said. “I offered ― as I do in all matters ― the facts, the options, my advice, the recommendations and we’ll see how things play out.” The cases include that of Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, a former Special Forces officer who faces a murder trial in the 2010 death of a suspected Taliban bombmaker; former Special Warfare Operator Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who recently was acquitted of murder but convicted of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State militant; and former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2013 and is serving a 19-year prison sentence for ordering his soldiers to open fire on three men in Afghanistan. Golsteyn faces a court-martial that is scheduled for February. He first came under investigation in 2011 after he applied for a job with the CIA and disclosed during a polygraph test that he had killed someone on deployment and burned the body, according to Army documents and a Washington Post interview with Golsteyn in February. Golsteyn said he killed the suspected bombmaker in an ambush after he had been detained and crossed paths on base with a tribal elder working with U.S. forces. U.S. troops were required to set the detainee free, he said, prompting fears that he would kill the elder. Golsteyn contends the ambush of the man, who was unarmed at the time, was legal. Gallagher was tried by the Navy in a case over the summer that fell apart after another SEAL in his unit testified in court that he had actually killed a wounded Islamic State detainee in Iraq at the center of the case. Gallagher was convicted instead of taking a photograph with an Islamic State member’s corpse and demoted one rank to petty officer first class. He has sought his old rank reinstated as he retires, said his attorney, Tim Parlatore. Lorance was convicted of second-degree murder in 2013 after nine members of his unit testified against him, and has been imprisoned for the past six years at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Lorance’s supporters have argued that Army prosecutors in his case hid details, including that biometrics showed the men were affiliated with the Taliban. The U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals found in 2017 that the information would not have been permitted at a new trial. One concern in the Pentagon about the Lorance case is whether he is allowed to return to serving as an Army officer. That was not clear as of Thursday, two officials with knowledge of his case said. Trump has raised questions about the prosecution of the Golsteyn and Gallagher cases previously, and all three service members have received extensive media coverage, especially in the conservative media. In October, Trump tweeted that the case of Golsteyn was “under review” at the White House. Golsteyn, who earned a Silver Star for valor in Afghanistan that was later revoked by the Army, is “a highly decorated Green Beret who is being tried for killing a Taliban bombmaker,” Trump said. “We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!” he tweeted. In March, Trump ordered the Navy to remove Gallagher from pretrial confinement in prison, and celebrated when he was acquitted of murder in July. “Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, his wonderful wife Andrea, and his entire family,” Trump tweeted. “You have been through much together. Glad I could help!” Trump also directed the Navy to rescind Navy Achievement Medals that Navy prosecutors received in the Gallagher prosecution, tweeting that “not only did they lose the case,” they had offered immunity to Gallagher’s fellow SEALs in “totally incompetent fashion.” The action follows Trump pardoning another veteran, former 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, in May in the 2008 murder of an Iraqi prisoner suspected of being a member of al-Qaeda. Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder and sentenced to 25 years after stripping a detainee naked, interrogating him without authorization and shooting him twice. Behenna said he was acting in self-defense and that the detainee made a move for the officer’s pistol.	675	26	651	2023-04-18T13:20:43.882295Z	2023-04-19T16:02:26.692447Z	369.435	"[{""start"": 2006, ""end"": 2543, ""text"": ""The cases include that of Army Maj.

A Pentagon investigation into a 2015 airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan found that the failures that led to the disaster did not amount to a war crime because they were not intentional, Army Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, said Friday. The Pentagon said it disciplined 16 service members involved in the attack, which killed at least 30 people, including medical staff and patients. The U.S. troops involved did not know they were striking a medical facility, Votel said, and their punishments ranged from formal counseling to letters of reprimand. “They were trying to do the right thing. They were trying to support our Afghan partners,” said Votel. “Unfortunately, they made a wrong judgment in this particular case and ended up targeting this Doctors Without Borders facility.” Five service members, including a general officer, were removed from Afghanistan. None of the 16 service members have faced court-martial. The Oct. 3 incident, which Votel called a “tragedy,” illuminates the downsides of the U.S. strategy of fighting at arm’s length, rather than committing a large ground presence. Teaming up with local counterparts, backed by U.S. air power and Special Operations troops, still presents pitfalls. In this case, the Pentagon investigation showed there was a widespread breakdown in procedures and communication. And according to the investigation, in the days leading up to the attack, some Special Operations troops felt they had no sense of what they were trying to accomplish as they fought to retake the northern Afghanistan city of Kunduz, which had been unexpectedly seized by the Taliban. One officer, whose name, rank and unit were redacted from his witness statement, blamed senior leaders for the fiasco, saying there was a “profound lack of strategy” during the multi-day battle. Army Green Berets on the ground in the city at the time asked for guidance “no fewer than three times” during the battle and heard nothing but crickets — “though those were hard to hear over the gunfire,” he alleged. The officer also questioned the U.S. strategy of pulling most U.S. troops back almost entirely onto large bases that they rarely leave, rather than taking a more active approach as in years past. “If someone must be held accountable,” he concluded, “let it not be the man who was ordered to sky-dive without being given a parachute.” According to investigation documents released Friday, the Oct. 3 attack on the hospital was the final event in a breakdown of communication among a number of units on the ground and in the sky. These failures led to the hospital being misidentified as a Taliban command center, the report said. U.S. Special Forces had requested an AC-130, a lumbering four-engine aircraft armed with a 40mm and 20mm cannon, along with a 105 mm howitzer, to support Afghan forces as they attacked a Taliban compound in the dark of night. As the AC-130 headed toward its intended target, another issue quickly surfaced. A key piece of equipment — a device that transmitted secure video footage from the aircraft to a Special Forces soldier on the ground guiding the aircraft and talking to the pilot — failed. With this device not working, the soldier was not able to see what the aircrew was looking at on the ground, removing a key link between the ground and the air. To make things even more confusing, the Special Forces soldier was at a nearby headquarters, miles from the site of the attack, according to Votel. There were no American forces with their Afghan counterparts. As the AC-130 arrived over Kunduz it was targeted by a Taliban surface-to-air missile, according to Votel, forcing the aircraft to alter its course. The Special Forces soldier then proceeded to direct the aircraft to its target using verbal commands to verify that the crew was looking at the intended Taliban command center. Records of conversations show that there was some hesi­ta­tion among the aircrew about the information being transmitted to them, the investigation found. After a series of miscommunications, the soldier thought he had directed the AC-130 to the Taliban compound. In reality, however, the soldier had the aircraft’s crew pointing their cannons at the Doctors Without Borders hospital, a quarter-mile from the Taliban’s facility. At this point, there still needed to be an authorization by the American ground commander to fire. Under the rules of engagement, an airstrike is authorized only if it’s meant to protect U.S. forces and their allies. The commander said he heard machine-gun fire in the area, so he authorized the strike. In fact, the compound showed no signs of hostile acts or intent that would justify a strike, and so the commander violated the rules of engagement, according to the investigation. At approximately 2:08 a.m., the AC-130 began firing, using a mixture of its weapon systems. At the time, Afghan forces were more than five miles from their intended target, according to the report. So there were no forces on the ground to determine whether the gunship was hitting the right building. Doctors Without Borders staff began frantically trying to reach U.S. commanders to tell them to stop the attack. Exactly 30 minutes after the strike began, the AC-130 ceased firing, after the U.S. ground commander was informed through “multiple echelons of command” that the aircraft was targeting the hospital. Doctors Without Borders says at least 42 people were killed, though the Pentagon’s report notes that the number has not been independently verified. Following the attack, the United States has provided more than 170 individuals and families with condolence payments, including $6,000 to family members of those killed. U.S. forces have also revised their target procedures, according to Votel, and have ensured that facilities like hospitals are included on a “no strike list” loaded onto aircraft systems. John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, called the punishments announced Friday an “insult to the dead.” “The Pentagon public affairs office can try to spin ‘counseling’ and ‘letters of reprimand’ as devastating and career-ending for implicated personnel,” Sifton said. “But the attack ended people’s very lives, and devastated the families and survivors of those who were killed.” The president of Doctors Without Borders, Meinie Nicolai, said in a statement that “today’s briefing amounts to an admission of an uncontrolled military operation in a densely populated urban area, during which US forces failed to follow the basic laws of war. It is incomprehensible that, under the circumstances described by the US, the attack was not called off.” Read more: Afghan response to hospital bombing is muted, even sympathetic Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan: The world’s most-needed hospitals are under attack  	673	26	653	2023-04-18T13:20:49.384844Z	2023-04-19T15:51:51.399108Z	47.976	"[{""start"": 1780, ""end"": 2071, ""text"": ""saying there was a “profound lack of strategy” during the multi-day battle.

Last summer, days into a new assignment leading a platoon in a volatile patch of southern Afghanistan, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army asked one of his soldiers to open fire on two Afghan men on motorcycles. The fatal shots set in motion an extraordinary criminal investigation that unfolded largely unnoticed until a jury at Fort Bragg, N.C., this week heard dramatically different accounts of the choices that the officer, Clint Lorance, made that day. On Thursday evening, jurors convicted the 28-year-old Lorance of murder, siding with prosecutors who portrayed his order as a reckless contravention of the rules of engagement. Lorance’s supporters say the real crime was the military’s decision to turn a war hero deployed in one of the most dangerous and remote corners of Afghanistan into a defendant. “To put murder charges on him!” Lorance’s mother, Anna Lorance, protested in an interview before the verdict in the court-martial was announced. “In war, people die. When you’re in a heated combat zone, you have seconds to think.” Lorance was sentenced to 20 years in prison, forfeiture of pay and dismissal from the military. In the annals of American war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, cases that have landed service members in court on serious charges have typically been preceded by outcries, allegations of egregious conduct and extensive coverage in the news media. The vast majority of defendants have been enlisted troops. There was the 2004 Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the 2005 Haditha massacre in Iraq — cases so shocking that they injected an indelible poison into the relationship between Baghdad and Washington. In Afghanistan, a squad of soldiers infamously described itself as a “kill team” for shooting Afghan men for sport in 2010; the group’s ringleader kept body parts as trophies. Just months before Lorance’s fateful patrol, an Army sergeant left his base at night and massacred 17 sleeping Afghans, including several children. Lorance’s case is remarkable because he is only the second Army officer charged with murder in a battlefield death during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His defense, outlined in a detailed account on a Web site registered to his name, sought to shift the burden, putting U.S. military rules of engagement on trial. “In modern warfare, there is no clearly defined enemy,” argues a statement on the site, which his family is using to raise money for the officer’s legal expenses. “Long gone are the days where American Soldiers could distinguish their enemy by the uniform they wore.” Lorance was born and raised in Hobart, a small town in Oklahoma, the son of a welder and a stay-at-home mom. As a toddler, his mother said, he played with toy guns and firetrucks. “We knew at a young age who he was going to be: someone who would defend and help,” she said. He signed up to become a military police officer on his 18th birthday, when the nation was barely a year into the Afghanistan war and had not yet invaded Iraq. As an enlisted man, Lorance was deployed to South Korea and later Iraq, where he spent 15 months. He loved the rigor and intensity of a military career, Anna Lorance, 54, said. “Every year, his pride just grew and grew, along with his rank,” his mother said. After his Iraq deployment, Lorance became the first college graduate in his family and was commissioned as an officer. He was deployed to southern Afghanistan in March 2012. After a first lieutenant in his unit, the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 8nd Airborne Division, was wounded in a bombing, Lorance unexpectedly became a platoon leader, a job that many infantry officers regard as among the most challenging and rewarding in a military career. Shortly after he and his men rolled out of their small outpost in Kandahar province early July 2, 2012, Army pilots warned Lorance over the radio about suspected insurgents loitering north, east and west of the platoon, according to the account posted on the Web site. As the troops, most of whom were on foot, approached a village, they spotted the men on motorcycles. Suspecting that they were insurgents, Lorance asked one of his soldiers to shoot them. “I was given a lawful order,” the shooter, Pvt. David Shilo, testified, according to the Fayetteville Observer. “My life wasn’t threatened at the time.” Lorance’s site contends that intelligence reports he had reviewed suggested that every man on a motorcycle in that vicinity was presumed to be a member of the Taliban because the insurgent group was in control of the area. The order to fire the two long-range shots was rightful, his account says, “eliminating the threat.” Prosecutors say Lorance knew that to be false — and they elicited testimony from service members that bolstered their case. U.S. troops in Afghanistan may open fire only if they detect hostile intent or actions in the battlefield. After some of his men reported the incident up the chain of command, Lorance was reassigned to a desk job and stripped of his weapon as an investigation was launched. In January, a few months after returning home with the rest of the brigade, he was charged with murder, attempted murder and misconduct. The charging document depicts Lorance as abusive. He warned an Afghan man whose property abutted the outpost that “if there is enemy activity on your land, we will shoot and kill you, your family and your kid,” the document says. It also accuses him of impeding the investigation by asking a soldier to falsely state in the incident report that the platoon could not examine the slain Afghans’ bodies because locals removed them shortly after the shooting. His parents raised money through the Web site and their neighbors to retain Guy Womack, a Houston lawyer and retired Marine lieutenant colonel who has represented high-profile military defendants. Womack said in a statement issued late Thursday night that he was “bitterly disappointed” by the verdict. He said his client’s actions were justified in light of the threat level in the area and the information conveyed to him during the patrol, which made Lorance feel the men in motorcycles posed an imminent threat. “I respect the Member’s decision,” Womack wrote, referring to the jury. “But I fear it bodes ill for other small unit leaders who face similar challenges, daily, in Afghanistan.” The sentence handed down against Lorance dashes his plans for the future. “Until this incident, Clint planned on serving his country for 10 more years, retiring from the Army and attending law school,” his Web site says. “Clint’s dream is to work in a district attorney’s office as an associate prosecutor.”	671	26	655	2023-04-18T13:20:58.427741Z	2023-04-19T12:57:19.604593Z	3.336	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 458, ""text"": ""Last summer, days into a new assignment leading a platoon in a volatile patch of southern Afghanistan, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army asked one of his soldiers to open fire on two Afghan men on motorcycles.

President Trump declared a national emergency last Thursday — but it wasn’t about the covid-19 pandemic or police brutality or nationwide protests. Rather, the subject of the emergency declaration was the International Criminal Court, the body investigating the United States for suspected war crimes in Afghanistan. Trump announced that the ICC represents an “unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.” The executive order pushes back by authorizing economic and diplomatic sanctions on ICC personnel working on the Afghanistan probe and anyone who helps them. The Trump administration has consistently and directly opposed the ICC, in contrast to the more passive opposition or even ad hoc support from previous administrations. The goal, as amplified by other U.S. officials, is to undermine the court, not only by interfering with the Afghanistan investigation but also investigations that don’t directly affect the United States. Yet the timing of this action seems odd, given the ongoing domestic health crisis, economic downturn and political crisis. Why now? And what will be the effect? In March, the ICC’s appeals chamber authorized Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate possible crimes committed in Afghanistan by U.S. and non-U.S. forces and intelligence, including the Afghan National Security Forces and the Taliban. The authorization came nearly a year after the pretrial chamber initially rejected Bensouda’s request to open an investigation. Now, she and her team will investigate alleged “torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape,” among other issues. The U.S. isn’t currently a member of the ICC. But Afghanistan, the country where the alleged abuses occurred, is a member. That puts the United States within the ICC’s jurisdiction. The sanctions order applies to any foreign person who materially supports or is directly involved in ICC efforts to “investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute any United States personnel.” It includes freezing these individuals’ U.S.-based financial assets and restricting their travel. The sanctions also apply to immediate family members. On first reading, the scope of the order is very wide, giving administration officials broad leeway in its application. The inclusion of family members is notable because a 2019 Trump executive order to sanction terrorists didn’t include their family members. Another unusual aspect of this executive order is the implication that U.S. officials could target human rights advocates and nongovernmental organizations, since they regularly work with the ICC and affected communities on investigations. Trump administration officials have threatened ICC-related sanctions before. For instance, in 2018, national security adviser John Bolton advocated for sanctions against any entity that assisted the court. But there was no follow-through. In March 2019, ahead of the court’s pretrial chamber decision to authorize or to not authorize the Afghanistan probe, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened visa restrictions and economic sanctions on any non-U.S. citizens who furthered the probe. The State Department revoked Bensouda’s visa to visit the United States less than a month later. But the timing of this latest round of sanctions differs from the previous one. In past skirmishes with the ICC, the Trump administration acted quickly, even preemptively. For instance, Bensouda’s visa was revoked before the decision of the pretrial chamber, which denied her permission to open the investigation. When the appeals chamber overturned the lower chamber’s decision on March 5, clearing the path for the probe, Pompeo quickly fired back. He promised to take “all necessary measures” to prevent the investigation from targeting U.S. personnel. But that was three months ago. Why order sanctions now? A notable component of the latest sanctions is that they go beyond ICC officials investigating the United States to include officials investigating U.S. allies. Pompeo’s statement last week explicitly mentions the most important of these allies — Israel. Chief Prosecutor Bensouda in December brought forward a request to open an investigation into possible crimes committed in Palestinian territories since 2014. The pretrial chamber is expected to rule on the request soon. Trump’s executive order may be an attempt to deter the pretrial chamber from authorizing the request, but also stymie the investigation if the request goes through. This isn’t without precedent. Pompeo’s threats last year apparently worked: The pretrial judges blocked the Afghanistan probe. Legal scholars and human rights advocates criticized the decision and speculated that the judges had capitulated to U.S. pressure. The ICC ultimately reversed the decision, but the delay roadblocked any investigation into Afghanistan for a time. Trump may be running the same play here — taking a bold move in the hopes that it pressures the pretrial chamber to deny authorization of the Palestine investigation. The ICC shows few signs of backing down. Within the day, the court’s public affairs unit responded, calling Trump’s actions an “attempt to interfere,” “an escalation,” “unacceptable” and contrary to the rule of law. The statement — which echoes criticisms from ICC member states — elaborates, “An attack on the ICC also represents an attack against the interests of victims of atrocity crimes, for many of whom the Court represents the last hope for justice.” In the U.S. court of public opinion, Trump’s strategy may not stoke antagonism toward the ICC. Our research indicates most Americans support the ICC and are concerned about U.S. world leadership and human rights. These concerns, combined with criticism of the sanctions from U.S. allies who are ICC members, may mean Americans will continue to support the court — despite Trump. Trump’s efforts may even backfire, triggering a type of “Streisand Effect,” where attempts to hamper investigations invite additional, negative public scrutiny. Trump is already polling poorly ahead of the November elections. ICC sanctions may not help. Trump probably considers the sanctions a move with some possible benefits — a distraction from troubles at home, or a way to hinder the Palestinian or Afghan investigations — and minimal costs. The administration team has grown accustomed to condemnation from abroad over “America First” policy. But ordinary citizens may disagree.

KABUL — An airstrike apparently carried out by U.S. forces heavily damaged a charitable hospital in northern Afghanistan on Saturday, killing at least 19 people — three of them reportedly children — in an incident that a senior U.N. official equated to a war crime. The airstrike occurred before dawn when a Doctors Without Borders trauma center in war-torn Kunduz was struck while doctors were treating dozens of patients. Hospital officials said they were assaulted from the air for 30 to 45 minutes, resulting in a large fire that burned some patients to death in their beds. Among those killed were 12 of the charity group’s staff members, the group said. “This attack is abhorrent and a grave violation of international humanitarian law,” said Meinie Nicolai, the group’s president. While the charity’s workers reported waves of bombs hitting their facility, the U.S.-led military coalition in Kabul issued a statement confirming one American airstrike that may have caused “collateral damage” to a “medical facility.” Authorities said it was launched against “insurgents who were directly firing upon U.S. servicemembers” who had traveled to Kunduz to advise Afghan security forces. The hospital disaster came at the end of a week in which U.S. forces had to step up their involvement in Afghanistan’s chaotic 14-year war, despite President Obama’s pledge to reduce the U.S. role and remove most American troops from the country by the end of 2016. U.S. fighter jets and Special Operations troops were dispatched to the area after Taliban militants on Monday overran Kunduz, Afghanistan’s sixth-largest city. It was unclear how close Taliban fighters may have been to the hospital Saturday or whether the U.S. military didn’t realize the building was a hospital. Afghan security officials said Taliban fighters had been pouring into the facility in recent days seeking treatment for gunshot wounds and other injuries. The charity and other international organizations reacted with outrage, and the hospital’s management said it had repeatedly informed the U.S.-led coalition of the facility’s precise GPS coordinates over the past few months. The location of the hospital was last conveyed to the international coalition three days before the airstrike, officials added. Independent probe sought In a statement, the United Nations’ top human rights official called for an independent, public investigation. “This event is utterly tragic, inexcusable and, possibly, even criminal,” said Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, adding that “if established as deliberate in a court of law, an airstrike on a hospital may amount to a war crime.” Jason Cone, executive director of Doctors Without Borders in the United States, said hospital officials in Kunduz immediately reached out to U.S. military officials when the airstrike occurred. “The bombing continued for more than 30 minutes after American and Afghan military officials in Kabul and Washington were first informed,” the organization said in a statement. A U.S. military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the strike appears to have been carried out by an AC-130 gunship, a heavily armed warplane. Late Saturday, Obama extended his condolences to those killed and injured and said in a statement that “the Department of Defense has launched a full investigation, and we will await the results of that inquiry before making a definitive judgment as to the circumstances of this tragedy.” ‘The only advanced hospital’ Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Army Gen. John F. Campbell, commander of the U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, called him Saturday to offer condolences. But U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was cautious in a statement issued Saturday, saying that “a full investigation” was underway and that he was extending prayers to those affected. “We are still trying to determine exactly what happened,” his statement said. In all, at least 12 Doctors Without Borders staff members were killed along with seven patients, three of them children, the group said. At least 37 other people were seriously injured, including 19 staff members. The hospital was “partially destroyed” in the attack, which began shortly after 2 a.m., the group said. “The bombs hit, and then we heard the plane circle round,” said Heman Nagarathnam, who is the charity’s head of programs in northern Afghanistan. “There was a pause, and then more bombs hit. This happened again and again. When I made it out from the office, the main hospital building was engulfed in flames.” Those who could, Nagarathnam said, hid in the hospital’s bunker. Medical staff and critically ill patients, however, were left exposed to the ensuing fire. A nurse working at the hospital, Lajos Zoltan Jecs, said that when she and other staff members emerged from a safe room after the attack, they looked into the intensive care unit, which was on fire. “Six patients were burning in their beds,” she said in a statement issued by Doctors Without Borders. “There are no words for how terrible it was,” she said. Mirza Laghmani, a local resident, said Afghan soldiers were battling militants near the hospital when Saturday’s airstrike took place. “The Taliban are taking and evacuating their wounded fighters to the hospital for treatment,” said Laghmani, who said the militant group still controls most of the city. “It was the only advanced hospital” in the area. Abdul Qahar Aram, spokesman for the Afghan army’s 209th Corps in northern Afghanistan, on Saturday said Taliban fighters are now hiding in “people’s houses, mosques and hospitals using civilians as human shields.” Sultan Arab, a local police commander in Kunduz, said the hospital came under an airstrike “because the Taliban had shifted their command center inside the hospital.” Doctors Without Borders, which operates in 20 countries and was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999, prides itself on treating any patient in need of assistance. Throughout the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military has faced criticism over civilian casualties and “friendly fire” incidents. Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai repeatedly accused the U.S. military of being reckless in how it carried out airstrikes. But after Ghani replaced Karzai last year, relations between the Afghan government and coalition officials improved dramatically. Ghani, who is hoping that Obama rethinks his timetable for removing troops from Afghanistan, did not directly criticize the United States for the tragedy. The U.S. military official said Special Forces soldiers were on the ground advising Afghan forces when they detected incoming fire from Taliban fighters. They received authorization to return fire at an area that was apparently close to the hospital, the official said. The AC-130 gunship, commonly known as the Spectre, can stay above a target for long amounts of time and carries a number of weapons, including a 105mm cannon. On Saturday, as the main hospital building was still smoldering, Doctors Without Borders circulated photographs showing the aftermath of the bombing. In one photo, a health-care worker in blood-stained scrubs huddled in a corner with another man. Later in the day, hospital officials began evacuating patients to another facility about two hours’ drive away, a risky undertaking because fierce fighting continues across swaths of northeastern Afghanistan. There are mounting concerns that an already grim humanitarian situation in Kunduz will worsen in the coming days. “The dead bodies are lying on the streets, both the Taliban and also civilians, and no one is allowed to pick up the bodies,” said Laghmani, the local resident. “There is also an electricity shortage, a water shortage plus a bread shortage.” There have been several incidents in the past in which U.S. airstrikes inadvertently caused large numbers of civilian casualties. In 2002, the U.S. military mistakenly bombed a wedding in Afghanistan’s central province of Uruzgan, killing more than 35 people. In 2009, the U.S.-led coalition bombed two tanker trucks in Kunduz, igniting a fireball that killed 74 civilians, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission.

KABUL — The day after Taliban fighters swept through Afghanistan’s northern city of Kunduz, capturing a major urban area for the first time since 2001, six stray bullets crashed through the windows at the Doctors Without Borders hospital there. The spillover from the militant assault, which had overwhelmed local security forces, was an unsettling sign at the lightly guarded civilian facility, where doctors and nurses were tending to a crush of patients. It was also a foreshadowing of a far greater calamity that would descend on the hospital four days later when, in the early hours of Oct. 3, nearby U.S. combat advisers authorized a gunship to unleash a powerful attack. The AC-130U plane, circling above in the dark, raked the medical compound with bursts of cannon fire, potentially even using high explosive incendiary munitions, for more than an hour. The assault left at least 22 people dead, some of them burned to death. The aid group, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, has demanded an international investigation of what it deems a possible war crime. The U.S. military, whose own account of what took place changed in the initial days after the attack, has said that the hospital was “mistakenly struck” in an attempt to support Afghan security forces. But the military has declined to provide full details of the incident while its investigators examine what occurred in the worst example of errant U.S. air power in recent years. This account of what took place is based on multiple interviews in Afghanistan and the United States with U.S. and Afghan military officials, Doctors Without Borders personnel and local Kunduz residents; some of those interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. Although government forces have recaptured much of Kunduz, the city’s collapse to a relatively small militant force was a blow to the Afghan government and its Western allies, illustrating the Taliban’s potency at a time when foreign forces are winding down their long mission in the country. In the days after the city’sSept. 28 collapse, Taliban fighters consolidated their control of the neighborhood around the hospital’s tree-lined compound, clamping down on residents’ movement and imposing their harsh interpretation of Islam. For much of that week, the central Kunduz neighborhood of Spinzar, which was under the militants’ control, was relatively quiet, according to residents and hospital officials. Inside the hospital, which the international relief agency in recent years had turned into the province’s most advanced medical facility, doctors and nurses were busier than ever. Between Sept. 28 and Oct. 3, exhausted hospital staffers treated 394 people, many of whom had received gunshot wounds during the battle for the city. All that week, a steady stream of Taliban fighters appeared at the hospital seeking treatment, adding to the patient load, according to a hospital security guard. Before fighters were admitted onto hospital grounds, the guard said, they were required to hand over their assault weapons to facility guards. Once inside, the Taliban fighters — many of whom had been shot — were treated like any other patient. The Taliban appeared to respect the neutrality of the charity operation, the only hospital functioning in Kunduz that week. “Even the Taliban didn’t harm wounded Afghan security forces taken to the hospital,” the guard said. Doctors Without Borders has declined to discuss patient identities, pointing to rules under the Geneva Conventions that state wounded soldiers or militants must be treated like other noncombatants. “We don’t even want to know who is inside because that is a basic protection, as a patient,” said Guilhem Molinie, director of the organization’s operations in Afghanistan. But organization officials said that some Taliban fighters were treated. According to the guard’s account, not just wounded Taliban fighters were present at the hospital that week. On Monday, Sept. 28, as the battle for Kunduz kicked off, Mullah Abdul Salam, the most senior Taliban commander in Kunduz province, visited wounded fighters receiving treatment there, the guard said. Some Afghan leaders have suggested that the Taliban had been using the hospital as a base. MSF officials have strongly denied those claims, saying no Taliban commanders and fighters had used hospital grounds to plan or carry out attacks. Shattered calm Early on Saturday, Oct. 3, a team of U.S. Special Operations forces was tracking the fighting across Kunduz from a small U.S.-Afghan joint operations center at the airport, about five miles south of the city. The JOC, as it is called, has become a hallmark of the long insurgent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. forces liaise closely with their local counterparts. As part of the limited U.S. military mission in Afghanistan, that night the U.S. forces were supporting elite Afghan troops as they fought their way through the city, and helped coordinate U.S. air power to back their assault against the Taliban. Gen. John F. Campbell, commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, told lawmakers in Washington on Thursday that his forces were providing planning and “training advice” for local forces around Kunduz, with a headquarters support group at the airfield. In the days after the city’s fall, Afghan security forces had advanced into Kunduz’s commercial district but were still locked in intense clashes with Taliban militants holed up in government buildings, private homes and the abandoned offices of international aid groups. That Afghan security forces had made it into the city at all was a result of the airstrikes that the U.S. military began to conduct to support their advance. The strikes earlier in the week were reported to have killed nearly 50 Taliban fighters who were attempting to advance on Afghan and coalition troops at the Kunduz airport. In central Kunduz on the night of Oct. 2, hospital staffers were settling in. Five patients — members of a family shot while trying to flee Kunduz — had been brought in earlier that evening, around 6 p.m. The wards were mostly quiet after that, and no major fighting had been reported. “It was the first time the team could rest and [the] first time we could plan some operations that had been delayed before,” Molinie said. Shortly before midnight, clashes erupted nearby between Taliban and government forces and quickly intensified, said Islamuddin, a Kunduz resident who lives about 50 yards from the hospital gates and, like many Afghans, goes by one name. At the airport, U.S. advisers received a request from Afghan special forces for urgent help in the vicinity of the hospital, where they reported receiving Taliban fire. Scrambling to assist, American Special Operations forces advisers requested immediate close air support for the Afghan commandos. Soon after, an AC-130U from the 4th Special Operations Squadron — call sign “Hammer” — was lumbering through a mostly clear night sky toward the target position. The AC-130U is one variant of the AC-130 gunship. A holdover from the Vietnam War, the plane is a converted transport aircraft loaded with 25mm and 40mm cannons as well as a 105mm howitzer. As its weapons jut from the left side the aircraft, the AC-130 engages targets in a wide left turn. Crewed by a dozen airmen, including a Special Operations Ground liaison officer responsible for coordinating with ground forces, the AC-130 has low-light and thermal sensors that give it a “God’s eye” of the battlefield in almost all weather conditions. According to individuals familiar with the incident, American forces from the JOC directed the aircraft over the Afghan special forces and sent up the initial “call for fire” to the aircraft. The request gave the aircraft the necessary targeting information as well as the location of friendly forces. According to an individual familiar with the aircraft’s operations that night, the sensor operators identified fighters moving into and firing from one of the hospital’s front porticos. The crew, piloting an aircraft that rarely targets buildings, asked the JOC twice if they wanted the aircraft to engage, the individual said. How close active Taliban forces may have been to the hospital — a point where the accounts of the charity’s personnel and Afghan security officials diverge — is now a central question for investigators. Even if Taliban militants were firing from the compound, U.S. rules of engagement would not have allowed an airstrike if the crew knew it was a protected civilian facility. On Saturday, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that the U.S. military was authorized to make “appropriate” condolence payments to the families of civilians killed in the hospital attack, and to provide funding for repairing the hospital. U.S. investigators are now trying to determine whether the air crew knew that the target was a hospital. While the Afghan government has not said definitively whether it thinks that the Taliban forces were firing from near or within the compound, local officials have said that the group had set up a “command center” at the facility — an assertion Doctors Without Borders has strongly rejected. Who placed the call? Another unresolved question is who placed the request for the air support. According to Brig. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, troops from the Afghan army’s 209th Corps were fighting on the ground in that area, but officials in Kabul were unsure whether they made the request processed by U.S. advisers at the Kunduz airport. Waziri suspects that Afghan soldiers were aware of the hospital’s location. Before soldiers begin combat, they receive detailed maps from local police outlining the locations of mosques, schools and hospitals, he said. A few minutes after 2 a.m., following approval from U.S. forces, the plane fired a massive initial burst at the main hospital building, which houses the facility’s emergency rooms and intensive care unit. While it is unclear what weapons were employed, the AC-130U’s 40mm round has a high explosive incendiary munition that is lined with zirconium. The rounds are known for causing fires. One MSF physician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons, had finished his shift and was drifting off to sleep in the hospital’s break room when a giant blast shook the building. Light fixtures and parts of the ceiling crashed down on him. The explosion, possibly from the plane’s 105mm gun, was so powerful that it shattered windows of nearby homes. “I saw the flame of fire rise from the hospital,” Islamuddin said. The physician and other staff members rushed to the hospital’s basement, which was used as a makeshift bomb shelter. Far above, the U.S. pilots banked the aircraft into a wide orbit circling the hospital. Over the next 65 minutes, the plane unleashed additional fire on each pass around the facility below, every 15 minutes or so. Some staff members and patients may have died instantly; others died amid the rubble or as colleagues tried fruitlessly to administer care. A pharmacist died in the hospital office. As a fire engulfed the hospital building, at least six patients burned to death in the intensive care unit. During the attack, staff members placed desperate calls to colleagues, who relayed messages to U.S. officials in Kabul and Washington, including to the Pentagon’s Joint Staff in Washington, the organization said. In the days before the assault, Doctors Without Borders said, it provided the hospital’s location repeatedly to the same officials. But the relief group has declined to provide details of exactly who it alerted. The office of the Joint Staff says it has not yet located an individual who received that information. At about 3:30 a.m., staffers huddled in the basement bomb shelter heard the guns fall silent. It is not known why the air crew chose to halt the attack. Many of those who had taken shelter below ground were too frightened to emerge and stayed there until dawn. “Then we heard this calling, ‘Anyone alive? You can come out,’ ” the physician recalled. When he emerged into the rubble of the smoldering hospital, the doctor immediately saw the bodies of patients and colleagues. Other staffers began to make their way out into the open and rushed to treat those wounded in the attacks. Some could not be saved. One doctor died on a desk while another staff member tried to perform emergency surgery to save him. Mohammad Sharif in Kabul and Julie Tate and Andrew Katz in Washington contributed to this report.
