"News that sugar tycoon and longtime anti-Castro exile leader Alfonso Fanjul has quietly traveled to Cuba and is open to doing business there prompted an angry response Monday from a Cuban American member of Congress, who called Fanjul’s actions “pathetic” and “shameful.” Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) released her statement in the wake of a Washington Post report quoting Fanjul as expressing an “open mind"" to investing in Cuba “under the right circumstances.” Her reaction shows how emotional and polarized the politics of U.S.-Cuba relations remain -- so much so that a lawmaker feels the need to lash out at one of the giants of American industry (and one whose family gives millions in donations to both parties). The Fanjuls own one of the world’s largest sugar empires -- growing, processing and refining cane sugar across the United States, Latin America and Europe. It is impossible to overstate the importance of Fanjul and his brother Jose “Pepe” Fanjul to both parties. Alfonso, known as “Alfy,” is a major Democratic donor and fundraiser and is close with both Clintons. Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), look to the family for support, as well. Gov. Chris Christie headlined a reception in the midst of his scandal last month at the home of Alfy’s nephew, Pepe Jr. Now, the family patriarch is taking a risky stand in his community. And all the 2016 White House hopefuls from both parties will have to decide whether they are ready to evolve with him on an issue that, as Ros-Lehtinen’s statement suggests, still drives votes and conversation in one of Florida’s most important electorates. Rubio, for instance, the son of Cuban immigrants, has attacked those who want to engage more with Castro for “enabling” a corrupt regime to get richer. But now the very policies he espouses are being rejected by at least one prominent member of a family that Rubio credits with raising crucial resources for his 2010 Senate bid. The attack from Ros-Lehtinen was surprisingly personal. The chairwoman of the subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa called Fanjul’s actions “shameful for a Cuban-American who fled the Castro regime.” “At a time when the democracy activists on the island are facing even harsher reprisals from the brutal Cuban regime, it's pathetic that a Cuban-American tycoon feels inspired to trample on the backs of those activists in order to give the communist thugs more money with which to repress,” she said. Fanjul traveled to the island with two groups organized by the Brookings Institution. In a rare interview, he told The Post that his primary goal was to find ways to unite the “Cuban family,” referring broadly to those who live on the island and people of Cuban heritage who live now in Florida and elsewhere. He said he has not spoken with Cuban officials directly about investing in their country but discussed the conditions under which he might consider it at some point. “Right now there’s no way for us to consider investing in Cuba. How can you work a deal if you’re not legally allowed to do it?” he said. “Now, would we consider an investment at some later date?” continued Fanjul, a permanent U.S. resident who maintains Spanish citizenship. “If there’s an arrangement within Cuba and the United States, and legally it can be done and there’s a proper framework set up and in place, then we will look at that possibility. We have an open mind.” He said the Cuban government — which has business deals with companies from countries such as Canada and Spain — would have to change its economic structure to make it easier and safer for outside companies to make money. “Cuba has to presumably satisfy the requirements that investors need, which are primarily a return on investment and security of the investment, so they feel comfortable with what they’re doing,” he said. “I personally would look at that in the same framework as any investor would.” Many observers said Fanjul’s willingness to engage with Cuba reflected a changing landscape in the Cuban American community, where many are taking a more pragmatic view that the only way to democratize the island is to foster more contact with the people who live there. The president of the formerly hard-line Cuban American National Foundation, Pepe Hernandez, told The Post that he trusted Fanjul to do the right thing and supported his efforts. The question is whether Fanjul’s willingness to speak out -- along with similar moves by other Cuban exile investors -- will push  the conversation to a new place. If even the Fanjul family, which directly suffered losses to the Castro regime, is willing to look anew at Cuba, then lawmakers and candidates might feel more comfortable -- or even compelled -- to evolve, as well. Here is Ros-Lehtinen’s full statement: ""At a time when the democracy activists on the island are facing even harsher reprisals from the brutal Cuban regime, it's pathetic that a Cuban-American tycoon feels inspired to trample on the backs of those activists in order to give the communist thugs more money with which to repress. The only little old thing that is standing in Alfy's way of realizing these sleazy business deals with the devil is U.S. law. He doesn't talk about the arbitrary arrests of pro-freedom leaders in Cuba or the continual beatings endured by the peaceful Damas de Blanco. Oh no, for Alfy, the only hindrance to turning a profit off the suffering of the Cuban people is pesky U.S. laws and he is working with groups to undo those laws. It is sickening to read that he brings up the separation of the Cuban family when he is doing all he can to exacerbate that problem. Shame on him. And while Alfy was massaging his future profit deals with Castro's Foreign Minister, there were over one thousand political arrests last month."	79	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 269, ""text"": ""that sugar tycoon and longtime anti-Castro exile leader Alfonso Fanjul has quietly traveled to Cuba and is open to doing business there prompted an angry response Monday from a Cuban American member of Congress, who called Fanjul’s actions “pathetic” and “shamefu"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 150, ""end"": 269, ""text"": ""an angry response Monday from a Cuban American member of Congress, who called Fanjul’s actions “pathetic” and “shamefu"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 272, ""end"": 466, ""text"": ""Rep.

President Obama’s surprising move toward normalizing relations with Cuba amounts to a big bet that the nation — and, particularly, the crucial swing state of Florida — has turned a political corner from the Cold War era. Obama’s decision aligns with a growing sentiment that current Cuba policy has become counterproductive. Among those making that argument has been former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumed front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, who said the new stance has the potential to “encourage real and lasting reforms for the Cuban people.” But the new stance immediately came under challenge. Many leading Republicans — and one Democratic senator — denounced the president as feckless, overreaching and naive in his negotiations with the government of Presi­dent Raúl Castro, the brother of longtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro. “This entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion, on a lie, the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people,” said Sen. ­Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is considering a presidential bid and whose parents emigrated from Cuba in the 1950s. “All this is going to do is give the Castro regime, which controls every aspect of Cuban life, the opportunity to manipulate these changes to perpetuate itself in power.” Former Florida governor Jeb Bush — considered the GOP’s 2016 front-runner after announcing an exploratory bid Tuesday — had called for strengthening the embargo against Cuba as recently as two weeks ago. On his Facebook page Wednesday, Bush wrote that the administration’s decision to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba is “the latest foreign policy misstep by this President, and another dramatic overreach of his executive authority. It undermines America’s credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.” Among other possible Republican 2016 presidential candidates, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin criticized Obama on Cuba, while Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and several others were ­quiet. The bulk of the GOP comments suggested that, for now at least, the conservative base remains firmly committed to keeping relations with Cuba in the deep-freeze where they have been for half a century. That position, however, is increasingly at odds with the view of the electorate at large. More than a decade ago, polls began showing a tilt in public sentiment toward normalizing ties with the island 90 miles from the tip of Key West, Fla. In 2009, a Washington Post-ABC News survey found that two-thirds of Americans supported restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, while only 27 percent opposed doing so. The old ideological and economic battle lines have also been fading on the ground. Even as a trade embargo has remained in place, nearly 600,000 U.S. travelers went to Cuba last year — the majority of them Cuban Americans. Business interests have pushed for more openness, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce pledged its support for Obama’s decision. “Public opinion in Florida and in the country is moving to moderation on Cuba, and Obama is effectively using his political capital to make a long-anticipated shift that history and the U.S. public will support,” Ted Piccone, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution’s Latin America Initiative, wrote in an e-mail from Havana. Although the Cuban American population has long been identified with the Republican Party, that allegiance also has shifted. The change is largely generational, with those two or three generations removed from the ones who fled Castro’s regime in the 1950s and 1960s more open to voting Democratic. In 2012, Obama won the vote of Cuban Americans nationally by two percentage points and took a majority of their votes in Miami. He also won Florida twice — the second time after loosening some travel and other restrictions involving Cuba in his first term. But Republican political consultant Alex Castellanos said Obama’s latest initiative will add fuel to arguments that he has lacked steadiness and strength in international relations, potentially elevating foreign policy as an issue in 2016. “Weakness invites the wolves,” Castellanos said. “This is a president whose naivete is dangerous, who sees the world as he wishes it were and not as it is.” As recently as the mid-1990s, the conventional wisdom was that no presidential candidate could hope to carry Florida unless he took a hard line on Cuba. Former president Bill Clinton recalled in his memoir, “My Life,” that after Cuba shot down two civilian planes flown by an anti-Castro group, he signed the 1996 Helms-Burton Act stiffening the embargo, even though he had misgivings about the effect it would have on his ability to press the Cuban government for reform. Now his wife, Hillary, is considered the leading contender for the 2016 Democratic nomination if she decides to run. Cuba’s release of Alan Gross, a U.S. Agency for International Development contractor who was imprisoned for five years, was the achievement of a goal that Clinton had sought in public and in private during her tenure at the State Department. In a statement Wednesday, Clinton said, “I am deeply relieved by Alan Gross’s safe return to the United States. . . . It is great news that Alan is finally home with his family, where he belongs.” In her memoir, “Hard Choices,” released in June, Clinton blamed the Cuban government for making the case so difficult to resolve. “It is possible that hard liners within the regime exploited the Gross case as an opportunity to put the brakes on any possible rapprochement with the United States and the domestic reforms that would require,” she wrote. Clinton’s statement Wednesday also said, “I support President Obama’s decision to change course on Cuba policy, while keeping the focus on our principal objective — supporting the aspirations of the Cuban people for freedom.” She said: “Despite good intentions, our decades-long policy of isolation has only strengthened the Castro regime’s grip on power. As I have said, the best way to bring change to Cuba is to expose its people to the values, information, and material comforts of the outside world.” In “Hard Choices,” Clinton wrote that she had recommended to Obama that he review the embargo. “It wasn’t achieving its goals and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America,” Clinton wrote. “After twenty years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive.” The work of opening diplomatic and economic ties severed for more than 53 years will probably carry into the next presidency, particularly if the Republican-led Congress ties up the most meaningful ele­ments of an embargo repeal. Only a few Democrats signaled disagreement with Obama’s decision. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a longtime hawk on Cuba policy, said the president’s move was “misguided and fails to understand the nature of the ­regime in Cuba that has exerted its authoritarian control over the Cuban people for 55 years.” Former Florida governor and senator Bob Graham, a revered elder in state Democratic politics, also expressed misgivings. He said in an interview that he would have preferred moving toward normalizing relations “on a more incremental basis.” The administration “went for the long play” instead, he said. “We’re in a situation now where we have made a very generous offer to the Cuban government and don’t have leverage to make sure that those commitments filter down to the Cuban people,” Graham said.	80	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 219, ""text"": ""President Obama’s surprising move toward normalizing relations with Cuba amounts to a big bet that the nation — and, particularly, the crucial swing state of Florida — has turned a political corner from the Cold War era"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 221, ""end"": 324, ""text"": ""Obama’s decision aligns with a growing sentiment that current Cuba policy has become counterproductive."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2452, ""end"": 2597, ""text"": ""than a decade ago, polls began showing a tilt in public sentiment toward normalizing ties with the island 90 miles from the tip of Key West, Fla."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3748, ""end"": 4004, ""text"": ""In 2012, Obama won the vote of Cuban Americans nationally by two percentage points and took a majority of their votes in Miami.

"President Obama  hailed “a historic step forward” in the relationship between the United States and Cuba on Wednesday as he formally announced the reopening of embassies in their respective capitals later this month after 54 years. “This is another demonstration that we do not have to be imprisoned by the past,” Obama said during remarks in the Rose Garden, where he was joined by Vice President Biden. “A year ago,” Obama added, “it might have seemed impossible that the United States would once again be raising our flag over the embassy in Havana. This is what change looks like.” The step is the latest in Obama's bid to move U.S.-Cuba relations past the Cold War division that has kept the two countries isolated diplomatically from one another for more than half a century. The president has said the period of isolation has not succeeded in pushing Cuba to significant political reforms, and he has suggested that a thawing of relations would prod the regime of President Raúl Castro to loosen restrictions on free speech and political dissent in exchange for a softening of U.S. economic sanctions. Obama and Castro exchanged letters formally authorizing the respective embassies to open July 20 in each capital. In his remarks, Obama said Secretary of State John F. Kerry will travel to Havana to raise the American flag at the U.S. Embassy compound. Cuban officials said Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez will lead a delegation of ""distinguished representatives of Cuban society"" for the official ceremony to reopen the embassy in Washington. ""In making this decision, Cuba is encouraged by the reciprocal intention to develop respectful and cooperative relations between our two peoples and governments,"" Castro wrote, according to an English translation provided by the White House. [Read Obama's letter here.] [Read the English translation of Castro's letter here.] The decision to restore relations and re-open embassies is only the first phase, the Castro government said in a statement, ""in what will be a long and complicated path toward normalizing bilateral ties,"" a process that will depend on ""addressing a series of issues derived from the policies of the past, which are still in force, and affect the Cuban people and their nation."" Reaction from White House allies was enthusiastic.  In a message on Twitter, former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote: “New US Embassy in Havana helps us engage Cuban people & build on efforts to support positive change. Good step for US & Cuban people.” But critics of Obama's strategy chided him for rewarding a Castro regime that has employed harsh tactics to repress human rights and political dissent. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination next year, called it a policy of ""unconditional surrender"" to Castro and threatened to hold up anyone Obama nominates as U.S. ambassador to Cuba until Obama can ""demonstrate that he has made some progress in alleviating the misery of our friends, the people of Cuba."" Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, also a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, accused the president of attempting to burnish his legacy ""with dubious diplomatic achievements and photo-ops."" The more important question, Bush said, is ""whether improved relations between Havana and Washington advance the cause of human rights and freedom for the Cuban people.  The ongoing detention of dissidents and continued human rights abuses suggest the administration’s policy is failing this test."" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a Cuban-American, also criticized the president, saying that ""the message is democracy and human rights take a back seat to a legacy initiative.” But former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, who like Clinton is pursuing the Democratic nomination for the White House, praised the move, writing on Twitter: ""Democracy creates opportunity."" Kerry, who is in Switzerland for the final round of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, would become the first U.S. Secretary of State to visit Cuba since 1945, officials said. Cuba and the United States, Kerry said during remarks shortly after Obama spoke, will ""continue to have sharp differences"" over areas such as democracy and human rights. But they have common interests in issues such as counterterrorism, counternarcotics and migration, he added. In his remarks, Obama alluded to his critics who have denounced the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Obama administration and the Castro regime. “Yes, there are those who want to turn back the clock and double down on a policy of isolation ... but that has not worked for the past 50 years,” Obama said. “Nobody expects Cuba to transform overnight. But American engagement ... is the best way to advance our interests and support democracy and human rights.” The president renewed his call on Congress to lift travel and business restrictions in Cuba for American citizens. U.S. officials said having a full-fledged embassy will also allow expanded services for the growing number of Americans visiting Cuba, as well as issuing visas for Cubans to come to the United States. Jeffrey DeLaurentis, a foreign service officer currently on his third tour in Cuba, will become charge d’affaires at the new embassy. In its statement, the Castro government said that relations between the two countries cannot be considered ""normal"" until the United States lifts its trade sanctions, gives back the Guantanamo naval base, ceases U.S.-government sponsored radio and television broadcasts directed at the island, ends U.S. government programs aimed at ""subversion and internal destabilization,"" and compensates the Cuban people for ""economic and human damages,"" that have resulted from its policies. Rather than a return to the relationship the two countries had prior to Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Havana said the United States and Cuba would need to start from scratch, building a relationship that has ""never existed between our countries, and in particular, after the U.S. military intervention, 117 years ago, in the independence war that Cuba had waged for three decades against Spanish colonialism,"" a reference to the 1898 Spanish-American War. The statement reiterated Castro's offer to engage in ""respectful dialogue"" with the United States on issues of disagreement and areas of potential cooperation. The United States and Cuba initially announced the plan to reestablish diplomatic relations late last year. The move, which followed more than 18 months of secret negotiations, was made possible by Cuba’s concession to release a detained U.S. aid contractor. Since then, progress toward a formal reopening of embassies has progressed slowly. In April, Obama met briefly with Castro on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas in Panama, symbolically ending more than a half century of official estrangement. “Over time, it is possible for us to turn the page and develop a new relationship between our two countries,” Obama said at the April summit. After the two shook hands, Castro said he agreed with Obama. “We are willing to discuss everything, but we need to be patient, very patient,” the Cuban leader said. Cuban officials visited Washington in May for a fourth round of talks on reestablishing diplomatic relations and opening embassies in their respective capitals. A big point of contention in the talks had been whether U.S. diplomats would be able to move about Cuba without seeking government permission. Both U.S. and Cuban officials expressed hope after the May meetings that a deal was imminent. White House press secretary Josh Earnest even raised the possibility that Obama would visit Cuba during his remaining time in the White House. The reopening of the embassy would probably clear one of the final barriers to the president realizing that goal. The White House must notify Congress 15 days before opening the embassy. After relations were severed in 1961, U.S. officials mothballed the six-story modernist embassy. U.S. officials returned to Havana in 1977 when the two countries opened “Interests Sections” under the auspices of the Swiss government. The American compound currently has about 50 U.S. staffers. A big break in the initial negotiations with Havana came when Obama shook Castro’s hand at the 2013 memorial service for former South African leader Nelson Mandela. “That caught the Cubans off guard,” Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said in an interview Monday at the Aspen Ideas Festival. “When we saw them next they said, ‘Your president treated us with respect.’ ” Even after the embassy is reopened, it would take congressional action to end the decades-long economic embargo of the island nation. Republicans controlling Congress have vowed to keep the embargo in place.  "	82	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 230, ""text"": ""nt Obama  hailed “a historic step forward” in the relationship between the United States and Cuba on Wednesday as he formally announced the reopening of embassies in their respective capitals later this month after 54 years"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 586, ""end"": 1088, ""text"": ""he step is the latest in Obama's bid to move U.S.-Cuba relations past the Cold War division that has kept the two countries isolated diplomatically from one another for more than half a century.

The Cold War died Wednesday. Its death was foretold, yet somehow it still came as a shock. It didn’t expire on a bayside battlefield in the Caribbean or with a mushroom cloud or even with an exploding cigar. It perished at a White House podium. The prisoner swap that set Alan Gross free — and the sweeping changes to U.S. policy on Cuba that went with it — won’t heal all wounds, nor will it vanquish the powerful cold warriors in the U.S. Congress. But it did fundamentally alter a curio of American foreign policy that deeply influenced popular culture and played an outsize role in U.S. presidential politics for more than half a century. In April 1959, Richard Nixon was unimpressed with the bearded revolutionary in green fatigues who arrived at his office. Fidel Castro’s “ideas as to how to run a government or an economy are less developed than those of almost any world figure I have met in fifty countries,” Nixon, then the U.S. vice president, wrote in a memo declassified in 2001. Nixon distrusted the newly victorious Castro, whom he had correctly pegged as a communist, as did his boss, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In the years to come, the Berlin Wall rose and fell. The Soviet Union collapsed. Nixon went to China. Yet the grudge match with Castro persisted, spanning 11 U.S. presidencies. It survived intact as a relic of the Cold War, which may have essentially ended in the 1990s but lived on in the dysfunctional relationship between the United States and Cuba. Dating back to the early days of his regime, killing Castro became the tragicomic obsession of a generation of American spies. If they couldn’t get him with a combustible cigar, then they might consider offing him with a gift of a wet suit laced with tuberculosis or, perhaps, enlist the help of a mob hit man. Sometimes, however, the efforts to rid the island of Castro were just plain tragic. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration approved a poorly planned and poorly supported invasion at the Bay of Pigs. Castro demonstrated his brutality by executing nine of those who’d plotted against him. It was a crushing blow to Cuban exiles in Florida who welcomed the coming of each new year with the toast “Next year in Havana.” The next year, instead of reunions on the island, they got the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Soviet missiles were spotted in Cuba, and it took extraordinary diplomatic gymnastics to avert an apocalyptic conflict between the superpowers. Castro’s seemingly eternal squabble with the United States evolved into the central animating force of Cuban political discourse during his years as president and remained there once he gave over titular control of the country to his brother Raúl after falling ill in 2006. Rather than accept blame for mismanaging the Cuban economy and for the startling decay of the nation’s infrastructure, the Castros were forever pointing at the U.S. trade embargo. (Even though the embargo remains in place, Obama’s policy shift is designed to increase commerce between the nations by expanding U.S. exports and banking links.) Fidel Castro’s repression of free speech, jailing of political prisoners, refusal to hold elections, travel restrictions and almost total ban on private enterprise have made thousands of Cubans desperate to leave. On the streets of Havana, people talk of escaping to “La Yuma,” Cuban slang for the United States that most likely derived from the 1950s Western “3:10 to Yuma.” The reference to a long-ago film only reinforces the impression of Havana as existing in a time warp, where classic U.S. cars share roads with clunky Soviet junkers, and where every Cuban driver has to be a mechanic. In the provinces, they don’t even have the luxury of broken-down cars; many people have to get around in horse-drawn carriages or walk. To get to La Yuma, Cubans have been willing to do almost anything, including risking death. They’ve pushed into the sea on rafts and inner tubes and surfboards, anything they could find. They’ve arrived on makeshift boats made from tractors and old tires. In one unforgettable escape attempt, a Cuban family tried to get to Florida in a fantastically conceived watercraft fashioned from a green 1951 Chevy truck. Tens of thousands came in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, crowding into temporary housing at the Orange Bowl in Miami while Castro boasted that by allowing them to leave, he had “flushed the toilets” of Cuba. A succession of U.S. governments tried to make it easier for Cubans to come to the United States. In the mid-1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration instituted the Cuban Adjustment Act, which aids Cuban migrants in becoming permanent residents after being admitted to the United States. Clinton would expand the opportunities for Cuban migrants by putting in place a “wet foot, dry foot” policy in which Cuban migrants who are caught at sea are usually sent back to the island, while those who make it to land are usually allowed to stay. Some of the most in­trac­table disputes between the United States and Cuba can be traced to the waters of the 90 miles of the Florida Straits. In 1996, two planes operated by Brothers to the Rescue, an exile group that assisted rafters, were shot down above the straits after what the Cuban government claimed was an intrusion in its airspace. Four men died, and with them went the hopes of would-be Cuba-policy reformers who were optimistic that then-President Bill Clinton would loosen sanctions on the island. Nearly four years later, the mother of Elián González drowned while fleeing Cuba, setting off an epic custody battle that ended with the 6-year-old being wrenched from the home of Miami relatives by gun-toting federal agents and sent back to his father and Cuba. Thousands of Cuban migrants are believed to have died trying to enter the United States by sea. Through the tragedies, a certain mystique about Cuba has been magnified by its inaccessibility. American tourists slipped onto the island, evading U.S. restrictions by flying to Havana via Mexico or Jamaica and then pleading with Cuban airport personnel not to stamp their passports. Making it out with a box or even a handful of Montecristo cigars or a bottle of Havana Club rum, for some, was a feat worth bragging about. But many exiles viewed such trips as unforgivable betrayals that helped an oppressive government by pumping hard currency into its beleaguered economy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has pressed to expand options for U.S. businesses in Cuba. And investors have looked longingly at the island, as Spanish and Canadian firms have established footholds in a place with vast tracts of undeveloped beachfront, scuba-diving Edens and outmoded, inefficient farms. The Cuban American sugar baron Alfonso “Alfy” Fanjul — a major backer of anti-Castro exile groups — recently said he would be interested in exploring business opportunities on the island. His remarks, published in January in The Washington Post, set Cuba watchers aflame with speculation that major changes in U.S. policy might be coming. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) accused Fanjul of trying to make a deal with “the devil.” “At a time when the democracy activists on the island are facing even harsher reprisals from the brutal Cuban regime, it’s pathetic that a Cuban American tycoon feels inspired to trample on the backs of those activists in order to give the communist thugs more money with which to repress,” Ros-Lehtinen said at the time. Popular culture has been impervious to the political disputes. It’s almost impossible to walk onto a college campus in the United States or Europe without seeing Alberto Korda’s famous photo of Che Guevara, titled “El Guerrillero Heroico,” or “The Heroic Guerrilla.” The New Year’s Eve scene in “Godfather II” probably educated more Americans about the victory of the Castro revolution than any schoolbook. And Woody Allen sent up the Cuban revolution in his spoof “Bananas.” But farce might be the hardest genre to pull off because the reality of U.S.-Cuba relations is often so quirky. This year, the Associated Press figured out that the U.S. Agency for International Development had sought to trigger a youth uprising, a sort of Cuban Spring, by setting up a phony, Twitter-like network in Cuba called “ZunZuneo,” a Cuban slang term for the sound of a hummingbird. More recently, AP revealed that USAID had hired a Serbian music promoter to infiltrate Cuba’s hip-hop scene in hopes of sparking youth protests against the Castro government. And the United States has spent tens of thousands of dollars a year to maintain a plane that is supposed to broadcast American television programming in Cuba but never flies because of a budget stalemate. In the meantime, Fidel Castro revealed a few years back that he has been collecting annual rent checks from the U.S. government for the use of Guantanamo, the U.S. base on the island, for half a century. But, in protest of U.S. policies, he says his cash-strapped government has only cashed one of the $4,000 checks in all those years — and that was by accident. For years, the two nations conducted an odd propaganda war, one-upping each other, in front of the building that houses the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, along the city’s scenic seawall, known as the Malecon. U.S. officials angered Castro by putting up a Christmas display that included a large “75” — a reference to the number of dissidents arrested in an early 2000s crackdown. Castro responded by erecting big signs showing images of U.S. abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Two years later, the United States infuriated Cuban officials by installing a digital sign that scrolled news reports and provocative quotes in five-foot-tall letters on the side of the building. On a typical day, there were would be news items containing information such as the stats of a Cuban defector playing in the major leagues or a U.S. magazine naming Fidel Castro one of the world’s wealthiest heads of state (the Cuban leader claims to have no personal wealth). And once there was a quip from the comedian George Burns: “How sad that all the people who would know how to run this country are driving taxis or cutting hair.” The Castro government responded by installing 148 giant flagpoles in the park outside the building, making it almost impossible to see the scrolling news display. In 2009, U.S. officials in Havana quietly had the sign removed as Obama was beginning to loosen restrictions on travel to Cuba. Now people look for another type of sign: the departure board at Miami International Airport. It’s filling with flights leaving for Havana.	81	"[{""start"": 2920, ""end"": 3081, ""text"": ""Even though the embargo remains in place, Obama’s policy shift is designed to increase commerce between the nations by expanding U.S. exports and banking links."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6416, ""end"": 6503, ""text"": ""The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has pressed to expand options for U.S. businesses in Cuba."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6719, ""end"": 6906, ""text"": ""The Cuban American sugar baron Alfonso “Alfy” Fanjul — a major backer of anti-Castro exile groups — recently said he would be interested in exploring business opportunities on the island."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 10369, ""end"": 10495, ""text"": ""n 2009, U.S. officials in Havana quietly had the sign removed as Obama was beginning to loosen restrictions on travel to Cuba"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	92	2023-03-18T11:48:04.813306Z	2023-03-18T11:48:04.813427Z	888.881
"""The Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore,"" Fidel Castro told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg in a rare 2010 interview. Goldberg had asked whether Castro still sought to export his communist system to a Latin America that -- though Goldberg had the tact not to point this out -- had largely rejected it. ""He wasn't rejecting the ideas of the Revolution,"" Julie Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations explained. ""I took it to be an acknowledgment that under 'the Cuban model' the state has much too big a role in the economic life of the country."" It was also an acknowledgement of something that American policymakers from former president Bill Clinton to Reagan-era secretary of state George Schultz have suggested as well: The U.S. embargo on Cuba, like the Cuban communist system, is in many ways a relic of a bygone era. But both seemed to come down a very small bit today, bringing this Cold War skirmish another step closer to the 21st century.  The Cuban government has announced it will lift the onerous, expensive and often prohibitive restrictions on foreign travel for its citizens. It's impossible to say for sure why Havana has taken down this piece of the political-economic wall separating Cuba from the rest of the world, but it seems like the reasons may be economic. There are more than 1 million ethnic Cubans living in the United States, and easing restrictions could boost remittances back home. Temporary economic migrants are also more likely to leave family members in Cuba, and thus to send money back. Another economic factor is brain drain: Easier visas mean Cubans are more likely to choose legal travel back-and-forth from the United States and less likely to flee permanently. The government announcement seemed to hint at this, in typical communist propaganda style: ""Measures will remain to preserve the human capital created by the Revolution in the face of the theft of talent applied by the powerful,"" it read. The economic case for normalization seems to be overcoming the political case for isolation. How much of a difference will the change actually make? It's tough to say. As the Atlantic Wire pointed out, President Obama eased restrictions on American visits to Cuba last year, but it seems to have had little actual effect. If nothing else, the symbolism of Cuba's policy change -- and on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis that almost led to a U.S. invasion of the island -- is tough to deny. The half-century hard-line positions that have dominated Washington and Havana are eroding. As more Cuban economic immigrants come into the United States, and start to outnumber the Cuban political refugees that have long dominated the community, the New American Foundation's Anya French has predicted that they may pressure both countries to step even closer toward normalization. It might be a slow process, but it only seems to be moving in one direction."	78	"[{""start"": 963, ""end"": 1103, ""text"": ""he Cuban government has announced it will lift the onerous, expensive and often prohibitive restrictions on foreign travel for its citizens"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1105, ""end"": 1295, ""text"": ""It's impossible to say for sure why Havana has taken down this piece of the political-economic wall separating Cuba from the rest of the world, but it seems like the reasons may be economic."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1105, ""end"": 1294, ""text"": ""It's impossible to say for sure why Havana has taken down this piece of the political-economic wall separating Cuba from the rest of the world, but it seems like the reasons may be economic"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2558, ""end"": 2922, ""text"": ""re Cuban economic immigrants come into the United States, and start to outnumber the Cuban political refugees that have long dominated the community, the New American Foundation's Anya French has predicted that they may pressure both countries to step even closer toward normalization.

"Three months after taking office in 2009, President Obama brought up Cuba at the Summit of the Americas. ""I know there is a longer journey that must be traveled to overcome decades of mistrust,"" he told the crowd, which did not include any representatives from Cuba, ""but there are critical steps we can take toward a new day."" In the five years since, long-standing restrictions on travel and trade have been loosened and rhetoric has continued to focus on improving relations. This week, an American held by Cuba for five years was brought home, and the White House announced plans to open an embassy in Havana. To call this a big change for U.S.-Cuba relations somehow feels like understatement, given those simmering decades of discontent and distrust, which have functioned as a museum-quality live exhibit of the Cold War for all the people born after it ended. Here's the backstory to help you get up to speed. In 1959, revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro overthrew the Batista government. Castro's relationship with the Soviet Union, among other factors, led President Dwight D. Eisenhower to cease diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961. The Embassy in Cuba had been legislated about 38 years earlier, and the United States recognized the independence of the country less than 60 years before — at the same time they began leasing land at Guantanamo Bay. As President John F. Kennedy took office in late January 1961, plans were already in place to overthrow Castro. In April of that year came the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, in which more than 1,000 Cuban exiles, trained by the CIA, invaded the country and were quickly defeated by Castro's far larger army. The mission embarrassed the White House and cemented the bad feelings between the two nations. (Cuba heartily celebrated what they saw as the 50th anniversary of their defeat of American imperialism in 2011.) A year later, a full economic embargo stopped nearly all trade and travel between the United States and Cuba. A U.S. plane photographed Soviet nuclear missile sites in Cuba in October 1962, which led to a naval quarantine of the island — an effort to stop further delivery of weapons — and a brief moment when some officials thought that nuclear war might actually happen, events otherwise known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The 13 days of White House talks that resolved the crisis were inevitably memorialized in a Kevin Costner action movie, featuring one of his best attempts to capture an accent. For the rest of the Cold War, restrictions and diplomatic attempts waxed and waned, but no serious changes in the two countries' formal relationship changed. In 1982, the State Department put Cuba on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. During the 1992 presidential election, another reason for continuing the United States' policy toward Cuba was born — the promise of attracting conservative Cuban American voters who approved of the embargo. The New York Times published this telling paragraph in October 1992: ""I think this Administration has missed a big opportunity to put the hammer down on Fidel Castro and Cuba,"" Mr. Clinton told hundreds of cheering Cuban-Americans at a dinner that raised $125,000 for his campaign. In March 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which was a reaction to an attack on two civilian planes that left four Americans dead. The law tightened the existing embargo. Pope John Paul II tried to push the White House toward easing the embargo, saying that the sanctions were ""oppressive, unjust and ethically unacceptable."" In 1999, the Baltimore Orioles played an exhibition game in Havana. The Baltimore Sun wrote at the time: ""Baseball could do for Cuban-American relations what Ping-Pong diplomacy did in paving the way for the Nixon administration's opening to China in the 1970s. But it is no sure thing."" At the end of the year, 5-year-old Elian Gonzalez was the only survivor on a raft coming from Cuba. A long legal battle between the child's relatives in Miami and his family in Cuba ended with the boy returning to Cuba. He told CNN in 2013 that the United States' ""unjust embargo provokes an internal and critical economic situation in Cuba."" President George W. Bush continued many of the same policies as Bill Clinton. In a 2002 speech, he once again, like all presidents before him, affirmed the United States' desire to see more democracy in Cuba — as well as the federal government's belief that opening up trade would ruin all hope of that happening. ""It's important for Americans to understand, without political reform, without economic reform,"" Bush said, ""trade with Cuba will merely enrich Fidel Castro and his cronies."" Bush said similar things in 2007. ""As long as the regime maintains its monopoly over the political and economic life of the Cuban people,"" he said, ""the United States will keep the embargo in place."" Raul Castro, who had taken over for his aging brother, published an essay called ""Bush, Hunger and Death"" soon after Bush's affirmation of existing foreign policy was announced. Castro wrote that Bush was ""threatening humanity with World War III, this time with atomic weapons."" President Obama's administration has featured a slow thaw in the decades of tension with Cuba. In the spring of 2009, the White House and Congress made it possible for Americans to send remittances to Cuba, or visit family members there. The policy was very different from what the United States had been doing for decades, but Obama used the same rationale, saying that the move was made to promote democracy in the region. In December 2009, American USAID contractor Alan Gross was arrested in Cuba and accused of being a U.S. spy. The Cuban government said they would only release Gross if the United States agreed to release five Cuban spies caught in Florida. The push for stopping the embargo and renewing diplomatic relations continued. In October, the United Nations voted for the 23rd time to condemn the embargo. The United States and Israel have been the only states to vote against the measure in recent votes. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton wrote in her recently published book ""Hard Choices"": Near the end of my tenure I recommended to President Obama that he take another look at our embargo. It wasn’t achieving its goals and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America. After twenty years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive. She told Fusion in July that she'd like to visit Cuba some day. Meanwhile, newspaper travel sections are publishing stories on the legal possibilities of visiting Cuba and meeting a dairy farmer, and advising that you always bring extra toilet paper. Raul Castro and Obama shook hands at Nelson Mandela's memorial service, which was quickly imbued with much meaning by all those who noticed. Many elected officials, especially Republicans, saw the shake as a mistake. ""Why should you shake hands with someone who's keeping Americans in prison?"" Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain told Public Radio International. ""Neville Chamberlain shook hands with Hitler."" Cuban Americans in Florida, once a reliable Republican voting bloc, have increasingly voted for Democrats. Public support for renewing diplomatic relations with Cuba has grown over the past decade. In an interview with the Miami Herald earlier in December, Bill Clinton said: “I think we would be well on our way to doing it [ending the blockade] if they released Alan Gross. It is really foolish to allow what is clearly a questionable incarceration to imperil the whole future of U.S.-Cuban relations, but that’s not my call to make."" On Wednesday, Obama announced that Cuba relations were finally about to change in a big way. “We can’t keep doing the same thing over five decades and expect a different result,"" he said during a televised address. This includes rethinking the state's designation as a sponsor of terrorism and easing sanctions. Secretary of State John Kerry has previously alluded to allowing Cuba to attend the Summit of the Americas next year — for the first time. This year's summit will spend a large chunk of time discussing human rights and democracy, according to Kerry. Republicans' reactions to the change in diplomatic relations with Cuba have not featured much rejoicing, ensuring that this will be a much-debated topic in the 114th Congress and 2016 presidential election. (Only Congress can formally normalize relations and approve the construction of an embassy.) On Jan. 3, 1961, a mere 53 years ago, Eisenhower made a statement announcing the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Cuba. ""It is my hope and my conviction that in the not-too-distant future it will be possible for the historic friendship between us once again to find its reflection in normal relations of every sort,"" Eisenhower said. Today, Obama took a big step toward doing just that."	77	"[{""start"": 328, ""end"": 478, ""text"": ""In the five years since, long-standing restrictions on travel and trade have been loosened and rhetoric has continued to focus on improving relations."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 479, ""end"": 612, ""text"": ""This week, an American held by Cuba for five years was brought home, and the White House announced plans to open an embassy in Havana"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 479, ""end"": 612, ""text"": ""This week, an American held by Cuba for five years was brought home, and the White House announced plans to open an embassy in Havana"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 3442, ""end"": 3596, ""text"": ""Pope John Paul II tried to push the White House toward easing the embargo, saying that the sanctions were \""oppressive, unjust and ethically unacceptable.\"""", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4105, ""end"": 4227, ""text"": ""He told CNN in 2013 that the United States' \""unjust embargo provokes an internal and critical economic situation in Cuba.\"""", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5196, ""end"": 5289, ""text"": ""President Obama's administration has featured a slow thaw in the decades of tension with Cuba"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5291, ""end"": 5433, ""text"": ""In the spring of 2009, the White House and Congress made it possible for Americans to send remittances to Cuba, or visit family members there."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6214, ""end"": 6592, ""text"": ""Near the end of my tenure I recommended to President Obama that he take another look at our embargo.

"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) offered a gentle criticism Tuesday of sugar tycoon Alfonso Fanjul, who revealed in a Washington Post interview this week that he had quietly traveled to Cuba and had an “open mind” about doing business with the communist regime “under the right circumstances.” According to an e-mail from Rubio’s spokesman, Alex Conant,  the senator “was surprised and disappointed to read about Alfonso Fanjul’s new position on the Cuban trade embargo. We should not ignore the systemic violations of human rights in Cuba for the sake of opening up new business opportunities.” The statement from Rubio, who has credited the Fanjul family with raising money and helping him establish political connections during a critical time in his 2010 Senate race, was far more muted than the angry reactions that have come over the past day from two of his fellow Cuban American lawmakers. His softer tone illustrates the awkward position for Rubio, a Cuban American who has staked out a hard-line, pro-sanctions position on Cuba but who relies on the Fanjuls’ campaign donations and fundraising clout. Fanjul is a Democratic donor and likely ally of Hillary Clinton should she run for president in 2016. But if Rubio runs for the Republican presidential nomination, Fanjul’s brother, Pepe Sr., a donor to GOP causes, would likely play a key fundraising role behalf of his fellow Cuban American. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) said Fanjul’s actions were “shameful” and “pathetic,” while Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) called them a “betrayal.” In the interview with The Post, Fanjul stopped short of declaring all-out opposition to the trade embargo. But he looked forward to a time that the embargo no longer existed and did not make the fall of the Castro regime a condition for him to do business there. The sugar magnate, who left Cuba as a young man and became a key funder of anti-Castro causes, said his primary goal was to “unite the Cuban family.” He said he was open to investing in Cuba if U.S. law were to change and if he and other investors could be guaranteed a reasonable rate of return. Fanjul said he traveled to Cuba twice – in April 2012 and February 2013 – and had high-level meetings with Cuban government officials. He toured an old sugar mill that had been built, he said, by Russians under the Castro regime. And he associated himself with recent reports by the Brookings Institution, which organized the trips, calling for a dramatic loosening of sanctions. Fanjul sits on the Brookings board and has donated at least $200,000 to the think tank in recent years. His visits to Cuba, combined with his openness to doing business there, was enough to set off a political bomb of sorts in Cuban American politics. Here is Rubio’s full statement: “Senator Rubio was surprised and disappointed to read about Alfonso Fanjul’s new position on the Cuban trade embargo. We should not ignore the systemic violations of human rights in Cuba for the sake of opening up new business opportunities. The story confirms why Senator Rubio so strongly believes we must keep the trade embargo in place.  American businesses creating joint ventures with the Castro Regime would provide further financial and material support to the Cuban dictatorship that denies basic freedoms, violates human rights, and remains engaged in hostile actions toward the United States and its allies. And it would convert these businesses into allies of the Castro regime for the sake of protecting their investments and profits. Senator Rubio strongly believes prematurely lifting the trade embargo would remove any leverage the United States has to promote democracy in Cuba.” Read about Ros-Lehtinen’s statement here. And here is the statement, issued late last night, from Diaz-Balart: ""I am outraged by reports that a fellow Cuban-American, who has witnessed the atrocities inflicted by the Castro regime, has apparently chosen short-term profit over standing with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. Some might be blind to the Castro regime's brutality and ruthless oppression, but Alfonso Fanjul's betrayal is compounded because he knows better.
