comprehensive package of protection” against the “hazards and vicissitudes of life” is tantamount to political suicide. Hillary Clinton has stated that she doesn’t want to roll back Social Security benefits in any way. In fact, she wants to expand the program. Donald Trump, meanwhile, hasn’t laid out any specific policy points on Social Security, but he has said that he opposes any cuts to benefits. Are the most popularly proposed Social Security reforms — raising the retirement age, reforming cost-of-living adjustments or expanding the withholding tax — fair to retirees and workers? If not, what should be done to make the program sustainable going forward?   Eugene Steuerle is the Richard Fisher chair at the Urban Institute, co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and author of “Dead Men Ruling.” He blogs at “The Government We Deserve.” No one should assess Social Security policy in isolation. What is fair in Social Security must relate to what is fair for the national budget as a whole. Congressional Budget Office projections indicate that by 2026 we’ll be 21 percent richer, and that tax revenues will rise at a slightly higher rate. That means we stand before an ocean of opportunity. But of the expected $850 billion in additional real revenues, about 150 percent (or about $1.3 trillion) is committed entirely to increasingly expensive payments to Social Security, health care and interest on the debt. And as a result of these commitments, almost anything that represents investment — in our children, infrastructure or the basic functions of government — takes it on the chin. Even as revenues grow, the number of workers available to pay for Social Security benefits is falling rapidly, meaning that either benefits must be cut, taxes increased, or both. Every delay puts more of the cost on the young. Social Security maintains a design built around an economy and family structure of the past. People aged 65 now live about six years longer and retire even earlier than they did in 1940 when the system first paid benefits. That means families like Clinton’s, Trump’s and mine will be getting hundreds of thousands of dollars more in lifetime benefits than they would have when the system was first created, while many future elderly will still be left in poverty. So what must be done? Slow down and reorient the growth in benefits scheduled for future retirees. A typical couple retiring today gets more than $1 million in lifetime Social Security and Medicare benefits; millennials are unrealistically scheduled to get $2 million.  That growth can be slowed without being stopped and shifted more toward those who are truly old with low- to moderate-incomes. While Social Security’s long-recognized shortfalls inevitably mean someone must pay, those with above-median incomes are the ones with the money. Still, no Social Security benefits need to be cut for those currently retired. To do better for those elderly with median or lower lifetime incomes, we should raise minimum benefits and give credit for raising children. We should also fix absurd rules around spousal and survivor benefits and other sources of inequity. The current system discourages work in late-middle age, something that is no longer easily affordable and which reduces economic growth, personal income and tax revenues. Congress should reduce Social Security’s natural disincentives for work both by adjusting the retirement age as we live longer and saving a larger share of lifetime benefits for later ages, when health needs rise and work is less possible. As lifespan increases, Social Security now promises a typical newly retired couple aged 62 an average of more than 28 years of benefits (today, one of them is likely to make it to 90 years of age). That’s more than enough; there are greater societal needs than the desire for more retirement years. Finally, the tax issue. While some broadening of the Social Security tax base is possible, government needs to concentrate on raising revenue for high priorities apart from Social Security: our growing national debt, and vital investments such as education, infrastructure and support for working families. Campaigns are about giveaways, but true reform requires looking at what must be done and how, whether we want to or not.

That's the percentage of Americans who have debts and unpaid bills reported to collection agencies, a study says. Wonkbook’s Chart of the Day: This chart shows how Congress prevents the gloom and doom in Medicare trustee reports from ever coming true. Wonkbook's Top 4 Stories: (1) The state of Medicare and Social Security; (2) the economy's big week; (3) the country's evolution on marijuana; (4) context on the VA deal. 1. Top story: Checking in on Medicare and Social Security's financial health Medicare gets new lease on life thanks to ACA, hospital expenses. ""Medicare’s financial stability has been strengthened by the Affordable Care Act and other forces that have been subduing health-care spending, according to a new official forecast that says the fund covering the program’s hospital costs will remain solvent until 2030 — four years later than expected a year ago....The trustees welcomed the improved financial prospects for Medicare but acknowledged that the underlying reasons are not yet entirely understood....The trustees’ forecast said that the trust fund that pays for hospital care — Medicare Part A — has been strengthened significantly."" Amy Goldstein in The Washington Post. Primary sources: The full texts of the Medicare report and the Social Security report. The Washington Post. Will the slowdown in health spending last? Who knows. ""There's a whole lot of uncertainty...whether it's due to the sluggish economy or structural changes in the health-care system. How long can the slowdown last?...The trustees' report highlights the truly difficult task of predicting Medicare's future....Another source of uncertainty for Medicare's future is the ACA itself. The law calls for $415 billion in reduced payments to care providers, while at the same time trying to encourage providers to adopt care models that cut costs and provide better outcomes. Whether care can be truly reformed is a question that Medicare's best prognosticators still can't answer, but they said recent signs have been encouraging."" Jason Millman in The Washington Post. Chart: Is Medicare going broke? No. ""This report has predicted, many times in the past, that the Medicare Trust Fund would run out of money. But...each time the projected insolvency date gets close, there's typically a pattern where Congress steps in and passes some type of policy to make trust fund dollars stretch at least a decade longer....The projected date of insolvency speaks to a world where Congress never changes anything about Medicare, the world of health financing stays static, and, if we keep spending payroll tax dollars at current rates, the fund can't pay its bills. In other words, the date of projected insolvency speaks to a world that doesn't really exist."" Sarah Kliff in Vox. But in today's age, will Congress to act when needed? ""There is little appetite in Congress to tackle such big issues. However, the longer Congress waits to act, the more difficult it will become to avoid either large tax increases or significant benefit cuts in both programs, said economist Charles Blahous III, one of two public trustees....If Congress acts quickly, Social Security could be shored up for several generations through relatively modest changes to benefits and revenues. However, many advocates oppose any cuts to benefits, while many Republicans in Congress oppose any increase in taxes."" Stephen Ohlemacher and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Associated Press. Another wonky tidbit buried in the Medicare report: Trustees assume 'doc fix.' ""For 12 years now, the formula that Congress uses to pay Medicare doctors has fallen short of keeping doctor salaries steady. So...Congress passes a 'doc-fix:' a funding patch to keep physician salaries even, or given them a slight boost. In previous Medicare Trustees' reports, the authors would never assume that they would pass this fix — they would only operate on the baseline of what law is standing right now....After 12 years of watching doc-fixes pass and pass again...the Medicare Trustees' are acknowledging that our haphazard way of funding doctor salaries, with short-term payments, is likely here to stay."" Sarah Kliff in Vox. For Social Security, the outlook is more dire than the summary suggests. "" The largest Social Security program, for seniors, is on track for full funding through 2034, but Social Security’s disability benefits face a shortfall starting in 2016. Some forecasters say a jump in the number of beneficiaries in the disability program in recent years stems mostly from...a bulge of baby boomers at the prime age....The CBO estimated recently that closing the long-term gap for Social Security would require boosting the payroll tax by 3.54 percent of worker pay. Or, if Congress moved to expose all the pay of high-income workers to the tax, the payroll tax would still need to be raised on all workers (by 1.61 percentage points) unless other reforms were made."" Mark Trumbull in The Christian Science Monitor. Jack Lew calls for diverting payroll tax revenues to SSDI. Here's how that would work. ""SSDI gets its revenue largely from the payroll tax that workers and employers pay. The payroll tax rate is 6.2%. Of that, 5.3% goes to the Social Security fund that pays retiree benefits, and 0.9% goes to the disability insurance trust fund. The fund that pays benefits to retirees had $2.674 trillion at the end of 2013, so Mr. Lew’s point is that income should be diverted to buttress the disability fund because the retiree fund is on more solid footing. This change wouldn’t increase taxes, but it would change how tax dollars are spent."" Damian Paletta in The Wall Street Journal. In other financial news, what would the latest round of Russia sanctions do? ""While criticized at home as not being tough enough on Russia, Mr. Obama has been pressing Europe to stand firmer against Moscow. With their economies far more dependent on energy-rich Russia, the Europeans have until now imposed mainly modest sanctions....On Monday, they agreed to target a handful more individuals. But the package to be finalized Tuesday would go much further, matching and in some cases exceeding the actions Mr. Obama took on his own this month in blocking access to medium- and long-term American capital markets for some of Russia’s largest and most global banking and energy companies."" Jack Ewing and Peter Baker in The New York Times. Other financial reads: Banks cash in on mergers to cut taxes. Andrew Ross Sorkin in The New York Times. Top opinion SUNSTEIN: The poor need Ryan's regulation reform. ""True, under Ryan’s proposal, agencies could try to persuade Congress to enact any regulation that has regressive effects, but that brings us to the third problem. Because Congress is so frequently paralyzed, the consequence of this proposal would be to block highly desirable rules, many of which have already been subject to careful cost-benefit analysis. But let’s not lose the forest for the trees. Ryan is on the right track insofar as he suggests that occupational licensing is a big problem and that regulatory agencies should take steps to reduce or eliminate adverse effects on people who are struggling. Democrats and Republicans should be working together to solve the problems that Ryan has identified."" Cass R. Sunstein in Bloomberg View. MORGENTHAU: VA deal promising, but here's what it's missing. ""The draft bill is a step in the right direction and should be approved by the joint conference committee and passed by Congress before the August recess. But further steps are necessary to provide lasting care for veterans, particularly those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury. Treatment for combat-derived mental illness is a pressing problem that is overwhelming the VA and requires the assistance of our nation's best health-care facilities, including top teaching and clinical hospitals."" Robert Morgenthau in The Wall Street Journal. DOW: The day the death penalty died. ""The death penalty...is the sausage factory of America’s legal system: Nobody wants to know what is actually going on. So the states eventually embraced lethal injection as the preferred method....People sometimes ask me what it is like to witness an execution, and I tell them the most powerful thing about it is walking outside the prison after it is over, into the bright light of day, and seeing that the state has just killed someone, and the citizens don’t have a clue. We do know, however, when the end of the modern death-penalty era began: April 29, 2014. That was the day we could no longer remain willfully naive. It was the date Oklahoma executed Clayton Lockett."" David R. Dow inPolitico Magazine. DOUTHAT: The new Republican populism. ""In 2012, Mitt Romney won back the over-$200,000 vote, mostly by regaining ground in the suburbs around New York City. But what he didn’t win was the actual election, mostly because voters outside Greenwich and New Canaan decided that a G.O.P. obsessed with heroic entrepreneurs didn’t have their interests close to heart. So haltingly at first, and then with increasing seriousness, Republicans began to look for a different path back to power — one tailored to the party’s growing dependence on working-class votes, and one designed to deliver populist substance as well as style."" Ross Douthat in The New York Times. REYNOLDS: Supreme beings of leisure. ""We've seen repeated cycles of worry that automation would leave large swathes of the populace unemployed. Each time, we've instead seen new (generally better) jobs replacing the jobs that were destroyed. The conventional wisdom is that the same thing will happen now. People may be losing jobs to robots, but soon they'll get new jobs, fixing the robots, or selling them....But there are two objections to this....First, just because something has happened before doesn't mean it'll happen that way again. And second, the new jobs don't necessarily replace the old jobs for those who have lost them. There are reasons to worry about both."" Glenn Harlan Reynolds in USA Today. FLAVELLE: College cost isn't poor students' big problem. ""To judge by this summer's banner policy proposals, the most important question for higher-education reform right now is giving students easier access to loans. But evidence from Canada suggests those changes won't address the greater need: Getting more kids from poor families into college, the key to moving up in an increasingly unequal society....If the goal is to make loan payments for college graduates a little more manageable, this summer's proposals are promising. If the goal is making the distribution of income in the U.S. more meritocratic...then better loan terms probably won't help."" Christopher Flavelle in Bloomberg View. Science interlude: How much sleep do people actually need? 2. A big week for the economy Christmas in July for economists. ""The Federal Reserve Board's policymakers are meeting over two days this week to...decide whether to continue the current policies that restrain interest rates....Wednesday...the Commerce Department will release its first estimate of GDP growth for the second quarter....Thursday...the USDA will report on farm prices....Friday: The Labor Department will release its July jobs report....In recent months, jobs have been growing rapidly. Did the pace continue in July? In addition, economists will be watching for lots of wild cards this week....Lawmakers could make decisions involving issues with big economic impacts, such as on immigration and federal highway spending."" Marilyn Geewax in NPR. Explainer: 5 things to watch on the economic calendar this week. Kathleen Madigan in The Wall Street Journal. The U.S. economy has woken from its winter hibernation, but the damage is done. ""Gross domestic product likely grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate, according to a Reuters survey of economists, lifted by an acceleration in both consumer spending and stock accumulation by businesses....Earlier in the second quarter, growth estimates were as high as 4 percent, but they were lowered as consumer spending and business investment rebounded less than expected. With output having contracted at a 2.9 percent pace in the January-March period, first-half growth was likely flat. As such, growth for the year as a whole could average below 2 percent."" Lucia Mutikani in Reuters. Charts: U.S. government serves as lone star of first quarter. Eric Morath in The Wall Street Journal. Fed policymakers are divided over when to raise rates. ""Many...want to avoid moving rates up until they are sure the economy is on stronger footing, a view supported by Ms. Yellen in her recent testimony and likely to hold at the coming meeting. Most policy makers in this camp see short-term rates staying near zero until well into next year....Fed officials also will keep working on their blueprint for how they will raise interest rates when the time comes....Among the issues on the table: when to start shrinking the central bank's $4.1 trillion bond portfolio."" Jon Hilsenrath in The Wall Street Journal. Explainer: The Fed’s five (not so) easy steps back to normal. Ylan Q. Mui in The Washington Post. The IMF's warning on rates to the Fed. ""The IMF suggests the Fed should think twice before relegating...the federal funds rate, to a supporting role. Minutes of the Fed’s June meeting showed central bank officials agreed they will use a newer interest rate — the rate it pays banks to park their reserves at the central bank overnight — as their primary tool for raising short-term rates broadly....The IMF also says it might be a good idea to stick to a single interest rate rather than adopting a system based on several rates, including the rate on banks’ excess reserves."" Pedro Nicolaci da Costa in The Wall Street Journal. And advice on forward guidance. ""The Federal Reserve’s various efforts at honing its low-rates message have been successful at keeping borrowing costs down by giving investors greater clarity about the likely path of policy, according to the International Monetary Fund. However, the policy’s effectiveness has varied depending on the type of guidance used, the IMF study on the U.S. economy said, published this week as part of its global economic forecasts. The Fed’s guidance has shifted quite a few times in recent years."" Pedro Nicolaci da Costa in The Wall Street Journal. Obama is running out of time to fill 2 remaining Fed board seats. ""The White House hasn’t nominated anyone for the seats on the seven-member board, and even someone submitted this week wouldn’t be confirmed until two weeks after the Nov. 4 elections, if history is any guide: the Senate has taken an average of 119 days to confirm Obama’s 10 Fed Board nominations since 2009....For the White House, the Fed is taking a back seat to crises foreign and domestic, from strife in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S. health care and immigration."" Jeff Kearns in Bloomberg. Pending sales of existing homes unexpectedly fall. ""Fewer Americans than forecast signed contracts to buy previously owned homes in June, a sign residential real estate is struggling to strengthen. The index of pending home sales declined 1.1 percent from the month before after rising 6 percent in May, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed....Limited availability of credit and sluggish wage growth are making it harder for prospective buyers to take the plunge, threatening to throttle the pace of the housing recovery. Continued gains in employment and a bigger supply of available homes will be needed to help accelerate the industry’s progress, which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said is lackluster."" Victoria Stilwell in Bloomberg. Other economic reads: Export-Import Bank faces danger from all sides. Eric Bradner in Politico. FISHER: The danger of too loose, too long. ""I have grown increasingly concerned about the risks posed by current monetary policy....The Fed has been running a hyper-accommodative monetary policy to lift the economy out of the doldrums and counteract a possible deflationary spiral....But with low interest rates and abundant availability of credit in the nondepository market, the bond markets and other trading markets have spawned an abundance of speculative activity....There are some who believe that 'macroprudential supervision' will safeguard us from financial instability. I am more skeptical."" Richard W. Fisher in The Wall Street Journal. VINIK: Inflation hawks have been wrong for years. Should we listen now? ""Fisher and his fellow inflation hawks...want to tighten policy now to make sure that inflation stays under control. But doing so would mean blocking real wage growth for workers, something they haven’t seen in more than a decade. On the other hand, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who has the best record of forecasting the economy out of any of her Fed colleagues, wants to keep monetary policy on its current trajectory and adjust it if inflation increases. In the meantime, she will allow wage growth to happen and continue, rightly, to ignore inflation hawks like Fisher and Santelli."" Danny Vinik in The New Republic. Scaredy cat interlude: This cat, freaked out by the outdoors, tries to hide in a stranger's bag. 3. The country's cultural shift on marijuana A profound cultural shift on marijuana legalization that long preceded the NYT editorial. ""These are not new arguments. But this time they come from the New York Times, not High Times. Support for marijuana legalization has grown so rapidly within the last decade, and especially within the last two years, that some advocates and pollsters have compared it with the sudden collapse of opposition to same-sex marriage as a culture-redefining event....Yet through a combination of ballot measures, legislative action and judicial action, same-sex marriage has found far more success across the U.S., in a campaign supporters liken to the civil rights movement."" Matt Pearce and Maria L. La Ganga in the Los Angeles Times. Charts: The Times was surprisingly late to the legalization party. Philip Bump in The Washington Post. At Colorado’s borders, a dividing line over marijuana. ""It should be no shock that as attitudes toward marijuana have shifted, fault lines have appeared along state boundaries. On the Great Plains east of the Rockies, a three-hour drive from Denver’s profusion of pot shops — 340 medical and recreational at last count — Colorado’s bold social experiment is confounding parents who have to explain to their children why this alluring but troubling substance is legal just down the road, a state line — and a cultural divide — away. The same policy decisions that liberated pot smokers in Colorado are filling tiny rural jails in Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming."" Marc Fisher in The Washington Post. Explainer: Which states are voting on marijuana this year? German Lopez in Vox. How stoned is too stoned to drive? The feds want to know. ""A small group of volunteers spent much of the last year getting drunk and stoned on marijuana furnished by the federal government before getting behind the wheel. The volunteers were part of what federal scientists say was the most comprehensive study ever conducted on how marijuana, and pot combined with alcohol, affect drivers. The data now being analyzed ultimately will help regulators decide how stoned is too stoned to drive. It's similar to the studies conducted to develop levels for drunken driving. Volunteers were recruited from around Iowa City, home to the University of Iowa's National Advanced Driving Simulator."" Trevor Hughes in USA Today. Explainer: What are the risks of marijuana? More than many realize. Liz Szabo in USA Today. Pot issue unnerves 2016 contenders. ""In presidential politics, pot is being treated as a dangerous substance. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have signaled varying degrees of support for medicinal marijuana. Yet at a time when the majority of Americans say recreational pot use should be legal, and two states have already made it so, none of the top-tier 2016 presidential prospects in either party has gone that far."" Jonathan Allen and Jennifer Oldham in Bloomberg. Moms' marijuana-for-kids campaign seeks to quiet epilepsy. ""The lack of scientific evidence hasn’t kept the parents of children with severe epilepsy from turning to it, though, based on anecdotal evidence carried across the Internet. After Sintz first heard about the compound, she joined and helped lead a nonprofit called Hope 4 Children with Epilepsy that set up educational events and lobbied state lawmakers in a campaign that resulted in Utah becoming one of just 11 states to allow use of the marijuana extract by youngsters, all coming this year. Twenty-three states allow medical use of marijuana for other conditions including cancer, glaucoma and HIV/AIDS. Utah’s health department last week began issuing registration cards."" Marie French in Bloomberg. Meanwhile, another win for gay marriage. ""A federal appeals court on Monday struck down Virginia’s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage....The 2-to-1 decision by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, upheld a lower court’s decision....Legal challenges to state bans filed systematically nationwide have prevailed in every test since the Supreme Court in June 2013 struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act....Two federal appeals courts have now said the bans are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court probably will have to make the final determination and could consider the issue as soon as next year."" Robert Barnes and Jenna Portnoy in The Washington Post. N.C. attorney general says state will stop defending its ban in response to ruling. ""North Carolina’s attorney general said Monday that the state would stop defending its same-sex marriage ban against legal challenges, just hours after a federal appeals court ruled that a similar ban in Virginia is unconstitutional. At a news conference Monday afternoon, Atty. Gen. Roy Cooper said he had made the decision because the appeals court ruling 'predicts our law will be struck down.'""

More details on the VA agreement Why the VA agreement should pass easily before recess starts. ""In addition to approving changes to veterans’ medical care, negotiators are working on deals to continue federal funding for the nation’s major road projects and whether to grant President Obama’s request for billions of dollars to deal with the historic influx of illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border. Members of both parties have been warning for weeks that leaving Washington before responding to allegations of mismanaged or delayed care at VA medical facilities nationwide would reflect poorly on Congress."" Ed O'Keefe in The Washington Post. The rising costs of veterans' care and benefits. ""The VA is now among the largest federal agencies. After scaling back its operations in the 1990s...the VA found itself unprepared for the influx of veterans from recent wars and the aging of the Vietnam War generation. Between 2002 and 2013, the medical staff grew...while the number of annual outpatient visits nearly doubled to 86.4 million. Hospital admissions — the biggest driver of costs in most hospitals — rose 23% to almost 695,000. In all, medical spending climbed from $29.8 billion to $54.2 billion....But the biggest increase in spending was on disability and pension pay for disabled veterans."" Alan Zarembo in the Los Angeles Times.

  This is an updated version of The Fact Checker’s guide to Social Security and how it is financed. The details of Social Security are often misunderstood, making it a frequent subject of political hyperbole and misinformation. This primer is intended to answer basic questions about the program. What is Social Security? Social Security was created in response to the pervasive poverty during the Great Depression. It is designed to provide workers with a basic level of income in retirement, as well as disability pay and life insurance while they work. About 70 percent of the 57 million beneficiaries are retired workers; the rest are disabled workers, dependents or survivors. The benefits are progressive, meaning lower-income workers get a relatively better deal than higher-income workers; however, workers making above a certain salary ($117,000 in 2014) don’t have to pay as much of their income into the system, though their benefits are capped too. (About six percent of workers earn above taxable maximum.) The benefits are inflation-adjusted after initial receipt, a feature that is almost impossible to find in the U.S. annuity market. The initial benefit formula is adjusted annually for growth in the Average Wage Index (AWI), which tends to rise faster than price inflation. This is why per capita Social Security benefits rise in real terms. How is Social Security financed? About 96 percent of workers must pay a certain amount of their paycheck, generally 6.2 percent, into the system, an amount that is matched by their employers. (Some state and local workers don’t participate in Social Security.) This results in a 12.4 percent tax on income, as most economists would agree that the full amount is taken from the worker’s wage compensation. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, which means that payments collected today are immediately used to pay benefits. Until recently, more payments were collected than were needed for benefits. So, Social Security loaned the money to the U.S. government, which used it for other things. In exchange, Social Security receives interest-bearing Treasury securities. The value of those bonds is now nearly $2.8 trillion. Why do some politicians label Social Security a ‘Ponzi scheme,’ meaning that it will eventually collapse? Because Social Security was not pre-funded, it depends heavily on the contributions of current workers. The baby-boom generation has begun to retire, reducing the number of workers per retiree. Meanwhile, people are living longer and thus would collect benefits longer, while parents are not having as many children, which limits the pool of new workers. Wages for many Americans have also stagnated in recent decades. Largely because of the Great Recession, payroll collections now are not covering all benefit payments, and in 2010, Social Security started to tap its trust funds. Most experts predict that the demographic, life expectancy and fertility trends will continue even after the baby-boom generation passes. Indeed, after years of running a cash surplus, Social Security now has a negative cash flow (excluding interest income from bonds, which is paid in more bonds). And that means that in recent years the Treasury has had to go into the private market and issue bonds to investors on Wall Street and overseas in order to make good a relatively small percentage of benefit payments — about $75 billion in 2013. (Contrary to the view of some commentators, this is not a controversial statement. It comes directly from the Social Security Trustees report: “The Trustees project that this cash-flow deficit will average about $75 billion between 2013 and 2018 before rising steeply.” See also pages 223-224.) But in any case, Social Security is not a “Ponzi scheme,” meaning a fraudulent investment vehicle with a nonexistent investment strategy, which usually collapses within a few years. Why do some people say the trust funds have nothing but IOUs? IOU is just a pejorative way of saying “bond.” These bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Until the 2011 debt-ceiling impasse, one could not imagine that any president or Congress would risk defaulting on them because it would damage the nation’s financial standing. Still, Treasury bonds are considered a good bet — deemed to be one of the safest places to keep money. But, then, doesn’t the government have to pay for them somehow? This is where it gets confusing. The bonds are a real asset to Social Security, but they also represent an obligation of the rest of the government. Like any entity that issues debt, such as a corporation, the government will have to make good on its obligations, generally by taking the money out of revenue, reducing expenses or issuing new debt. The action taken really depends on the resources available at the time. There is nothing particularly unusual about this, except that the U.S. government is better placed to make good on these obligations than virtually any other debt-issuer. Some analysts, however, question whether the Social Security system holding those bonds lowers the cost of paying benefits relative to if the system did not hold them. Since the bonds have to be redeemed by general taxpayers, as a group taxpayers have to provide the same level of revenues to finance benefit payments as if Social Security were not holding any bonds. So then the question becomes whether the fact that Social Security ran these surpluses in the past improved the government’s overall fiscal position and thereby made it easier for the government to finance the total level of upcoming benefit payments. Some analysts contend that the existence of the earlier Social Security surpluses spurred lawmakers to spend more, resulting in higher public debt. Meanwhile, Democrats sometimes claim that Social Security “has not added one penny to the deficit.” The complexity of the financing makes this a confusing topic, but we have previously warned that readers should be wary of such assertions. You don’t get something for nothing. Why wasn’t the surplus cash generated by Social Security placed in stocks or something else? That has been an option discussed from time to time, though people were concerned about government control of corporate assets and having retirement funds subject to market swings. But it’s important to remember that if the $2.8 trillion now in the Social Security trust funds had been invested in some other security, not only would the value of the trust funds be subject to more volatility, but all things being equal, the publicly held debt of the United States would be $2.8 trillion higher today. That’s because for years the Social Security surpluses were used to help fund government operations, thus reducing the overall budget deficit at the time. Is there anything wrong with issuing new debt as benefits exceed tax revenue? Issuing new debt is a choice with certain consequences. It is one thing to issue debt to build schools; it is another thing to build up debt to finance the expenses of the elderly. When the government issues new debt and the economy is near full employment, it crowds out capital formation and ultimately passes on a smaller economy to future generations. (In an economy with high unemployment after a recession, many economists would say the impact of borrowing on capital formation is greatly reduced.) Policymakers will have to decide whether it is more important to worry about people alive 20 years from now or people alive 50 years from now. Some believe future generations will be richer and more productive, and thus able to afford the bill. Currently, however, Social Security costs are rising relative to the earnings of workers, indicating that the United States’ economic capacity is not keeping up with the rate of growth of Social Security obligations. In the end, the ability to pay benefits will be determined by how big the economy is at the time, not necessarily what kinds of assets are held by Social Security. At the moment, the government’s finances are such that it has no choice but to issue more debt to make payments. Would creating individual accounts, as Republicans advocate from time to time, also require more debt? Yes, if the accounts are funded out of existing payroll taxes, which was favored by then-President George W. Bush when he unsuccessfully attempted to overhaul the system. Creating such accounts would require Social Security to tap the trust fund even faster. That is because the system would need to keep paying current beneficiaries while also funding nascent accounts for people who are not likely to retire for decades. If no new source of revenue is added, some sort of loan, potentially worth trillions of dollars, may be needed to help bridge the financing gap in the early decades of a revised program. Are there other ways to deal with a financing gap in Social Security? In the past, payroll taxes have been increased and benefits have been adjusted. Some propose eliminating the cap on income subject to payroll taxes. The effective retirement age has been increased as people are living longer. More recently, President Obama has proposed achieving savings by adjusting the index used to calculate cost-of-living increases. This idea, which has Democratic roots, is intended to more accurately reflect how people react to price increases — but Obama’s plan was opposed by many Democrats on Capitol Hill because it was perceived as a benefit cut. It’s important to remember that Social Security does not run out of money or go “broke” even when its key trust fund is exhausted in 2035, as projected in the 2013 Social Security trustees report. The report says that tax income would be sufficient to pay about 72 percent of scheduled benefits through 2087. Even with current trends, the program will be there, although with reduced benefits if absolutely no changes are made — which is not politically likely. However, it is worth noting that the trust fund for disability payments (DI) is expected to be depleted in 2016. Although many people refer to the trust funds as a combined entity, the depletion of the DI fund might change the focus. Without new legislation, benefits for the disabled will be cut by 20 percent in 2016.  It seems like I put a lot of money into Social Security and won’t get a lot back. Social Security was never intended to generate wealth, but rather to supply an income floor. You are paying not only for retirement benefits, but also for disability and life insurance. Moreover, wealthier people are helping subsidize poorer workers. We also are paying for the fact that as the system was set up and expanded, earlier generations of retirees got much more in benefits than they contributed in payroll taxes. The Urban Institute has produced an interesting study which shows that a two-earner couple making an average wage retiring in 1960 received eight times in Social Security benefits what they paid in taxes — while a similar couple turning 65 in 2010 would have expected to get only about one-third more in benefits than what they paid in taxes.

For the first time since the New Deal, a majority of Americans are headed toward a retirement in which they will be financially worse off than their parents, jeopardizing a long era of improved living standards for the nation’s elderly, according to a growing consensus of new research. The Great Recession and the weak recovery darkened the retirement picture for significant numbers of Americans. And the full extent of the damage is only now being grasped by experts and policymakers. There was already mounting concern for the long-term security of the country’s rapidly graying population. Then the downturn destroyed 40 percent of Americans’ personal wealth, while creating a long period of high unemployment and an environment in which savings accounts pay almost no interest. Although the surging stock market is approaching record highs, most of these gains are flowing to well-off Americans who already are in relatively good shape for retirement. Liberal and conservative economists worry that the decline in retirement prospects marks a historic shift in a country that previously has fostered generations of improvement in the lives of the elderly. It is likely to have far-reaching implications, as an increasing number of retirees may be forced to double up with younger relatives or turn to social-service programs for support. “This is the first time that Americans are going to be relatively worse off than their parents or grandparents in old age,” said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research. Advocates for older Americans are calling on the federal government to bolster Social Security benefits or to create a new layer of retirement help for future retirees. Others want employers and the government to do more to encourage retirement savings and to discourage workers from using the money for non-retirement purposes. But those calls have been overwhelmed by concern about the nation’s fast-growing long-term debt, which has left many policy­makers focused on ways to trim Social Security and other retirement benefits rather than increase them. The economic downturn exacerbated long-term factors that were already eroding the financial standing of aging Americans: an inexorable rise in health-care costs, growing debt among older Americans and a shift in responsibility from employers to workers to plan for retirement. The consequence is that the nation is facing a huge retirement savings deficit — as much as $6.6 trillion, or about $57,000 per household, according to a U.S. Senate report. Using data on household finances collected by the Federal Reserve, the Center for Retirement Research estimates that 53 percent of American workers 30 and older are on a path that will leave them unprepared for retirement. That marks a sharp deterioration since 2001, when 38 percent of Americans were at risk of declining living standards in old age. In 1989, 30 percent faced that risk. The center’s findings are similar to those recently uncovered by researchers at the New School, the Heritage Foundation and the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “There is a mismatch between retirement needs rising and retirement benefits contracting,” said Alicia H. Munnell, director of Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. The precarious situation comes after a long period of change that improved life for the nation’s seniors starting with the enactment of Social Security in 1935. By the 1960s, retirees also benefitted from universal health insurance through Medicare and Medicaid, sharp increases in Social Security benefits and new protections enacted by the federal government for workers who received traditional pensions, which for decades were a standard employee benefit. The changes rescued millions of retirees from poverty, while lifting millions of others to prosperous retirements symbolized by vacation cruises, recreational vehicles and second homes. But now problems for future retirees seem to be closing in from all sides. Half of American workers have no retirement plans through their jobs, leaving people on their own to save for old age. Meanwhile, four out of five private-sector workers with retirement plans at work have only 401(k)-type defined contribution accounts, rather than traditional pensions that pay retirees a fixed benefit for life. Numerous studies have found that workers with defined-contribution accounts often put aside too little money, make too many withdrawals or employ the wrong investment strategies to save enough for old age. Overall, people ages 55 to 64 have a median retirement account balance of $120,000, Boston College researchers have found, which is enough to fund an annuity paying about $575 a month, far short of what they will need. Officials at money-management firms that handle 401(k)-type investments argue that the tools are in place for Americans to retire comfortably. The problem, they say, is that employers and workers are not using them correctly. Robert L. Reynolds, president and chief executive of Putnam Investments, noted that 2006 changes in federal law gave employers the power to automatically enroll workers in retirement accounts. But too few choose to do that and even when they do, companies typically set aside only 3 percent of pay — far less than the estimated 10 percent that experts say workers need to set aside to fund a sound retirement. “I would be adamant that there is nothing wrong with 401(k)s that can’t be fixed by taking better advantage of the current system,” Reynolds said. Daniel J. Houston, president of retirement, insurance and financial services at the Principal Financial Group, contended that defined contribution accounts are better tailored than old-fashioned pensions to today’s highly mobile workforce. Workers can take them when they switch jobs. But that control also is a weakness, allowing Americans to tap them for non-retirement purposes. The retirement savings shortfall is revealing an economic divide separating those who are well prepared for retirement from those who are not. Recent policy changes aimed at bolstering Americans’ retirement prospects have only contributed to the growing inequality. The government grants at least $80 billion a year in tax breaks to encourage retirement savings in 401(k)-type accounts. But the biggest benefits go to upper-income people who can afford to put aside the most for retirement, allowing them to reap the biggest tax breaks. Someone making $200,000 a year and contributing 15 percent of pay to a retirement account would receive about a $7,000 subsidy from the federal government in the form of a tax break, whereas workers earning $20,000 making the same 15 percent contribution would get nothing because they don’t earn enough to qualify for a deduction. Someone making $50,000 and making the 15 percent contribution would receive only about a $2,100 tax deduction. Even many of the diminishing share of workers who are enrolled in traditional pension programs face uncertainty as an increasing number of plans are under­funded, causing employers to freeze benefits. The hits to retirement income come as many Americans are living longer and health-care costs continue to grow, meaning they need to salt away more money for retirement. Workers have limited options for closing the gap. More are going to have to work longer. After many decades of decline, average retirement ages have already been creeping up in the past 20 years. A recent survey by the Conference Board found that nearly two-thirds of Americans ages 45 to 60 say they plan to delay retirement. Two years earlier, 42 percent said they would work longer. Some lawmakers and other advocates say the best way to cope with the growing gap would be to further expand Social Security and Medicare benefits, or to add another layer of taxpayer-subsidized savings that workers could use only for retirement. “We need to do more to help American families cope with this looming retirement crisis,” Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said at a hearing late last month. “Hard­working Americans deserve to be able to rest, take a vacation and spend more time with their grandkids when they get older.” But many policymakers are pushing to rein in the nation’s debt by trimming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits. Those programs are the primary drivers of the long-term deficit but are also financial mainstays for the vast majority of the nation’s retirees. Both Medicare and Social Security already are on course to provide reduced benefits for future retirees — reductions that will grow deeper if lawmakers follow through on new proposals to further trim the programs. With the Social Security retirement age moving to 67 under a federal law passed in 1983, people who leave the workforce earlier — and the vast majority do — will see smaller payouts. Health-care costs continue to outpace inflation, meaning more out-of-pocket expenses for future seniors. Retirees are also slated to pay more for their health care with Medicare premiums, which are deducted from the Social Security checks of senior citizens, set to rise from 12.2 percent to 14.9 percent by 2030. James G. Marzano, 60, was on his way to a comfortable retirement when he lost his job at a telecommunications firm in 2002. “People talk about a lost decade; that’s what I’ve been through,” he said. Marzano, a Tampa resident who is married to a retail worker and has a son who is a high school senior, spent most of the past decade in and out of contract jobs and other posts that paid far less than he was used to. He was forced to dip into his 401(k) account to make ends meet, and even now that he has found a good job, he says, his savings is maybe 60 percent of what it was 10 years ago. “If everything had stayed status quo from 2002 until 2012, I might be doing what I wanted to do today,” he said. “But, as it stands, I am nowhere near ready to retire.”	272	"[{""start"": 39, ""end"": 285, ""text"": ""a majority of Americans are headed toward a retirement in which they will be financially worse off than their parents, jeopardizing a long era of improved living standards for the nation’s elderly, according to a growing consensus of new research"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1162, ""end"": 1342, ""text"": ""t is likely to have far-reaching implications, as an increasing number of retirees may be forced to double up with younger relatives or turn to social-service programs for support"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4076, ""end"": 4194, ""text"": ""Half of American workers have no retirement plans through their jobs, leaving people on their own to save for old age."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 7177, ""end"": 7344, ""text"": ""The hits to retirement income come as many Americans are living longer and health-care costs continue to grow, meaning they need to salt away more money for retirement"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 8327, ""end"": 8449, ""text"": ""But many policymakers are pushing to rein in the nation’s debt by trimming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 8810, ""end"": 8991, ""text"": ""With the Social Security retirement age moving to 67 under a federal law passed in 1983, people who leave the workforce earlier — and the vast majority do — will see smaller payout"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	281	2023-03-28T08:55:26.957266Z	2023-03-28T08:55:26.957321Z	872.051
"Third Way has generously responded to my critique of its report alleging that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is crowding out spending on investments like education, research and development, and infrastructure. Given what good deals some of those investments are, this would be a serious problem indeed. But while it's clear that health care spending, including Medicare and Medicaid, is growing at an alarming rate that threatens other priorities, I don't think the evidence supports the view that Social Security is doing the same. Jim Kessler of Third Way disagrees: [Matthews] is correct, and we showed in our paper, that over the past 50 years, all of Social Security’s growth relative to GDP has occurred in the first 20 years and has stayed roughly static since. But five percent of the economy is a lot. It’s roughly equal to Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP combined. And it’s not going to stay static – that is a certainly. In less than two decades, Social Security is poised to jump from 5.0% to 6.0% of GDP, according to CBO. One point may not seem like a big deal, but it represents a 20% rise in the cost of Social Security relative to the size of the economy. No one disagrees that the retirement of the baby boomers is going to increase the cost of Social Security as a percentage of GDP. But it's worth noting that the increased cost does not deplete the Social Security trust fund until 2040, according to the CBO. And it got that trust fund because other programs kept borrowing from Social Security's revenues and are required by law to pay that debt back. So more and more of our Social Security obligations will take the form of debt repayment financed through general revenues, principally the personal income tax. One way to view this is as Kessler does, as Social Security ""crowding out"" other priorities in years to come. The other way to view it is that Social Security has been, in effect, subsidizing the rest of the government for decades and now it's their turn to pay it back. In that view, Social Security hasn't been crowding out other spending at all. It's been enabling it! The net effect on spending by the rest of the government, over the course of the loans and their repayment, is zero. So until 2040, talking about Social Security crowding out spending by the rest of the government is conceptually sort of weird. This becomes clearer if you compare changes in Social Security spending to changes in investment spending during the period studied by Third Way. If the ""crowding out"" story is true, there should be a substantial correlation between changes in Social Security spending, as a percentage of GDP, and changes in investment spending. But  there is no such correlation. Changes in Social Security spending only accounted for 2.4 percent of the change in total investment spending, 2.8 percent of the change in defense investment spending, and 2 percent of the change in non-defense investment spending. Not only that, but the correlation coefficients are positive - that is, increases in Social Security spending are actually mildly associated with increases in investment spending! This isn't to say that the two actually promote each other, just that there isn't really a relationship at all, historically. Kessler writes that ""These two areas of the budget – both of which are critical priorities for America, born of Democratic Presidents and Congresses – are locked in a zero sum game."" This is the bigger problem with his narrative. The way the Third Way paper talks about this, you'd get the impression that entitlements and investment spending together make up most of the federal budget. But they don't:"	271	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 229, ""text"": ""y has generously responded to my critique of its report alleging that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is crowding out spending on investments like education, research and development, and infrastructure"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 324, ""end"": 467, ""text"": ""ut while it's clear that health care spending, including Medicare and Medicaid, is growing at an alarming rate that threatens other prioritie"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	280	2023-03-28T08:40:50.747776Z	2023-03-28T08:40:50.747880Z	289.476
Here’s another reason to be concerned about income inequality: it poses a direct threat to the already shaky fiscal health of Social Security, according to a report released Tuesday by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The nation’s old-age pension and disability insurance program is funded by a payroll tax that this year applies to wages of $118,500 and below. But the amount of revenue coming in is not as large as it could be, now thatan increasing share of wage growth is going to people who make more than that, and the wages of many Americans are stagnant, or even in decline. That is adding fiscal stress to a program already struggling with the demands of an aging population. With more Americans reaching retirement age, Social Security is projected to eat through its funding reserves by 2033, assuming Congress took no action to bolster its finances. If that happened, Social Security trustees have said the program would be taking in only enough money to pay 75 percent of promised benefits—an unthinkable fate for a program that nearly two-thirds of seniors rely on for most of their retirement income. “Upward redistribution of income in the United States has meant that income has shifted away from the workers whose full earnings are taxed and toward high-income workers whose additional dollars are exempt,” read the report. The top 1 percent of wage earners took home about 12.9 percent of the nation’s total wage income in 2013–just short of the 13.7 percent that was earned by the entire bottom half of wage earners, the report said. And many of the richest Americans count on capital gains for most of their income, but capital gains are exempt from the payroll tax. The tax cap is adjusted each year in step with average wage growth year to year. Overall, some 17 percent of the nation’s wages escaped the tax, up from 10 percent in 1983. The increase in the share of wages exempt from the payroll tax has been jagged, but the upward drift has been unmistakable, as the chart below illustrates. The report says that the dire picture would be a bit different if wage increases had kept pace with the productivity gains of workers over the past three decades. Also, if the payroll tax covered the same 90 percent of earnings that it did in 1983, the program’s coffers would be $1.1 trillion larger and a significant chunk of its shortfall would disappear. “While policymakers cannot undo the past, they can take action to improve Social Security’s fiscal outlook by implementing policies that boost wages, combat rising inequality, and modernize the program’s revenue structure to reflect today’s economy,” the report said.

comprehensive package of protection” against the “hazards and vicissitudes of life” is tantamount to political suicide. Hillary Clinton has stated that she doesn’t want to roll back Social Security benefits in any way. In fact, she wants to expand the program. Donald Trump, meanwhile, hasn’t laid out any specific policy points on Social Security, but he has said that he opposes any cuts to benefits. Are the most popularly proposed Social Security reforms — raising the retirement age, reforming cost-of-living adjustments or expanding the withholding tax — fair to retirees and workers? If not, what should be done to make the program sustainable going forward?   Alicia H. Munnell is the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College and the Peter F. Drucker professor of management sciences at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. In the 1990s, Munnell served as assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy and as a member of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers. Even though the future of Social Security has received little attention during this campaign, the next president will have to decide how to approach the program’s problems. Absent any legislation, the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted by the mid-2030s, requiring a 25 percent cut in benefits. Sensible policymakers should make changes now in order to avoid abrupt changes later. Neither candidate has recommended cutting Social Security benefits. Indeed, several factors argue against benefit cuts. The need for retirement income is increasing because people are living longer and health-care costs are high and rising. At the same time, retirees are already receiving less from Social Security — relative to their earnings — as the retirement age gradually rises to 67; as Medicare premiums take a bigger chunk out of benefits; and as more retirees will have their benefits taxed under the personal income tax. Employer-sponsored retirement plans are also increasingly in the form of 401(k)s with very modest balances, and half the private-sector workforce does not participate in any type of employer-sponsored plan at any given time. Simply put, more and more Americans just don’t have enough for retirement. On the other hand, Social Security faces a 75-year deficit equal to 2.66 percent of workers’ covered earnings. That is, if the payroll tax rate were raised immediately by roughly 2.66 percentage points — 1.33 percentage points each for the employee and the employer — the government would be able to pay the current package of benefits for everyone who reaches retirement age at least through 2090. But raising the payroll tax, which has no deductions or exemptions, places a significant burden on low-wage workers. In addition to raising payroll tax rates, other options exist for increasing revenue to eliminate the deficit, such as broadening the payroll tax base by including the value of employer-paid health insurance premiums or increasing the cap on taxable earnings — currently $118,500 — to cover, say, 90 percent of earnings. Another alternative that merits some consideration is to move the cost burden associated with Social Security’s legacy debt — costs accumulated by paying benefits to earlier generations far in excess of their contributions. Soon after the program was set up in the 1930s, the first recipients were only required to pay taxes for a short period before becoming eligible for benefits. For example, the first recipient, a woman named Ida May Fuller, worked under Social Security for less than three years and ended up collecting benefits for 35 years. Many of the early beneficiaries had fought in World War I or had suffered losses in the Great Depression, so the decision may have been wise. But the cost of that decision was to forgo the buildup of a trust fund whose accumulated interest could have covered a substantial part of today’s benefits. The question now is whether current and future workers should be asked to pay the higher payroll tax resulting from the decision to give away the trust fund, or whether they should in essence be asked to pay simply what they would have to contribute in a fully funded system. One could argue that the legacy burden should be borne by the general population, in proportion to each taxpayer’s ability to pay under the federal personal income tax. The legacy debt must be paid one way or another, but the income tax is a more equitable mechanism than the payroll tax. With the legacy debt transferred to the income tax, our current payroll taxes would cover scheduled benefits. Read more: C.

+What should the next president do to make Social Security more sustainable? It’s become a cliche to say that Social Security is unsustainable, but it’s also the truth. The Social Security Administration projects that it will only be able to pay its beneficiaries in full until 2037. If Congress doesn’t act, benefits will be cut for millions of retirees who have already contributed to the plan. Efforts to reform the program have been launched: Rep. Reid J. Ribble (R-Wis.), for example, has taken on the unpopular task of proposing potential fixes, which include a combination of expanding taxes, upping the retirement age and reducing future benefits by pinning them to more accurate inflation measurements. The proposal has attracted some limited bipartisan support, but it’s unlikely to make headway in the House. Anything that gives the impression of trying to dismantle the much-relied-upon “	268	"[{""start"": 169, ""end"": 282, ""text"": ""The Social Security Administration projects that it will only be able to pay its beneficiaries in full until 2037"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 169, ""end"": 282, ""text"": ""The Social Security Administration projects that it will only be able to pay its beneficiaries in full until 2037"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	277	2023-03-28T08:18:44.880586Z	2023-03-28T08:18:44.880682Z	54.427
"This story has been updated. The trust fund that pays Medicare's hospital expenses will run out of money in 2029, a year later than the most recent projection, according to a federal report. The Social Security program will remain solvent until 2034, a projection unchanged from last year. The annual report from the Social Security and Medicare board of trustees provides a snapshot of the long-term solvency of the federal government's two biggest entitlement programs. It comes as Republican lawmakers have introduced a new version of a health care bill that would make deep, long-term cuts to a different entitlement program, Medicaid. Together, Medicare and Social Security comprised 42 percent of federal program spending in 2016. Medicare covered 56.8 million beneficiaries in 2016 and Social Security provided benefits for 60.9 million people. The trustees include representatives of the Treasury Department, Health and Human Services, Labor and Social Security. They noted that the growth in national health spending in the U.S. has slowed in recent years. But they said it was unclear how much of that reflected the temporary effects of the economic downturn, as opposed to systemic changes in how health care is being used and paid for that could result in savings in years to come. The slowdown in growth helped keep the Medicare program solvent for an additional year longer than the last projection and helped avoid activating the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member board that is tasked with proposing Medicare cuts if spending grows faster than a target rate. ""The trajectory is still alarming. That is why the trustees issue the warning that we do -- the same warning that has been issued for years now -- that Congress must act to ensure the long-term fiscal viability, sustainability and survival of Medicare and Social Security,"" said Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price. He said that the report is based on assumptions that reflect current law and that it does not factor in the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act. ""We haven't calculated that yet,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin added. ""But I hope that's in next year's report."" The trustees said that both Medicare and Social Security face long-term challenges. They exhorted lawmakers to act soon to implement new policies to shore up the programs, while there is still time for the public -- particularly vulnerable populations -- to prepare. The disability insurance trust fund, part of the Social Security program, was projected to last until 2028. That's five years longer than last year's projection, due to fewer-than-expected people joining the program. Applications for disability benefits have been declining since 2010. Mnuchin stressed that the key to assuring the solvency of the trusts  --and the first priority for President Trump -- was growing the economy. ""A combination of an aging population and tepid economic growth has produced the projected short-falls for both Social Security and Medicare,"" Mnuchin said, citing the importance of tax and regulatory reform in spurring economic growth that will help stabilize the programs' finances. ""Persistent and strong economic growth can help bring these programs to sustainable solvency,"" he added. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta pointed out that in 1960 there were five workers for every Social Security recipient. By 2035, there will be only two workers for every beneficiary. ""By helping more Americans enter the workforce, and then also continue to work as long as they choose, we can increase the amount of growth and possibly impact the long-term fiscal health of the trust funds,"" Acosta said. The report comes as Senate Republicans have put forth a health care bill that has been criticized for its cuts to a different entitlement program, Medicaid, the health care plan for the poor. Some health policy experts have argued those cuts could increase Medicare spending, if older adults lose health care coverage and forego care until they are 65. ""Reductions in coverage could have unanticipated spillover effects for Medicare in the form of higher premiums and cost sharing, if pre-65 adults need more services when they age on to Medicare as a result of being uninsured beforehand,"" a Kaiser Family Foundation brief said."	267	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 189, ""text"": ""tory has been updated.

"Reps. Tom Cole (R-Okla) and John Delaney (D-Md) introduced a bill Friday that would create a bipartisan commission to improve Social Security. Cole, a senior Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, is partnering with Delaney, a junior member of the House elected in 2012, to propose a 13-member Social Security Commission that would have a year to come up with a list of recommendations for improving the program. As it stands, the Social Security Administration has enough funds to pay full benefits through 2033, according to the latest trustees report. After then, the administration will only be able to pay about 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2087. The shortfalls for the Social Security Disability Insurance program are more immediate, with beneficiaries facing a benefit cut as early as 2016 if Congress fails to act. ""The nice thing about acting now is we can make very small changes and strengthen the program for 75 years,"" said Delaney in a phone interview. ""If we wait, we can still make changes but they would have to be drastic changes."" A number of lawmakers have been proposing ways to improve the Social Security program, but it's not clear how likely it is that any of these proposals will come to fruition. Two weeks ago, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) announced a broad plan to reform America's retirement system that included raising the retirement age for younger workers, scaling back the growth of benefits for wealthy seniors and eliminating the payroll tax for people who continue to work after reaching full retirement age. Delaney said he is personally in favor of increasing funding for Social Security benefits by raising the maximum taxable income and introducing a new threshold to increase payroll taxes paid by higher earners. There's some evidence that Americans would back Delaney's approach. As for Cole, he says he is in support of gradually raising the retirement age and changing the way cost of living adjustments are calculated. Any final recommendations would be created by the commission. The Social Security program has not been changed substantially since the 1980s, when a bipartisan commission led by Alan Greenspan in 1981 called for increasing the payroll tax, gradually increasing the retirement age and introducing a partial tax on benefits, among other adjustments. At least two key differences set that instance apart from the commission being proposed today: During the 1980s, concerns about the health of the Social Security program were more immediate, with some estimates saying the trust fund could be depleted by 1983, the year in which the changes were eventually approved. And that commission was created by President Reagan, not by Congress. More recently, the Simpson-Bowles commission created in 2010 also proposed three main changes to Social Security, such as raising the taxable maximum on income to 90 percent of all income, slowing the cost-of-living adjustments and raising the retirement age. But that proposal ultimately did not muster enough votes in Congress. Under the bill introduced Friday, the commission would have a year to create a list of recommendations for making the Social Security trust fund solvent for 75 years. Twelve members of the committee would be appointed by leadership from both parties in the House and Senate (two of the appointees must be non-elected experts); the 13th appointee would be named by President Obama. Recommendations would then need to be put up for a vote before the House and the Senate. “At the end of the day most Americans believe in Social Security and most Americans want to make it work and are willing to make a sacrifice in order to make it happen,” said Cole. “This is at least an effort to get the discussion going.”"	266	"[{""start"": 424, ""end"": 674, ""text"": ""As it stands, the Social Security Administration has enough funds to pay full benefits through 2033, according to the latest trustees report.

  Today is Social Security’s 80th birthday, and in its honor, let’s take a moment to honor a system that is both an essential component of retirement security and a real testament to the importance of the role of government. I realize we live in an age where that role is disparaged daily, in many cases by the very people who are paid by the rest of us to do a better job of running the government. And yet, even while gridlock and dysfunction persist, Social Security keeps on trucking along, providing a progressive, fully vested, universal, guaranteed pension to nearly all elderly Americans. And it does so highly efficiently, with administrative costs that amount to less than 1 percent of annual benefits, “far below the percentages for private retirement annuities.” So, raise a glass (of Metamucil?) in her honor, and consider these points: While she’s a healthy 80, Social Security does face a long-run solvency gap. After 2034, according to the latest estimates, the program would be able to pay 75 percent of scheduled benefits. That’s not zero, as is often misrepresented by fear mongers, but it’s a serious shortfall that must be avoided. (The Social Security Disability Insurance trust fund is projected to face a shortfall much sooner, in 2016; but while this has led to alarmist critiques, a simple reallocation between the DI and old-age trust funds, a noncontroversial step that Congress has undertaken many times in the past, would enable both funds to pay full benefits through 2034.) Broadly speaking, there are only three ways to close the solvency gap, which, looking out 75 years, amounts to less than 3 percent of taxable payroll: we can raise taxes, cut benefits, or do both. In considering our menu of options, we should remember that, as jumps out from the figure above, Social Security is an essential income component for low- and middle-income elderly families. These families cannot sustain any cuts to their benefits. Some ideas: Raise the maximum amount of wages subject to the payroll tax. Due to increased earnings inequality (an increased share of earnings going to the highest earners), this tax now hits only about 83 percent of covered earnings, well less than the 90 percent it applied to in decades past. Gradually apply the payroll tax to employer-provided health care benefits. A few years ago, Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin made the case—pretty convincingly, I thought—that the growth of employer-sponsored fringe benefits has fueled cost pressures in the health-care system and eroded the Social Security tax base, as a rising share of workers’ total compensation has come in the form of untaxed benefits rather than taxed wages. Their application of this idea closed around a third of the 75-year gap. Broaden the tax base by subjecting voluntary salary-reduction plans, such as cafeteria plans and health care Flexible Spending Accounts, to the payroll tax (as 401(k) plans and similar retirement accounts already are). Increase the payroll tax. As my colleague Kathy Ruffing has written, “Future workers are expected to be more prosperous than today’s.  Under the trustees’ assumptions, the average worker will be almost 50 percent better off — in real terms — in 2040 than in 2014, and twice as well off by 2070.  It is appropriate to devote a small portion of those gains to the payroll tax, while still leaving future workers with much higher take-home pay.  Social Security is a popular program, and poll respondents of all ages and incomes express a willingness to support it through higher taxes.” Reduce benefits for wealthy recipients. But don’t expect to close much of the gap this way. As the figure implies, most of the benefits go to low and middle income households. Only 2 percent of Social Security benefits go to retirees with non-Social Security income of $100,000 or more each year, and only about 10 percent goes to people with income above $40,000. To fix Social Security this way, you’d have to break it. Years ago, in a book called “All Together Now: Common Sense for a Fair Economy,” I wrote the following: “Social Security creates a strong link between the aged and the working-age population. The idea behind the program is that today’s workers create the capital, the technology, and the wealth that will support tomorrow’s generation. Embedded in its formulas is the notion that those of us who came before, whether they were teachers, accountants, homemakers, mail carriers, barbers, cashiers, or lawyers, have built up the productive capacity of our nation. When the children of these workers come of age (along with new immigrants), they will earn their living from this infrastructure while also making their own contributions. As they do so, we will peel off some portion of their earnings to provide pensions for their forebears, just as those forebears did for their own predecessors. If this were a Disney movie, music about the “Circle of Life” would swell up here, but suffice it to say, Social Security is an elegant collaborative solution to a universal challenge.” For sure, none of those fixes are easy, and today’s politics seems quite removed from common sense and fairness. But ask yourself why this 80-year old program is so popular. I suspect it’s because behind the noise that passes for political debate, people recognize Social Security for what it is: an elegant, efficient, collaborative solution to a universal challenge.	265	"[{""start"": 876, ""end"": 925, ""text"": ""Social Security does face a long-run solvency gap"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 927, ""end"": 1151, ""text"": ""After 2034, according to the latest estimates, the program would be able to pay 75 percent of scheduled benefits.

"“The share of publicly held debt we have now relative to GDP has only happened once before in U.S. history. What our debt levels are — we often talk about this number, $19 trillion of debt. That’s not the real number because all of your entitlement spending is kept off book on a different ledger. The real number is more like 70 to 75 trillion dollars — and so when you set that up against U.S. GDP, the only time we ever had a debt-to-GDP ratio like this was on the eve of the Great Depression.” — Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), town hall meeting in Elkhorn, Neb., March 17, 2017 We’ve been asking readers to send us fishy-sounding claims from town halls being held by lawmakers. A reader questioned the assertion made by Sen. Ben Sasse that the national debt is really more like $70 trillion to $75 trillion, rather than the more commonly used figure of $19 trillion. Here’s the key moment in the discussion, which you can see was somewhat rowdy, though Sasse handled himself well. He was attempting to answer a question about proposed cuts in arts funding. Let’s dig into this. In addition to Sasse’s comments on the “real number” being $70 trillion to $75 trillion, we’ll look into his remarks on the debt-to-GDP ratio. The Facts The Treasury Department has a website that provides the national debt up to the penny. It lists three figures — debt held by the public (about $14.35 trillion on April 13, 2017), intragovernmental holdings ($5.49 trillion) and total public debt outstanding ($19.85 trillion). Intragovernmental holdings include items such as the Social Security Trust Funds, which hold U.S. Treasury securities that can be redeemed at some point to pay benefits. (For more, see our guide to understanding Social Security.) The Social Security and Medicare trust funds accumulated these bonds because the government at the time collected more money than it needed to pay Social Security benefits and so borrowed the money to pay other bills. Thus intragovernmental holdings are debt that taxpayers owe to future taxpayers. Generally, economists and bond traders pay much more attention to the public debt number. “Gross debt is not a good indicator of the government’s fiscal condition,” the Congressional Budget Office says. “The value of Treasury securities held by trust funds and other government accounts measures only some of the commitments the government has made for the future, and it includes some amounts that may not represent future obligations at all.” In other words, public-traded debt amounts to a little over $14 trillion. So how does Sasse get to $70 trillion to $75 trillion? That’s a number that adds in implicit liabilities that are not easily captured in official reports about the public debt. It also looks over a very long time period — 75 years. James Wegmann, a spokesman for Sasse, said he was drawing on several sources to come up with a ballpark figure. The Treasury Department, in a 2016 report, said that the projected expenditures for scheduled benefits for social insurance programs would exceed projected revenue by $46.7 trillion. Adding to it the gross debt of $19 trillion yields a figure of $66 trillion. Over an infinite horizon, Treasury said, total resources for Social Security and Medicare amounted to $90.5 trillion in present value terms. Wegmann said Sasse was taking a number between those values to make a broader point. “At the town hall, Sasse was seeking to drive home the point that unfunded obligations, not arts funding, are driving the debt without wading into a debate on scoring windows,” Wegmann said. “His 70 to 75 trillion-dollar number ballparks the two scores.” Now it’s important to remember that these large numbers should be measured against equally large numbers regarding revenue and national resources. Treasury said that the $46.7 trillion figure represented about 3.8 percent of the present value of GDP over 75 years, which helps put the number in perspective. The present value of GDP over an infinite horizon is $1.3 quadrillion. In 2014, James D. Hamilton, an economist at the University of California at San Diego, published an article that calculated that as of 2012, the U.S. government had about $70 trillion in off-balance-sheet commitments and public debt. Social Security and Medicare accounted for about 77 percent of that figure, but it also includes housing-related commitments, student loans, federal deposit insurance and other government trust funds. Some of these obligations, such as FDIC guarantees, do not pose significant risks to taxpayers, Hamilton said. “Other programs, such as the federal government’s big role in lending for housing and education, have less clear benefits and have been associated with more tangible costs,” he said. “The biggest off-balance-sheet liabilities come from recognition of the fiscal stress that will come in the form of an aging population and rising medical expenditures.” Hamilton noted that at times, such as during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, off-balance-sheet obligations ended up costing Americans real money. The United States had to honor $124 billion in off-balance-sheet commitments when the savings and loan industry collapsed. The situation has been even more dramatic in other countries. Ireland had a very strong financial position, on paper, before the Great Recession. But the Irish then had to inject the equivalent of 45 percent of their GDP to rescue the banking system, sending the country’s debt from 25 percent of GDP to over 100 percent. So Sasse is correct to highlight implicit liabilities that are larger than the official debt. He gets into a bit of trouble by suggesting $70 trillion is “the real number,” as these figures do not represent actual debt instruments. These are potential obligations, but as Sasse well knows, Congress is able to change future Social Security and Medicare benefits, as it has in the past. Indeed, Sasse himself has proposed to gradually index the age of eligibility and means-testing benefits, which would reduce future obligations. Finally, Sasse referred to the GDP-to-debt ratio. When we first watched the video, we thought he was referring to the GDP-to-debt ratio under the $70 trillion figure, which would be Pinocchio-worthy because it is rather misleading to compare liabilities over the infinite future to one year of GDP. But Wegmann said that Sasse’s reference to $70 trillion to $75 trillion was parenthetical. “Sasse starts with a conversation of debt to GDP, interrupts to make a point about the off-books debt we’ve discussed, and then comes back to debt to GDP,” he said, noting that Sasse misspoke when he made a reference to the highest level being on the eve of the Great Depression. “He probably should have said World War II.” The gross debt-to-GDP ratio did peak right after World War II, to nearly 120 percent, and then declined steadily to about 30 percent until the Ronald Reagan administration. The debt ratio soared until a brief period of balanced budgets under Bill Clinton. Then the Great Recession sent the debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketing. As the charts below show, the ratio more or less has plateaued around 100 percent in the last few years of the Obama administration but still has not been reduced from its post-recession high — unlike the period immediately following World War II. The first chart goes back more than a century, showing from 1900 to 2015. The second chart shows more detailed quarterly movements from 1966 to 2016. The ratio would be lower — but still relatively high — if you only counted public-traded debt, not intragovernmental holdings. The Pinocchio Test Sasse was speaking off the cuff in a noisy public forum, so we can understand it might have been difficult to get this exactly right. The senator was correct to note that arts funding is not a major factor in the debt, compared to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which have long-term obligations that could total $70 trillion to $75 trillion. But he was a bit misleading when he called those obligations “the real number,” when in fact those obligations can be reduced if Congress takes action. So it’s not really the same as the Treasury securities now traded on Wall Street, or even the bonds in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Sasse should have spoken more clearly and explained he was talking about anticipated costs over a 75-year or infinite period, not debt held by bondholders. That would have allowed him to speak more clearly about the unusually high debt-to-GDP ratio for the United States. It’s an important point to raise, and will be solved either by a booming economy or tough choices about reducing federal spending or boosting federal revenue.

Falling health-care costs are brightening the financial outlook for Medicare, extending the life of the trust fund that supports the program until 2026 — two years later than previously forecast. The new projections, released Friday by the program’s trustees, credit President Obama’s Affordable Care Act in part for the improvement in the finances of the federal health insurance program for the elderly. The act’s limits on Medicare Advantage, a more expensive form of Medicare run by private insurers, are proving more effective than previously forecast, the report said. The trustees also cited lower-than-expected spending in “most . . . service categories — especially skilled nursing facilities,” a development that is not well understood. Costs have been slowing throughout the health-care industry, partly because of the recent recession, economists say, but also because of what appear to be more fundamental changes aimed at reducing waste and improving health outcomes. The trustees reported no such gains in the finances of Social Security, but no significant deterioration, either. The Social Security trust funds will have enough cash to pay full retirement and disability benefits until 2033, the report said. Both programs still face huge long-term financial problems as the baby-boom generation retires. And on Friday, analysts worried that the sunnier projections, together with an improving economy and a rapidly shrinking federal budget deficit, could serve to further dampen enthusiasm in Washington for tackling the nation’s toughest fiscal problems. “To me, that’s the real loss of all this good news,” said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Washington-based Center for Studying Health System Change. “I don’t think anyone except the most extreme person, seeing these trends, thinks the [Medicare] cost problem has been solved. But the way politicians are, it does tend to take the pressure off.” At a news conference at the Treasury Department to release the report, top administration officials pledged to do more to control costs even as they hailed the early success of the president’s signature health-care initiative. The Affordable Care Act has come under sustained attack since its passage in 2010 from Republicans who accused Obama of raiding Medicare to help pay for an expansion of health coverage for the uninsured. The Affordable Care Act indeed aimed to slice roughly $700 billion in savings from Medicare over a decade, mainly through cost controls for providers. The result since its passage, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters, has been to extend the life of the trust fund that pays hospital bills by nearly a decade. “Today’s trustee report confirms that the ACA is continuing to strengthen Medicare and ensure its solvency for future generations,” Sebelius said, noting that the administration had advanced that goal “without eliminating a single guaranteed benefit.” With Medicare spending per person now rising at the historically low rate of 1.7 percent a year, Sebelius said, seniors can also expect to profit: Preliminary estimates show Medicare premiums for 2014 will not rise “a single dime.” Sebelius is one of four administration officials who serve on the board of trustees for Medicare and Social Security. There are also two public trustees: Charles Blahous, a research fellow at the Hoover Institute, and Robert D. Reischauer, a former president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. At the news conference, Reischauer cautioned that it “would be a mistake” to interpret the two-year improvement in the life of the Medicare trust fund “as a significant development.” He noted that the future of Medicare “depends critically on our ability to adhere to the [spending] discipline in the ACA” — a prospect that has long generated skepticism. Even if the act holds up, independent analysts say policymakers will have to do more to shore up Medicare and Social Security at a time when 10,000 people are retiring daily. “The good news doesn’t mitigate the long-term challenges with the growing elderly population,” said Patricia Neuman, director of the Program on Medicare Policy at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Reischauer and Blahous also warned against complacency for Social Security. While the trust fund for retirement benefits will be solvent for decades, a separate fund for disability benefits will run out in 2016 without congressional action. Making both programs fully solvent for 75 years would require an immediate increase in the 12.4 percent payroll tax of 2.7 percentage points, or an immediate cut in benefits — for all beneficiaries — of more than 16 percent. “Even if a Social Security solution were enacted today and effective immediately, it would require financial corrections that are substantially more severe than those enacted” in the last major reforms to Social Security in 1983, they wrote in a message included in the report. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Obama “recognizes how essential reform is” and “is determined to work on a bipartisan basis to put Social Security and Medicare on a stronger footing.” In his most recent budget request, Obama proposed using a less-generous measure of inflation to calculate annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security, an idea that would fix about a quarter of the program’s long-term funding shortfall. Obama has also proposed to cut Medicare spending by reducing “excessive subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask[ing] wealthy seniors to contribute a little more,” as Lew put it. But those proposals have gone nowhere in Congress, where members of both parties have shied away from reforms that would affect current beneficiaries. There is some hope that the need to raise the federal debt limit later this year will create fresh pressure for a deal. But for now, Lew acknowledged Friday, momentum has waned. “Our challenge is going to be the path to have this conversation in a bipartisan way,” Lew said. “I remain hopeful that we will do that. Doing it sooner rather than later gives us more choices.”	263	"[{""start"": 747, ""end"": 980, ""text"": ""Costs have been slowing throughout the health-care industry, partly because of the recent recession, economists say, but also because of what appear to be more fundamental changes aimed at reducing waste and improving health outcomes"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1226, ""end"": 1321, ""text"": ""Both programs still face huge long-term financial problems as the baby-boom generation retires."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1322, ""end"": 1572, ""text"": ""d on Friday, analysts worried that the sunnier projections, together with an improving economy and a rapidly shrinking federal budget deficit, could serve to further dampen enthusiasm in Washington for tackling the nation’s toughest fiscal problem"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2269, ""end"": 2352, ""text"": ""raiding Medicare to help pay for an expansion of health coverage for the uninsured."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3702, ""end"": 3872, ""text"": ""He noted that the future of Medicare “depends critically on our ability to adhere to the [spending] discipline in the ACA” — a prospect that has long generated skepticism"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4015, ""end"": 4047, ""text"": ""10,000 people are retiring dail"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3702, ""end"": 3872, ""text"": ""e noted that the future of Medicare “depends critically on our ability to adhere to the [spending] discipline in the ACA” — a prospect that has long generated skepticism"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1322, ""end"": 1572, ""text"": ""nd on Friday, analysts worried that the sunnier projections, together with an improving economy and a rapidly shrinking federal budget deficit, could serve to further dampen enthusiasm in Washington for tackling the nation’s toughest fiscal problems"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	272	2023-03-28T07:45:58.704814Z	2023-03-28T07:45:58.704882Z	506.954
"The fastest-growing part of the federal budget -- spending on health-care programs -- has slowed sharply in recent years. And while no one knows quite why that's happening, the Congressional Budget Office is predicting substantial savings. For the 10-year period beginning in 2010, the estimated cost of Medicare and Medicaid -- the government health programs for the elderly and the poor -- has dropped by $1.23 trillion, according to revised CBO projections. In its latest look at the nation's long-term finances, released Tuesday, CBO predicts that the savings will grow by 2039  to 1.5 percent of the economy -- or, in today's dollars, roughly $250 billion a year. That's real money by any measure. But it's not enough to brighten the CBO's otherwise gloomy forecast for the next 25 years. While annual deficits are ""shrinking noticeably,"" the CBO said, ""the long-term budget outlook is much less positive,"" with the portion of the national debt held by public investors forecast to climb from 74 percent of the economy today to 106 percent in 2039. Outside World War II, the nation has never carried such a heavy debt load. Spending on health care remains the biggest driver, due primarily to huge numbers of being added to government health-care rolls. This year, the CBO projects that the federal government will spend nearly $1 trillion -- almost a third of the entire $3.5 trillion federal budget -- on Medicare, Medicaid and insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. That's more than the government will spend in any other category, including Social Security and national defense. And by 2039, the cost of health-care programs will rise sharply, growing from about 4.8 percent of GDP today to about 8 percent of GDP in 2039. In the short term, the Affordable Care Act is a major factor in rising costs, the CBO said. In 2024, roughly 62 percent of the projected growth in health-care spending will be due to President Obama's initiative to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. By 2039, however, the aging of the population will be the most important factor."	262	"[{""start"": 1836, ""end"": 1992, ""text"": ""In 2024, roughly 62 percent of the projected growth in health-care spending will be due to President Obama's initiative to reduce the ranks of the uninsured"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 794, ""end"": 843, ""text"": ""While annual deficits are \""shrinking noticeably,\"""", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 912, ""end"": 1052, ""text"": ""with the portion of the national debt held by public investors forecast to climb from 74 percent of the economy today to 106 percent in 2039"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 912, ""end"": 1053, ""text"": ""with the portion of the national debt held by public investors forecast to climb from 74 percent of the economy today to 106 percent in 2039."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1836, ""end"": 1993, ""text"": ""n 2024, roughly 62 percent of the projected growth in health-care spending will be due to President Obama's initiative to reduce the ranks of the uninsured."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2003, ""end"": 2074, ""text"": ""however, the aging of the population will be the most important factor."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	271	2023-03-28T07:31:40.327012Z	2023-03-28T07:37:30.303862Z	223.697
Medicare’s financial stability has been strengthened by the Affordable Care Act and other forces that have been subduing health-care spending, according to a new official forecast that says the fund covering the program’s hospital costs will remain solvent until 2030 — four years later than expected a year ago. The annual report, issued Monday by trustees overseeing the government’s two largest entitlement programs, found little change overall in the finances of Social Security. The trustees warned, however, that the part of Social Security that pays monthly benefits to people with disabilities is especially fragile and, without changes, will start to run short of money for benefit checks in 2016. Taken together, the findings provide a nuanced portrait of the fiscal future of these two programs, which act as cornerstones of social insurance — and a buffer against poverty — for older people and other vulnerable Americans. The trustees welcomed the improved financial prospects for Medicare but acknowledged that the underlying reasons are not yet entirely understood. At the same time, they exhorted Congress to take steps to prevent both programs from collapsing in the long term. “Neither Medicare nor Social Security can sustain projected long-run program costs,” the trustees said in a message accompanying their reports. For the past few decades, Democrats and Republicans have fretted about the unsustainability of the Medicare and Social Security programs. They have appointed high-level commissions, proposed legislation and tried to stoke public fears that benefits might not be available for their parents — or themselves. But Congress has not restructured either program to withstand long-term fiscal pressures, and the issue has been absent lately from the agendas of both parties. At a news briefing Monday, Cabinet secretaries and two public trustees reiterated the call for Congress to act. “[We] must make manageable changes now, so we do not have to make drastic changes later,” Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said. “It is getting very late in the game” to find a bipartisan consensus, said the trustees’ only Republican, Charles P. Blahous III, who worked on Social Security and other economic issues as an aide to President George W. Bush. “A solution much further delayed is a solution much less likely to occur.” Both programs are being strained by the nation’s demographics. As more baby boomers reach retirement age, people 65 and older are making up an increasing percentage of the country’s population, with proportionally fewer working-age Americans chipping in payroll taxes. Medicare’s finances are facing other pressures, too, including from scientific advances that lead to new treatment and therapies, the report said. The trustees’ forecast said that the trust fund that pays for hospital care — Medicare Part A — has been strengthened significantly, with the date when it is predicted to start running short of money extended by 14 years since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. The report also predicted that the insurance premiums that older Americans pay for the portion of Medicare that covers doctors’ visits and other outpatient care would probably remain the same for a third year in a row. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that it is impossible so far to gauge how much of that trust fund’s improved fiscal health was due to the health-care law as opposed to other changes in the health-care system that are slowing cost increases. She said both had a role. The ACA, for instance, is slowing payments to Medicare Advantage, the part of the program in which older Americans join private health plans, while other provisions focus on curbing hospital readmissions. The report said that spending on hospital stays last year was less than expected, although trustees noted that analysts have not determined whether this trend reflected broad economic trends or stemmed from specific changes in the practice of medical care. If Medicare is unchanged by 2030, the year it is projected to become insolvent, it would then be able to pay 85 percent of its beneficiaries’ hospital bills, a proportion that would slip to 75 percent by 2047, the forecast said. For Social Security, the trustees predicted that the program’s two separate trust funds will, combined, have enough money to pay all the retirement and disability benefits it owes until 2033, the same time horizon as in the last two annual forecasts. They forecast that Social Security will be able to afford checks for retirees and workers’ survivors until 2034 — nearly two decades longer than the part of the program that pays disability benefits. Social Security’s expenditures last year exceeded its income from payroll taxes, as it has each year since 2010, the report says, although interest so far is making up the difference. This year, President Obama backed away from an idea he broached in his budget last year to save money for Social Security by changing the basis on which inflation is calculated for the program. But his 2015 budget proposal reprises the idea of charging more for care under Medicare to older Americans who are relatively well-off — an idea that Congress has not touched this year. In calculating Medicare’s future finances, the trustees for the first time acknowledged that Congress has each year overridden scheduled reductions in Medicare doctors’ fees — cuts that, if adopted, would lower payments for doctors’ services by 21 percent in 2015. In the latest report, the trustees assumed that such cuts would continue to be waived. The trustees noted that their new forecast was released 49 years to the week that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the law that enacted Medicare, a major component of the Great Society programs of the mid-1960s. Social Security was a response to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Last year, Medicare insured 52 million Americans, including 43.5 million age 65 and older and nearly 9 million younger people with disabilities. Social Security last year provided benefits to 41 million retired workers and their families, 6 million survivors of workers who died, and 11 million working-age people with disabilities.

This post has been updated Tens of millions of seniors will see no annual cost-of-living adjustment in their Social Security checks in 2016, the government said Thursday, unwelcome news that also will flatten benefit payments for retired federal workers and service members. It is only the third time in 40 years — all of them during the Obama administration — that the Social Security Administration has not increased its payments. The raises are tied to the consumer price index (CPI). About 65 million retired and disabled workers, spouses and children collect Social Security benefits every month, the equivalent of about 1 in 4 households. Another 15 million are disabled veterans, federal retirees and their survivors, and those on Supplemental Security Income, the disability program for the poor. The raises are tied to the consumer price index (CPI), which has been flat because of lower gasoline prices. [The retirement costs that are rising faster than Social Security benefits] The lack of a raise triggers other bad news for retirees: Higher medical costs. Most Americans have their outpatient care premiums for Medicare Part B deducted directly from their Social Security checks, and the annual cost-of-living increase usually covers any increase to premiums. When it doesn’t, a longstanding “hold harmless” law protects about 70 percent of seniors from having their Social Security payments reduced. But that leaves about 30 percent of Americans on Medicare to cover a hike to premiums that otherwise would be spread across everyone. That group includes people new to Medicare, federal retirees who don’t receive Social Security payments and about 3.1 million people with higher incomes, that is, those making more than $85,000. Their premiums could rise by 52 percent, by about $54 a month to $159, according to calculations earlier this year by the Medicare Trustees, and more for those with higher incomes. [Many federal retirees face higher Medicare premiums] White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday that the administration “is aware of this, frankly, unintended policy consequence resulting from the formula for calculating cost of living adjustments. And so we’re aware of this problem and it is something that we’re concerned about.” Earnest said the White House has had “discussions” with members of Congress about the issue “and our interest in trying to resolve it” but declined to elaborate. The Consumer Price Index is based on the Labor Department’s assessment of inflation, which is being held in check by increasing gasoline production and lower prices at the pump. Labor officials said Thursday that CPI for all items fell 0.2 percent in September after a decline of 0.1 percent in August. While medical costs are increasing, consumer prices for a range of goods from food to housing have not risen enough overall to produce an increase in benefits, and have dropped from a year ago, say economists, who have predicted for months that there would be no cost-of-living increase.   [Federal retirees got 1.7 percent cost of living adjustment in 2015]   Shortly after the Social Security announcement, Medicare announced the start of open enrollment for seniors who want to change their coverage or sign up for benefits. But the government did not give details on next year’s premiums, which also take effect in January. Close to 70 groups representing seniors and federal retirees groups have been lobbying Congress for months to pass legislation to stop the increase in premiums for everyone. Democrats in Congress have introduced bills to freeze the Part B premium and deductible for 2016, but their chances of passage are uncertain. “This is about more than just money,” Richard Thissen, president of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, said in a statement. “It is about basic fairness. There is no reason why two people with the same income should pay different Medicare premiums based on whether the money is coming from a Social Security check or a checking account.” Medicare premiums would jump disproportionately for retired federal workers who are covered by the old Civil Service Retirement System and who do not receive Social Security benefits, among millions of others. According to the latest government data, as of a year ago there were 1,461,000 federal retirees drawing benefits from the older system. Some of them do qualify for Social Security benefits through other employment, and a small percentage fall under a hybrid that includes Social Security. Groups representing retired federal employees estimate that more than 800,000 retirees in this system would have to pay the higher premiums. There are another 568,000 federal retirees under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System, which includes Social Security. The lack of an inflation adjustment also likely means there will be no change for 2016 in the investment maximums in employer-sponsored retirement savings plan such as 401(k)s and the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. Currently the general limit is $18,000, with another $6,000 “catch-up” investment allowed for investors in the year they turn age 50 and after. Also likely to be unchanged are limits on individual retirement account investments, currently $5,500, with an extra $1,000 “catch-up” allowed. The Internal Revenue Service typically makes an announcement about those limits shorter after the cost of living determination. By law, the cost-of-living adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a wide-ranging assessment of consumer prices by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Food, housing, clothing, transportation, energy, medical care, recreation, education — these all go into the calculation. If prices rise, benefits rise. If they stay more or less flat, so do benefits. Groups that advocate for retirees have long complained that CPI is a poor measure for Social Security benefits. People who are working have different spending patterns than retirees, they argue, driving more and spending less on health care and long-term care than those who have stopped working. But medical care is where prices are rising faster than other goods. Advocates favor using what’s called the CPI-E (E for elderly), which attempts to take into account the different spending patters for retirees. “The government needs a new approach – one that recognizes the reality of rising costs in many areas, especially health care, that are putting pressure on American seniors,” Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.   He has introduced a bill that would amend current law by requiring the use of the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly rather than the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, when calculating annual cost of living adjustments for people on Social Security. “It is absolutely outrageous and disgraceful that our seniors are suffering because we continue to use an antiquated formula to determine cost of living increases,” said, who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. Only twice before, in 2010 and 2011 since cost-of-living adjustments started, has there been no bump up in benefits. Retirees did receive a 1.7 percent cost-of-living increase for 2015, a 1.5 percent boost for 2014, a 1.7 percent increase for 2013 and a 3.6 percent bump for 2012. Congress enacted automatic increases for Social Security beneficiaries in 1975, when inflation was high and there was a lot of pressure to regularly raise benefits. Since then, increases have averaged 4 percent a year.

There’s no denying that Social Security is confusing. But many people — including those close to retirement age — struggle to grasp even the basics. Only 28 percent of people passed a 10-question true or false quiz on Social Security benefits, according to a study by MassMutual Life Insurance Company. Just one person out of the more than 1,500 who took the test answered all 10 questions correctly. (A passing score was answering eight out of the 10 questions correctly.) The report shows that people are not only confused about when they should start collecting Social Security to get the most out their benefits, they may not fully understand what they’re entitled to or how other decisions may affect their benefits and taxes. Here are some of the most fundamental things many people got wrong. The official retirement age is not 65. More than 70 percent of people surveyed said they thought the full retirement age was 65. That used to be the case, but now a person’s full retirement age, or the age at which they can start collecting full retirement benefits, varies depending on the year they were born. The full retirement age is 66 for people born between 1943 and 1954 and it gradually increases to 67 for people born in 1960 or later. Getting the official retirement age right is important because people who collect benefits early get reduced monthly checks and those who wait beyond their retirement age to collect can receive 8 percent more for every year that they delay. (Check this table from the Social Security Administration to look up your full retirement age.) Working can reduce your benefits. Most people, about 55 percent, thought it was fine to keep working while receiving retirement benefits, regardless of age. But they overlooked that people who haven’t reached their full retirement age yet could see Social Security benefits reduced if they earn above a certain amount. For instance, people born between 1943 and Jan. 1, 1955 will have $1 deducted from their benefits for every $2 they earn above $15,720 if they’re younger than their full retirement age. The money isn’t lost forever. It gets added on later after they reach their full retirement age. (People who work past their full retirement age can keep all of their benefits, no matter how much they make.) You can collect retirement benefits from an ex. Only 45 percent of people knew that they could collect Social Security spousal benefits after getting divorced. This is generally true if the two people were married for at least 10 years and the person looking to collect their former spouse’s benefits has not re-married.
