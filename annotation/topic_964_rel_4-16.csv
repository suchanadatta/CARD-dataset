A total of 30 cases of adenovirus have been confirmed at the University of Maryland, and university officials announced plans to intensify its dormitory cleaning program to help prevent additional infections. An announcement made last week by the university’s department of resident life gave the updated adenovirus infection numbers. Of the 30 confirmed cases, eight of the students have been hospitalized. It said four cases have been confirmed of adenovirus 7, a particularly virulent strain of the virus. One Maryland student has died of what were reported to be adenovirus-related causes. In announcing the disinfecting program, the resident life department said it would go beyond normal winter-break practices, and extend inside rooms to surfaces that are frequently touched inside rooms. Such surfaces include doorknobs, furniture tops, light switches, faucets and bedframes, the department said. The program is to be conducted from January 7 to January 18, the department said. According to the announcement, the aim is to support UMd’s broader effort to prevent the spread of a variety of viruses, “including adenovirus.” The university’s health center said adenoviruses can cause typical cold and flu symptoms. But the center emphasized that it is particularly important that these symptoms not be ignored by those with lowered immune systems. Such persons should see a physician within 48 hours of developing symptoms, the health center said.

The virus arrived with little warning. It would pop up in a dormitory. Then it would beset students living off campus. As University of Maryland students embark on their winter break, disease trackers have found no obvious ties among the people who fell ill from adenovirus during the fall semester. University officials said 40 students have tested positive, including one who died of an illness associated with the disease. “There hasn’t been much in the way of commonalities that we’ve been able to detect,” University Health Center director David McBride said. “We’ve looked at where the students who are sick live, what organizations they’re in, whether their roommates are sick. There really is not a consistent pattern coming through.” Now, they are scouring dorms, offering health warnings and providing online updates. Adenovirus can cause the common cold, but it can also be the source of serious illness, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The university monitored the outbreak with the state Department of Health and the Prince George’s County Health Department. And as officials have worked to combat the outbreak, specimens have been sent to the CDC for testing. Ten of those specimens have been confirmed as an adenovirus strain that can lead to more significant health problems, a university website says. “Anytime there are students who are sick on campus, it’s concerning to us and it’s concerning to the kids who get sick,” McBride said. “The students that I’ve seen, some are pretty aware of what’s going on, and some are completely unaware that we’re having something going on on campus. It’s kind of a mixed bag.” To avoid infection, the CDC recommends handwashing and avoiding contact with those who are sick. Adenovirus-related illnesses are usually treated with rest, fluids and medicine to reduce a fever, the university has said. “Clinically, this looks like the flu,” McBride said. “People have high fevers, they have [a] cough and sore throat. So in many ways, clinically, it’s not distinguishable from the seasonal influenza that we see every year.” As the virus spread in College Park, U-Md. officials notified fraternities and sororities so they could take protective measures during social events. They also contacted students with conditions that might put them at higher risk, such as those with asthma or diabetes. Among the students who have stopped by the student health center for adenovirus testing: Jonathan Allen, student body president. He was feeling poorly, so decided to be tested for the virus. His came back negative. “It’s better to be safe than sorry,” he said. “Get checked up and take a virus test, if need be.” During winter break, crews will work to clean residence hall rooms, wiping down bed frames, light switches and doorknobs, McBride said, a precaution that doesn’t normally happen during the gap in the academic calendar. Earlier in the first semester, U-Md. dealt with concerns regarding mold in a campus residence hall, which became so severe students had to temporarily relocate to hotels. The student who died of an adenovirus-associated illness, 18-year-old Olivia Paregol, lived in Elkton Hall, the dorm affected by mold, prompting questions about whether the virus and the mold might be related. But the CDC said no link exists between mold and adenovirus, and McBride also dismissed those concerns. “We’re seeing cases in residence halls across campus, and both on and off campus, and there’s definitely not a consistent connection between students who are living in Elkton and those who we’ve detected to have adenovirus,” McBride said. McBride said he has spoken with a lot of parents and understands their concerns — one student has died, and others have been admitted to the hospital. So he tries to reassure parents that most healthy people who get adenovirus or another seasonal virus might feel sick but probably won’t suffer complications. He encourages those who fall ill to check in with their doctor. “There’s nothing unique to our campus that has created this outbreak. It could have easily happened on any college campus,” he said. “I don’t think that people need to be afraid to come back to our campus specifically, as long at they’re following that advice that we’re giving, to keep everyone healthy this season.” Read More: University of Maryland’s accreditation under review in wake of football death Two senior lawmakers urge Loh to stay as U-Md. president A Maryland soccer player’s field work: Preventing goals and saving frogs	880	"[{""start"": 300, ""end"": 425, ""text"": ""University officials said 40 students have tested positive, including one who died of an illness associated with the disease."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1208, ""end"": 1352, ""text"": ""Ten of those specimens have been confirmed as an adenovirus strain that can lead to more significant health problems, a university website says."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2914, ""end"": 3293, ""text"": ""Earlier in the first semester, U-Md. dealt with concerns regarding mold in a campus residence hall, which became so severe students had to temporarily relocate to hotels.

Nearly a year after an adenovirus outbreak killed a freshman at the University of Maryland, an outside review found the college followed protocols in how it responded to the crisis but made numerous recommendations for handling campuswide emergencies. Olivia Paregol, an 18-year-old freshman, died of adenovirus on Nov. 18, 2018, after suffering from health problems during the several months she lived in a mold-infested dorm. A Washington Post report in May revealed that university officials waited 18 days to tell students about the presence of adenovirus that eventually sickened about 45 students. The 141-page report concluded the university’s response to the adenovirus and mold outbreaks at the College Park campus “should have been viewed and handled as campus-wide emergencies . . . which would have provided earlier opportunities for escalation and more effective emergency management for both incidents.” In the wake of the outbreaks, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) requested an investigation, and the University System of Maryland Board of Regents picked six individuals with “subject matter expertise” to conduct a review. The panel said it examined thousands of documents and interviewed university employees, contractors that worked for the college and Paregol’s father. The report concluded that the university “adhered to the requirements of all local, state and federal regulations and statutes governing reporting and communication concerning infectious diseases” and “the response to adenovirus was in accordance with the University’s own internal policies and procedures.” But the report identified “areas of weakness” and included 14 pages of recommendations. Those included more frequent monitoring of disease trends on campus, sharing health information with regional providers, designating an individual responsible for crisis communications and conducting air sampling after mold remediation. “Our campus works tirelessly on behalf of the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, and we will carefully consider the report’s recommendations,” university President Wallace D. Loh wrote in a campuswide email Wednesday in response to the report. “The panel unanimously found that university employees prioritized student health and safety above all else. At the same time, our work on campus safety is always ongoing.” Ian Paregol, Olivia’s father, said he appreciated the panel’s efforts but thought the Oct. 22 interview conducted with him was an “afterthought” because he was the last one scheduled and was asked only three questions. “We do not want another child and family to suffer through this unimaginable pain, and if pushing for an investigation to evaluate the university’s responses can prevent that from happening and avoids another unnecessary death, then at least we have made some progress in accountability within the UMD system,” Paregol said. Olivia Paregol visited the university health center with a fever and sore throat on Nov. 2, one day after the university learned of the first adenovirus case. Her condition rapidly deteriorated, and it wasn’t until the teenager was fighting for her life at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Nov. 13 that David McBride, the health center’s director, informed the Paregol family about adenovirus cases on campus. Adenovirus, which is not governed by mandatory state or federal reporting requirements, can produce symptoms similar to a cold or flu. Certain virulent strains can sicken healthy individuals and be particularly dangerous to individuals like Olivia Paregol, who had a weakened immune system. Katie Lawson, the university’s chief communications officer, told the panel that she was not aware that public health officials had declared an adenovirus outbreak on Nov. 13. At a meeting on Nov. 15, McBride and other college officials discussed sending out an email to students living in Elkton Hall, the dorm where Paregol lived that had been temporarily evacuated because of mold problems. The report noted that the group decided to send a message about adenovirus to the entire campus but that “there was some delay” and it wasn’t finalized until the following day, on a Friday. The university planned to email it on Monday. Paregol died on Sunday evening, Nov. 18. “Throughout the handling of adenovirus notices, Ms. Lawson stated there was tension around wanting to be responsive to the community with more information than usual and guidance from state and county health officials, which was also coming from the CDC,” the report said. McBride, who left his job at the university several weeks after the start of the fall 2019 semester, did not return messages from The Washington Post seeking comment. During his interview with the panel, McBride discussed his efforts to assist students who had health problems related to the mold. He also said the decision not to take air samples before or after the mold remediation was a “subject of controversy.” The mold surfaced in Elkton Hall and other dorms as early as July 2018. During the unusually wet season, the university received more than 1,800 service calls related to mold at dorms across campus, the report said. Andrea Crabb, director of residential facilities, told the panel there were “communication breakdowns” with residential facilities staff during the cleaning and remediation. Crabb said she was advised by the college’s Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability and Risk that air sample testing should not be conducted. Mold does not cause adenovirus, but McBride, in emails previously reported by The Post, acknowledged that “mold can cause respiratory irritation that may increase susceptibility of any viral infection.” The Paregol family filed a notice of claim against the college in May and said they intend to move ahead with a wrongful-death lawsuit. Ian Paregol said university officials “still did withhold the information which caused my daughter’s death. They knew there was an adenovirus outbreak, and they should have told us and her to get checked when she came to the university health center after the first case of the virus.” jenn.abelson@washpost.com	879	"[{""start"": 252, ""end"": 426, ""text"": ""Olivia Paregol, an 18-year-old freshman, died of adenovirus on Nov. 18, 2018, after suffering from health problems during the several months she lived in a mold-infested dorm"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 428, ""end"": 603, ""text"": ""A Washington Post report in May revealed that university officials waited 18 days to tell students about the presence of adenovirus that eventually sickened about 45 students."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1287, ""end"": 1681, ""text"": ""The report concluded that the university “adhered to the requirements of all local, state and federal regulations and statutes governing reporting and communication concerning infectious diseases” and “the response to adenovirus was in accordance with the University’s own internal policies and procedures.” But the report identified “areas of weakness” and included 14 pages of recommendations"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1287, ""end"": 1681, ""text"": ""The report concluded that the university “adhered to the requirements of all local, state and federal regulations and statutes governing reporting and communication concerning infectious diseases” and “the response to adenovirus was in accordance with the University’s own internal policies and procedures.” But the report identified “areas of weakness” and included 14 pages of recommendations"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 428, ""end"": 603, ""text"": ""A Washington Post report in May revealed that university officials waited 18 days to tell students about the presence of adenovirus that eventually sickened about 45 students."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2900, ""end"": 3314, ""text"": ""Olivia Paregol visited the university health center with a fever and sore throat on Nov. 2, one day after the university learned of the first adenovirus case.

THE PROGNOSIS Actress Glenn Close still remembers vividly the dramatic and troubling scene when her nephew, Calen, had a psychotic break as a 17-year-old living in Montana. “He had to be put in a straitjacket and driven two hours to the closest place where he could get help,” Close said at a Washington Post Live event yesterday.  The lack of accessible help for Calen -- and that he had to go to the emergency room instead of getting treatment prior -- is part of the reason she’s asking Congress to expand and extend funding for mental health care through a pilot program scheduled to expire on July 1. Close became a mental health advocate after encountering serious illness within her own family — not just Calen, who has schizophrenia, but also her sister Jessie, diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic tendencies. She’s backing a program approved five years ago under a bill from Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), which the senators are now trying to expand from eight states to 19 states for another two years. The bill gives extra Medicaid dollars to community clinics in return for providing a wide range of mental health services. Its aim is to correct a shortcoming in the country’s health-care system, which often prioritizes care for physical ailments but not for mental conditions such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder. Under the pilot, more than 350 health clinics serving a quarter-million Medicaid patients have been able to get fully reimbursed by the federal government for the full range of mental health care. If funding isn’t extended, the centers may have to lay off 3,000 newly hired staff, cut off medication-assisted treatment to 9,000 patients and reestablish wait lists for mental health services, according to estimates provided by the senators’ offices. “We have seen psychiatric crisis services, 24-hour services, start up in the community,” Stabenow said. “So, someone’s not going to the jail, someone’s not sitting in emergency room for hours or maybe days trying to get help, and it’s transforming those communities.” Diagnoses of mental illness are on the rise in the United States, particularly among youth. Substance abuse, which often goes hand in hand with mental illness, has also spiked. Yet a large share of people don’t get the help they need, due to a variety of reasons including stigma, insufficient insurance coverage and the unique nature of mental illness, which can discourage patients from seeking care independently. That was the case for Close’s sister and her nephew. She described her shock when Jessie confided in her that she couldn’t stop thinking about killing herself. “Our family had absolutely no vocabulary for mental health,” Close said. “We just — we didn’t really get it…I had no clue. She was very good at keeping what she was going through from all of us.” The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that half of adults and teens with any mental illness and one-third of adults with serious mental illness don’t get any kind of treatment. Blunt and Stabenow’s bill tries to get at the problem by expanding mental health services covered via Medicaid, the government program for the low income which is also the single-largest payer of mental health services in the United States. To be eligible for the increased Medicaid payments, a clinic must be certified as a Community Behavioral Health Clinic. That involves showing it provides a comprehensive set of services including 24-hour crisis counseling, substance abuse treatment and mental illness screenings. Part of the idea is to make treatment more readily available to patients before they end up in emergency rooms or in the criminal justice system. “For the better part of 50 years the emergency room and law enforcement have been the de facto mental health delivery system in the country,” Blunt said. “And nobody is well served by that or satisfied by that.” Stabenow said she’ll never forget when the sheriff in Cook County, Ill., told her he had just hired a psychiatrist as a jail director. “He said, ‘Well, it’s real simple. Over half the people in my jail have mental health problems,’ ” Stabenow recalled. Then there’s the issue of stigma, a major reason people don’t seek out help before their illnesses make it hard to function. Both Jessie and Calen found the stigma around their illnesses was “just as painful” as dealing with the illnesses themselves, Close said. “Calen lost all his friends,” Close said. “Jessie felt that she was frightened to tell parents about her bipolar disorder because she was afraid they wouldn’t allow their children to come and play with her young daughter at the time.” There are signs that the stigma is starting to thin, as more public figures share their own experiences. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to share her struggle with depression that started in college and returned in her 30s. She described the experience as a “spiral” and called herself “one of the lucky ones” because she had insurance that allowed her to see a therapist. “Down and down I went, until I could no longer see hope on the horizon,” Smith said. “Now, I was never suicidal, but I was struggling to function. I definitely wasn’t living my best life; I really wasn’t living at all. And that’s the reality for mental illness for millions of Americans.” But talking more about mental illness has raised another concern among advocates: that it’s possible to address the topic in unhelpful ways, ways that could even trigger people to act upon suicidal thoughts. The Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” recently came under scrutiny when a study purported to find a spike in youth suicides in the month after the show was released. Close called the series “irresponsible.” “My sister went through suicide ideation,” Close said. “She tried to end her life twice. And I think you have to take responsibility because there’s so much potential for impact with our social media. You really have to take responsibility for the stories that you tell.” AHH: It took 18 days last fall for the University of Maryland to inform its students about the presence on campus of adenovirus. It’s a virus that can appear with symptoms similar to a cold or flu but can be dangerous for people with weakened immune systems, making early detection critical. The outbreak left one student, 18-year-old Olivia Shea Paregol, dead. More than 40 students were sickened overall during the outbreak in November and December and 15 people were treated at hospitals, our Post colleagues Jenn Abelson, Amy Brittain and Sarah Larimer report in this investigation about the outbreak told through Olivia’s story. The reporters spoke with more than 100 people during the course of their reporting to explain how the university’s communication delay left the community in the dark. After learning of the virus’s presence on campus, university officials “discussed — but decided against — notifying students with compromised immune systems and residents living in Elkton Hall, according to records reviewed by The Washington Post,” our colleagues write. “Many parents and students have denounced the administration’s handling of the viral outbreak and the mold infestation, complaining its actions endangered thousands of students, faculty and staff on campus,” they add. “In recent statements to The Post, university officials defended their actions ... They said they went beyond what was legally required to address the adenovirus outbreak and public health officials advised that it was not necessary to inform the public about the virus.” OOF: Five states — Virginia, Maryland, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin — said they will sue opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family that controls the company, for allegedly “deceptively pushing powerful painkillers and misrepresenting the drugs’ safety as the pills sparked the opioid crisis,” our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. The five states join at least 40 others that have filed suits against companies that are in some way involved in the making, distributing and dispensing of opioid drugs. Another 1,600 counties, cities and Native American tribes have filed claims that have been consolidated in a massive federal lawsuit in Cleveland. “All but Kansas targeted at least one member of the Sackler family, former president Richard Sackler, and Maryland named seven family members but not the company in an administrative filing,” Lenny writes. “In a news conference, West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey said his state was seeking to hold both the company and Richard Sackler responsible for deaths and other harms from the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.” “Even when it became apparent that thousands of people were dying of opioid abuse, Purdue doubled down by continuing its relentless and deceptive campaign” to push physicians to prescribe OxyContin, Morrisey said at the news conference. OUCH: The Ebola outbreak is only getting worse in Congo, as is widespread fear among health workers trying to combat the outbreak. The death toll has reached 1,136 this week, and the number of infections rose to 1,632. Misinformation has driven distrust of those in medical uniforms, making some doctors battling what is the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history afraid to wear their scrubs, as our Post colleagues Danielle Paquette and Lena H. Sun report. There have been 119 attacks this year against health workers, according to the World Health Organization, with 85 people wounded or killed. “And the violence hampers the response effort in a more direct way: Ebola infections tend to spike after attacks, experts say, because emergency responders are forced to take cover and halt the distribution of immunity-boosting vaccinations,” Danielle and Lena write. “Concerns are growing that the crisis in Congo’s North Kivu province could become as lethal as West Africa’s battle against the hemorrhagic fever from 2013 to 2016, which killed 11,310 people across three countries.” — House Democrats passed legislation yesterday to lower prescription drug prices and to reverse some changes made by the Trump administration around the Affordable Care Act, a move that sets up the Democratic Party with yet another chance to tout a health-care message ahead of the 2020 election, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports. In a 234-183 vote, five GOP members joined every Democrat in passing legislation to block rules from the Trump administration meant to encourage people to buy cheaper, short-term health plans that typically cover fewer services. The legislation also restores funding for advertising and other outreach to help people sign up for ACA marketplace plans. The package also includes three strategies to boost the availability of generic drugs, measures that initially had Republican support before Democrats packaged them with the measures to reinforce the ACA. “The upshot was a barbed debate: Democrats accused Republicans of disregarding consumers’ need for affordable, quality health care, and Republicans accused Democrats of thwarting a rare opportunity for bipartisanship,” Amy writes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Pelosi also took a jab yesterday at the Senate, which is not planning to consider the legislation. “I have some news for the distinguished leader in the Senate, the Republican leader,” she said. “The support for these bills is alive and well among the American people. He will be hearing from them because these bills are a matter of life and death and certainly quality of life for America’s working families.” — Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’Day defended the high cost of the manufacturer's highly effective HIV treatment, Truvada, before a House committee yesterday. “We have taken the disease from a death sentence to a manageable clinical condition, but we’re not done yet,” O’Day said. “We have to be sure that Americans get our medicines at a price that allows us to invest in research.’’ During the hearing, lawmakers questioned the high cost of the drug and noted it was research conducted by governent scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that helped develop Truvada, as our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports. “This treatment was developed as a result of investment made by the American taxpayers. The problem is that Gilead, the company that now sells the drug, charges astronomical prices,’’ House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said. He pointed to how the price has shifted from $800 a month when it was introduced in 2004 to now about $2,000 a month. “How can Gilead do this? How can our system allow a company to take a drug treatment that was developed with taxpayer funds and abuse its monopoly to charge such astronomical prices?’’ Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked O’Day why the drug’s list price is nearly $2,000 in the United States when it’s $8 in Australia. “Truvada still has patent protection in the United States, and in the rest of the world it is generic,” O’Day said. “I can’t comment on the price in Australia of the generic medicines, but it is generically available in other parts of the world and will be generically available in the United States as of September in 2020.” Christopher notes that scheduled generic availability is set to slash the company’s current earnings of $3 billion a year from the drug. — House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he opposes the new Alabama law that effectively bans all abortions in the state, saying it “goes further than I believe.”  “I believe in exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, and that’s what I’ve voted on,” McCarthy said at his weekly news conference, as our Post colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis report. He said rape and incest exemptions are “exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House.” His remarks came the day after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed what is the country’s strictest antiabortion law, outlawing abortions without any exceptions for rape or incest and which penalizes doctors who perform the procedure with up to 99 years in prison. “Republicans are wary of a reprise of 2012, when they lost two key Senate races in Indiana and Missouri after the party’s nominees in those states made comments about pregnancies resulting from rape,” Felicia and Mike write. “The debate over the Alabama law also comes at a time when Republicans are looking to make inroads with suburban women, a voting bloc that they lost when Democrats recaptured the House in 2018.” — Missouri’s Republican-controlled Senate made the state the latest in a slew of states to pass strict antiabortion legislation. Republican lawmakers voted 24 to 10 to pass a bill to ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy. The bill is now headed to the state’s Republican-controlled House, as our Post colleague Lindsey Bever reports. Republican Gov. Mike Parson has expressed support for the measure. Parson tweeted before the bill’s Senate vote: The bill would penalize any doctor who performs the procedure with up to 15 years in prison. It includes no exceptions for rape or incest, and only allows women to get an abortion after the eighth week of pregnancy in cases of medical emergencies, which it defines as “a condition which, based on reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.” In a statement to The Post, M’Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Missouri, said the GOP lawmakers “are putting the health and lives of Missouri women at risk in their race to make our state the one that overturns Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court.” — And here are a few more good reads:  Coming Up Sen.

A student at the University of Maryland died recently of an adenovirus-associated illness, the university said Tuesday. At least 11 children have died recently in New Jersey after an adenovirus outbreak at a health center there. In a statement, U-Md. said it learned Nov. 1 of what it said was then an “isolated case” of adenovirus. However, the statement, issued by David McBride, head of the campus health center, said that since then five more cases have been reported of students with confirmed adenovirus-associated illness. The student who died was identified by her father, Ian Paregol, as Olivia Paregol, 18, a freshman from Howard County, Md. She lived in a campus dormitory, her father said in an interview. She was “free-spirited and friendly,” he said. “Everybody she came across loved her.” She died Sunday in an intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, he said. Adenoviruses are common causes of colds, but certain strains can cause more serious illness. On Monday, the statement said, U-Md. learned that a specimen sent to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed adenovirus 7. That strain can cause more serious problems and was implicated in the New Jersey outbreak. Generally, U-Md. said, treatment for adenovirus illnesses includes rest, fluids and medicine to reduce fever. Unfortunately, the university said, no medication exists for adenovirus infection outside hospitals. It said vigilance was extremely important for those with chronic medical problems such as asthma, diabetes or illnesses that lower the immune system or for those taking medicine that weakens the immune system. Symptoms listed by the CDC included colds, sore throats and fever. U-Md. said they should not be ignored, and a doctor should be seen within 48 hours. In addition to issuing the notice and encouraging prevention, U-Md. said departments across campus began stepped-up cleaning of “high-touch” surfaces this month. Since learning of the Nov. 1 case, the U-Md. statement said, campus health officials have been closely monitoring for cases in coordination with the Maryland Department of Health and Prince George’s County Health Department by testing students at the health center and advising testing at facilities where ill students have been admitted. The statement said the campus health center staff has been on high alert and the center has “reached out to medical facilities in the area to heighten awareness of this illness.” In the New Jersey outbreak, health officials there said the deaths were among 35 adenovirus 7 cases at a nursing and rehabilitation center in Haskell. On its website, the CDC recommended preventive measures that include frequent washing; avoidance of touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and avoiding close contact with people who are ill. Olivia Paregol had lived in a dormitory, Elkton Hall, where mold was discovered this year. The university has said that it appeared that no consistent connection existed between mold exposure and the incidents of adenovirus. martin.weil@washpost.com	877	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 118, ""text"": ""A student at the University of Maryland died recently of an adenovirus-associated illness, the university said Tuesday"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 333, ""end"": 528, ""text"": ""However, the statement, issued by David McBride, head of the campus health center, said that since then five more cases have been reported of students with confirmed adenovirus-associated illness"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 804, ""end"": 1131, ""text"": ""She died Sunday in an intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, he said.

"THE PROGNOSIS Congress probably won’t do any big health-care things this year. But it might take some smaller action. Around Capitol Hill, pockets of legislators are partnering on incremental measures aimed at making health care more affordable for American consumers. In the past week, House and Senate members have released three separate bipartisan proposals to halt surprise medical bills. A fourth and more sweeping measure, rolled out yesterday by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) would also make drug prices more transparent and remove barriers to cheaper generic drugs, among numerous other provisions. “The steps we are taking on important issues like surprise medical billing, drug prices, maternal mortality and vaccine hesitancy show we can make progress when both sides are at the table ready to put patients and families first,” said Murray, the top Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb: Farzad Mostashari, former national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services: Axios reporter Bob Herman: Coming to the table is next to impossible for legislators on any major health-care proposals — measures that could close the country’s uninsured gap or force drugmakers to dramatically lower prices. The politics are just too charged. Republicans are refusing to help shore up the Affordable Care Act. In retribution, Democrats attached Obamacare measures they want passed to bipartisan drug pricing bills in a House vote last week. And as Democrats examine Medicare-for-all proposals, Republicans are working to undermine those ideas at every turn by casting them as socialism or charging that they’d result in rationed, low-quality care. Dissension is also brewing over how far to go on drug prices. Staffers for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are working on a plan, first reported by Politico, to allow Medicare to directly negotiate lower prices for at least 25 drugs a year, but that idea appears to be a non-starter among Republicans. But Alexander, Murray and others see opportunity on the margins, especially given the public’s overwhelming concern about health-care costs consuming ever more household income. Alexander, who chairs the HELP Committee, said his goal is to move the draft legislation through the committee next month and get it to the Senate floor in July. “There’s one issue I hear a lot about from Tennesseans, and it is, ‘What are you going to do about the health-care costs I pay for out of my own pocket?’ ” Alexander said. “Well, we’ve got an answer.” There’s a fifth bipartisan effort in the wings. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, say they’re partnering on a health package aimed at lowering drug prices. Grassley has said he wants to have that package ready by June. But it’s tackling surprise medical bills — the unexpected expenses that can arise when a patient gets treated by an out-of-network provider through no fault of their own — that is emerging as one of the most energized issues this year. In a speech earlier this month, President Trump called on Congress to pass surprise billing legislation and laid out some principles for how he would like it structured. On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Health subcommittee held a hearing on the subject. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.): Politico’s Dan Diamond: A key question legislators will have to answer is how to determine prices when patients receive unexpected out-of-network care. This can happen either during an in-network hospital stay — when they’re seen by an out-of-network specialist — or if a patient has to suddenly visit an emergency department outside their plan’s provider network. There’s broad agreement that patients shouldn’t have to bear these extra costs, but the various proposals have suggested somewhat different approaches for how insurers and providers should negotiate the such costs. —The “STOP Surprise Medical Bills Act” — proposed by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Michael Bennett (D-Co.) and three others — allows for an arbitration method whereby a third party mediates between insurers and doctors to decide on the fairest price. —The “No Surprises Act,” from Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and ranking Republican Greg Walden (Ore.), would link the payments to the market rate in the geographic area. —The “Lower Health Care Costs Act of 2019,” from Alexander and Murray, offers three options for negotiating prices, including arbitration. —The “Protecting People from Surprise Medical Bills Act,” which is just in outline form, was released yesterday by four House Republicans and four House Democrats. It also proposes an arbitration system. AHH: Health officials in five states were so worried that patients infected with measles were going to travel and spread the virus that they warned those individuals about a rare federal authority -- a ""Do Not Board"" list -- that could stop them from getting on planes. The warning worked, and the government authority was not invoked, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. “All eight individuals agreed to cancel their flights after learning the officials could ask the federal government to place them on a Do Not Board List managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” she writes. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health policy at Georgetown University, told Lena that while the travel ban authority is less restrictive than public health strategies such as isolation or quarantine, it “is seen as a government using its power over the people and the states, which is kind of toxic in America right now … There is nothing unethical or wrong about it. It’s just plain common sense that if you have an actively infectious individual, they should not get on an airplane.” New York's Rockland County Executive Ed Day wants a federal law requiring travelers to show proof of immunization. He wrote a letter asking the White House to “issue an Executive Order or task federal authorities to pass a law requiring visitors to present ‘certification of appropriate immunization,’ ” Lena reports. “A White House spokesman referred a request for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services, which referred the request to the CDC, which referred it back to HHS.”  OOF: The family of the 18-year-old University of Maryland student who died of adenovirus last year has taken a step toward a lawsuit against the school. The notice of claim against the University of Maryland was filed after our Post colleagues Jenn Abelson, Amy Brittain and Sarah Larimer revealed in a lengthy investigation that school leaders waited 18 days to inform students about the presence of adenovirus on campus. The outbreak sickened 40 students, including 15 who were treated at hospitals, and left one student, 18-year-old Olivia Shea Paregol, dead. “Ian Paregol said the family hopes to have discussions with college officials and will decide in coming weeks whether to file a lawsuit against the state’s flagship institution,” Jenn writes. “In the meantime, Paregol is calling for an independent investigation of the university and asking for the resignation or termination of President Wallace D. Loh.” Meanwhile, Loh has defended the school’s response to the outbreak. “Our approach to reporting, testing, cleaning and communicating about the virus was coordinated with health officials, and exceeded” guidelines from the CDC, Loh said in a statement. OUCH: New documents allege the patient in a vegetative state who gave birth at a long-term care facility in Arizona was repeatedly raped and may have been pregnant before, CNN’s Faith Karimi and Chris Boyette report. The woman, who had been at the Hacienda HealthCare facility in Phoenix since 1992, has left the facility where she gave birth to a baby boy in December, though no one at the facility knew she was pregnant. “Her lawyers filed a $45 million notice of claim to Arizona on Wednesday with allegations against the state along with Hacienda HealthCare,” Faith and Chris report. “The Maricopa County Medical Center examined the woman after she gave birth and concluded she’d been ‘violated repeatedly,’ the documents allege. Her giving birth was likely a ‘repeat parous event,’ which means she may have been pregnant before, the documents say. From the claim, it’s unclear whether she carried the previous pregnancy her family believes she had to term.” — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit announced it would hear oral arguments on July 9 in the state-led lawsuit that is seeking to wipe out the Affordable Care Act. The appeals court is considering a federal judge's December ruling striking the ACA. This week, the 21 Democratic attorneys general led by California defending the health-care law filed a brief arguing the challenge to the law lacks standing, that the individual mandate remains constitutional and that the mandate can be separate from the rest of the ACA even if it is deemed unconstitutional. “The Trump Administration has made clear that it will not defend Americans’ healthcare and the law that tens of millions of Americans across the country depend on — so our fight continues,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. — A bipartisan bill from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) to raise the age at which people can buy tobacco products is already facing hurdles, Politico’s Marianne Levine and Sarah Owermohle report. While lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to raise the purchase age to 21, some Democrats say the bill would give the tobacco industry leeway to influence state laws on vaping and other tobacco products. “They say a section of the bill that requires states to individually pass additional laws on the tobacco purchasing age would allow tobacco companies to influence the state legislative process and potentially water down related proposed regulations,” Marianne and Sarah write. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) is has threatened to vote against the bill. “There’s no reason that we can’t just do a clean bill, no loopholes, no tricks,” Schatz said. “I don’t want to dismiss it because there’s so much of it that’s good,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). He told Sarah and Marianne his staff is “taking a look at it to see if there’s anything that we ought to be mindful of that may be a loophole if we allow states to be lobbied by tobacco and vaping companies and modifications be part of it.” Schatz and Durbin have their own bipartisan bill with Sens. Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) that would raise the tobacco-purchasing age. — A new analysis from U.S. News found 14 percent of public high school students in California said they dealt with bullying or harassment in the past 12 months because of their race, ethnicity or national origin. The report found 6 percent said they experienced such treatment because of their perceived immigration status and 7 percent over their religion. Of the 395,000 students in grades 9 through 12 who were surveyed for the 2017-2018 school year, almost 53,000 said they experienced bullying over their race, ethnicity or national origin, while 24,000 left the question blank. “Aside from in-the-moment suffering, there’s evidence this discrimination takes a deeper toll: A further U.S. News analysis of data from the survey, which is managed by the state’s education department, shows an apparent link between experiences of bias-related bullying among adolescents and risky health behaviors like smoking and drinking,” U.S. News’s Deidre McPhillips reports. Students in public high schools in the state who experienced bias-related bullying also were twice as likely to have smoked cigarettes. And 40 percent of the students who experienced this treatment consumed alcohol, compared with 29 percent among those who didn’t experience such treatment. — And here are a few more good reads:  Coming Up Videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), manipulated to make her seem drunk, are spreading across social media:"	876	"[{""start"": 6625, ""end"": 7034, ""text"": ""The notice of claim against the University of Maryland was filed after our Post colleagues Jenn Abelson, Amy Brittain and Sarah Larimer revealed in a lengthy investigation that school leaders waited 18 days to inform students about the presence of adenovirus on campus.

"The University of Maryland sought this week to assuage concerns that adenovirus infections at the school might be tied to mold exposure, writing that it appeared there was “no consistent connection” between the two health concerns. A U-Md. student died Sunday of an adenovirus-associated illness. The university’s health center on Monday posted online a set of frequently asked questions about adenovirus. Earlier this semester, U-Md. dealt with mold in a campus dormitory — a problem that forced students to temporarily relocate to hotels. One of the questions posted online addressed concerns of a possible connection between mold and the virus. “The cases of adenovirus-associated illness on campus have been seen both in students living on and off campus and among students in residence halls affected by mold and not,” the website said. “As such, it appears that there is no consistent connection between mold exposure and the incidents of adenovirus infection affecting UMD students.” Similarly, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said no link exists between mold and adenovirus. That virus usually spreads from one infected person to another, the CDC said. That can happen through touching or shaking hands, or coughing and sneezing. It also spreads when people touch objects or surfaces on which the virus has landed, and proceed to touch their mouth, nose or eyes before washing their hands. The university on Tuesday said a student had died of an adenovirus-associated illness. The student, identified as 18-year-old Olivia Paregol, had lived in Elkton Hall, a dorm on the College Park campus where mold was discovered this year. Paregol, a freshman at the university, was from Howard County, Md. Maryland learned on Nov. 1 that a student was dealing with adenovirus, David McBride, director of the University Health Center, said in a statement this week. University officials worked with the state Department of Health and Prince George’s County Health Department to monitor for cases since that discovery. “The health center staff has been on high-alert and we have reached out to medical facilities in the area to heighten awareness of this illness,” McBride’s statement said. Since the first case emerged, McBride wrote, five more cases of students with “confirmed adenovirus-associated illness” have been reported. And one specimen, sent to federal officials for testing, showed an adenovirus strain that can lead to more serious health problems. Adenovirus-related illnesses are usually treated with rest, fluids and medicine to reduce a fever, according to the statement. “However, vigilance is extremely important for those with chronic medical problems like asthma, diabetes or illnesses that lower your immune system or if you take medicine that lowers your immune system,” McBride said in the statement. Concerns about mold have lingered this year on the College Park campus, where mold was reported throughout Elkton Hall, home to more than 500 students. The problem, which occurred earlier in the semester, worsened because of “significant rain and high humidity in our area,” according to a university statement at the time. To deal with the mold concerns, Maryland officials hired contractors, cleaned and replaced furniture and installed “commercial-grade dehumidifiers” in hallways. Students were temporarily relocated, a decision the university said it made “out of an abundance of caution.""

The leader of the University System of Maryland’s governing board on Friday pledged a “thorough, independent and transparent” review of top officials’ response to an adenovirus outbreak last fall at the flagship university in College Park that killed one student and sickened dozens of others. Linda R. Gooden, chair of the system’s Board of Regents, said in a statement that she hoped to meet soon with the parents of the student who died, 18-year-old freshman Olivia Shea Paregol. “On behalf of the board, I have reached out to Olivia’s parents and soon hope to meet with them and share our condolences, our concern, and our plans for moving forward,” Gooden said. “Those of us who are parents can only imagine the grief and sorrow they must be experiencing.” Gooden’s statement, during a meeting of the board, came a day after Gov. Larry Hogan (R) prodded the regents to take action. In a letter Thursday, the governor sharply questioned why the University of Maryland waited more than two weeks in November to tell the campus about the outbreak. Paregol, who had fallen sick weeks earlier, died Nov. 18. The next day, U-Md. leaders acknowledged that adenovirus was present on campus. “It appears that, at just about every turn, leaders withheld information instead of being open and honest with the student body,” Hogan wrote in the letter. “There should never be a question as to whether the campus community will receive timely and accurate information, especially when it is an urgent matter of public health and safety.” Hogan does not have direct authority over the university system, but as governor he is responsible for nominating regents to the board when vacancies arise. The university’s response to the viral outbreak — and persistent problems with mold in residence halls — has drawn fresh attention since The Washington Post reported in May that university officials waited 18 days to alert the campus to the presence of adenovirus on campus even as students were falling ill. The virus sickened more than 40 students, the university said, with 15 treated at hospitals. On Friday, a U-Md. spokeswoman reiterated a statement from Thursday: “The university remains committed to transparency — and student safety above all — in the handling of mold and adenovirus on our campus. Transparency has been demonstrated through legislative testimony, briefings to our Board of Regents, and real-time publishing of all actions and communications on mold and adenovirus throughout the fall. In addition, the university has made public the external review by medical experts of our response to adenovirus, and the findings support the university’s approach.” The Paregol family notified the university on May 20 of a potential wrongful death claim. Olivia’s parents believe the teenager — who was on medication for a digestive tract condition called Crohn’s disease — might have survived if her doctors had known sooner about the presence of adenovirus on campus. The virus can produce symptoms similar to cold or flu, but in some cases it can be lethal to those such as Paregol who have weakened immune symptoms. Gooden said in her statement that the board shares Hogan’s views on the need for a thorough examination of what happened to Paregol. She said the board has received three briefings since December on related safety issues from U-Md. President Wallace D. Loh. As the board was about to enter closed session Friday, Gooden said regents will “start the process of reviewing and discussing the options for working with President Loh and his executive team to see that there is a thorough, independent and transparent investigation of the work he and his team have done.” Ian Paregol, Olivia’s father, said he was “deeply concerned” about the wording of Gooden’s statement, especially her expression of intent to work with Loh. “I don’t know how it’s going to be impartial, how it’s going to be independent if they rely on the administration,” Paregol said. But a spokesman for Hogan praised Gooden’s action. “This is certainly a step in the right direction toward getting answers for the Paregol family and the U-Md. community,” Michael Ricci, Hogan’s communications director, said in a statement. “The governor believes that the Board of Regents is the appropriate body to conduct this review, and we are encouraged by today’s announcement.” nick.anderson@washpost.com	874	"[{""start"": 887, ""end"": 1049, ""text"": ""In a letter Thursday, the governor sharply questioned why the University of Maryland waited more than two weeks in November to tell the campus about the outbreak."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1050, ""end"": 1106, ""text"": ""Paregol, who had fallen sick weeks earlier, died Nov. 18"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1108, ""end"": 1528, ""text"": ""The next day, U-Md. leaders acknowledged that adenovirus was present on campus. “It appears that, at just about every turn, leaders withheld information instead of being open and honest with the student body,” Hogan wrote in the letter. “There should never be a question as to whether the campus community will receive timely and accurate information, especially when it is an urgent matter of public health and safety.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1686, ""end"": 2086, ""text"": ""The university’s response to the viral outbreak — and persistent problems with mold in residence halls — has drawn fresh attention since The Washington Post reported in May that university officials waited 18 days to alert the campus to the presence of adenovirus on campus even as students were falling ill.

THE PROGNOSIS It's extremely unclear whether the Trump administration will follow through on its promised vaping ban.  Now the government's top tobacco chief won’t even confirm the basic ideas President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar advanced two months ago, when they vowed to “clear the market” of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the worsening youth vaping epidemic. Azar in September said the ban would include not only fruity and dessert-flavored e-cigarettes, but also mint- and menthol-flavored products. (Officials later decided to exempt menthol because it’s less kid-appealing.) But at a Senate hearing yesterday, Mitch Zeller, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products, was noncommittal when Democrats probed him on whether the ban would include the full range of flavors. “Are you committed to finalizing the flavor compliance policy the administration announced?” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) asked Zeller at a hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. “Yes or no?” Zeller didn’t answer “yes.” Instead, he said this: “I think any questions the committee has about the announcement the White House made and anything related to what remains a deliberative process on policy is best referred to the White House itself.” But it’s anyone’s guess as to where the White House will land. Andy Slavitt, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama: In the meantime, some lawmakers are acting on their own. A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee unanimously passed a measure from Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) yesterday that would raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21, prohibit all flavored tobacco products and direct the FDA to issue regulations prohibiting all sales of cigarettes and e-cigarettes that aren’t face-to-face. Along similar lines, the Massachusetts state House passed a measure banning all flavored tobacco products and taxing vaping products. It also requires insurers and the state’s Medicaid program to pay for tobacco cessation counseling without any cost-sharing for patients. But the Trump administration’s delay in releasing the ban is befuddling many. Questions are swirling around exactly when it will be released, what products it will target and whether it will exempt independent vape shops. As I wrote earlier this week, health-care advocates worry the administration will give in to conservatives and industry by walking back the aggressive approach Trump and Azar had announced with much fanfare.  The White House Office of Management and Budget signed off on a policy more than a week ago, but it hasn’t yet been published in the Federal Register — a likely indication the administration is rethinking the details. Trump, adviser Kellyanne Conway and Domestic Policy Council Director Joe Grogan have all made comments in the past week that could be construed as favorable toward the vaping industry. Bloomberg News’s Jacquie Lee, reacting to remarks made by Azar at an Axios event yesterday: CNBC’s Meg Tirrell: The Hill’s Peter Sullivan: The details — whatever they are — are being ironed out by the White House and not the FDA. Zeller made that much clear yesterday, frustrating the Democratic senators by repeatedly referring all policy-related questions to the White House. A clearly annoyed Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) read Zeller the FDA’s Sept. 11 news release saying the administration’s policy would clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes. “I think we are entitled to an answer from you” on whether and when the administration intends to move forward, Kaine said. Zeller indicated the policy has not been finalized. “There is no final answer on the policy question,” he said. “That’s why we continue to have these internal discussions.” “I do not like being played games with,” Kaine snapped back at him. “I don’t like being told to get someone from the White House” to answer questions, given the White House often doesn’t send officials to congressional hearings. “We need you guys to focus on this,” Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) told Zeller. “We have children who are getting hooked on these products,” Hassan said. “We are looking for you guys to move through your deliberations. You’ve had enough time.” Here’s why politicians are showing a sense of urgency: While fewer students are smoking traditional cigarettes, the popularity of vaping has skyrocketed in the past few years. More than 1 in 4 high school students and 1 in 10 middle-school students now use e-cigarettes, according to the latest data from the FDA. Experts say vaping puts teens at risk for nicotine addiction and often starts them on a lifelong dangerous habit. There’s something else that has contributed to the sense of urgency. Vaping-related lung illness has sickened more than 2,000 people and led to at least 39 deaths, although officials now think the cases are related to the THC oil found in some vape products (we explained that here). Health advocates are pouring on the pressure for the administration to fully follow through.  The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network is running ads in The Washington Post and the New York Times today. Yesterday the group launched an ad buy on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, which includes airtime during the Sunday morning politics shows. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who left the administration in April, has gone so far as to call for products made by Juul — the largest e-cigarette maker — to be pulled off the shelves. “It’s very clear that Juul can’t keep their products out of the hands of kids,” Gottlieb said on Monday. “What’s driving the youth use if primarily Juul.” Laurie McGinley contributed to this report. You are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy. AHH: Azar said the administration is revising its proposal to lower some Medicare drug costs by pegging prices to lower international levels. He said Trump wants the U.S. to pay no more than other developed countries. Azar said during an event hosted by Axios that Trump was unsatisfied with the initial plan, the Hill’s Peter Sullivan reports. ”What we suggested was reducing that 180 percent premium [above other countries] by 30 percent,” Azar said. “The president did not find that satisfactory. His view, which he has articulated publicly, is that America ought to be getting the best deal among developed countries. That was the terminology of ‘most favored nation status.’ And so that’s the type of proposal we’re working on.” Trump first announced the action one year ago and in July said he was working on policy to require that the U.S. government pay no more than what other countries pay for prescription drugs. “We’re working on a favored-nation clause, where we pay whatever the lowest nation’s price is,” he told reporters in July. “Why should other nations like Canada — why should other nations pay much less than us? They’ve taken advantage of the system for a long time, pharma.” OOF: Federal regulators have opened an investigation into whether U.S. health privacy laws were followed in the effort between Google and health system Ascension that involved collecting detailed health information on millions of Americans. Roger Severino, the director of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, told Stat in a statement that “OCR would like to learn more information about this mass collection of individuals’ medical records with respect to the implications for patient privacy under HIPAA.” “The initiative, code-named ‘Project Nightingale,’ gave Google the ability to analyze personal health information, including names and birth dates, compiled by Ascension, with the goal of helping deliver more personalized medical treatment,” Stat’s Rebecca Robins reports. “The [Wall Street Journal] reported that patients and physicians were not informed of the project, though Ascension said that some clinicians and nurses were involved.” Google said in a statement that it is “happy to cooperate with any questions about the project. We believe Google’s work with Ascension adheres to industry-wide regulations (including HIPAA) regarding patient data, and comes with strict guidance on data privacy, security, and usage.” OUCH: Every 11 seconds, someone in the United States acquires an antibiotic-resistant infection, and about every 15 minutes, someone dies of one. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that deadly superbugs pose a greater risk than experts previously estimated. Previous figures missed about half of the illnesses and deaths, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports, but the new report found drug-resistant germs and infections sicken about 3 million people a year and kill about 35,000 annually. “Five germs account for the most urgent threats. Three are long-recognized dangers: C. diff., drug-resistant gonorrhea, and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE), also known as ‘nightmare bacteria’ because they pose a triple threat,” Lena writes. “They are resistant to all or nearly all antibiotics; they kill up to half of patients who get bloodstream infections from them; and the bacteria can transfer their antibiotic resistance to other related bacteria, potentially making the other bacteria untreatable.” “We want to have diagnostic tools and medical treatments for problems we know we’re going to have,” said Helen Boucher, chief of infectious diseases at Tufts Medical Center. “But we also need to prepare for the kind of resistance that we could never predict. We know from history that bacteria and Mother Nature are smarter than we are.” — An outside review found that the University of Maryland followed protocol in the adenovirus outbreak on campus last year that led to the death of one student, 18-year-old freshman Olivia Paregol. But the report also found “areas of weakness” and included 14 pages of recommendations for how to deal with such emergencies. In May, The Post reported that university officials waited 18 days before informing students about the presence of adenovirus that eventually sickened nearly four dozen students. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) called for an investigation, and the University System of Maryland Board of Regents picked six people with “subject matter expertise” to conduct that review, our Post colleague Jenn Abelson reports. “The report concluded that the university ‘adhered to the requirements of all local, state and federal regulations and statutes governing reporting and communication concerning infectious diseases’ and ‘the response to adenovirus was in accordance with the University’s own internal policies and procedures,’ ” Jenn writes. She added the report’s recommendations “included more frequent monitoring of disease trends on campus, sharing health information with regional providers, designating an individual responsible for crisis communications and conducting air sampling after mold remediation.” The Paregol family said it plans to move forward with a wrongful-death lawsuit against the college. Ian Paregol, Olivia’s father, said he appreciated efforts by the panel that conducted the review. But he also told The Post that university officials “still did withhold the information which caused my daughter’s death. They knew there was an adenovirus outbreak, and they should have told us and her to get checked when she came to the university health center after the first case of the virus.”  — And here are a few more good reads:  Coming Up	872	"[{""start"": 11204, ""end"": 11501, ""text"": ""But he also told The Post that university officials “still did withhold the information which caused my daughter’s death.

Three more students have been diagnosed with adenovirus at the University of Maryland’s campus in College Park, bringing the number of cases to nine in recent weeks. A letter sent to students indicated the new cases had been diagnosed over the Thanksgiving holiday, university officials said. In the letter, David McBride, director of the University Health Center, wrote that “none of these new cases has required hospitalization to our knowledge.” University officials said before Thanksgiving that the campus had recorded six cases of students with adenovirus. One student, 18-year-old Olivia Paregol, died Nov. 18 after being diagnosed with the illness. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan this week called Paregol’s death “very concerning.” A viral outbreak of the illness also left 11 children dead at a health center in New Jersey. Adenoviruses are “common causes of colds” and typically “found in significant numbers of people at this time of year,” McBride said. But certain strains of adenovirus can be more serious, according to the website for the school’s health center. For healthy people, treatment includes rest, fluids and fever-reducing medicine. There is no medication for the infection outside of hospitals. Officials advised those with chronic medical problems, including diabetes or asthma, or those taking medications that weaken the immune system to seek medical help within 48 hours of developing symptoms. University officials said they are working closely with state and local health departments to monitor the illness and test those who may have it. To stop the spread, the university is increasing the cleaning of “high-touch surfaces and restrooms” on campus. The dining services department is also increasing cleaning. The campus earlier in the fall worked to remove mold in some on-campus dorms, but officials said there is “no consistent connection between mold exposure and the incidents of adenovirus infection affecting UMD students.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends other preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing; avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and avoiding close contact with those who are ill. dana.hedgpeth@washpost.com	871	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 164, ""text"": ""ree more students have been diagnosed with adenovirus at the University of Maryland’s campus in College Park, bringing the number of cases to nine in recent week"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 449, ""end"": 655, ""text"": ""University officials said before Thanksgiving that the campus had recorded six cases of students with adenovirus.

"Seven children have died and others remain ill from a viral outbreak at a nursing home and rehabilitation center in New Jersey, health department officials said. Officials with the New Jersey Health Department said Wednesday that the seven “medically fragile children” were among 18 confirmed cases of an adenovirus among pediatric patients this month at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, not far from the New York border. Experts say the outbreak highlights the challenge of controlling infectious diseases in nursing homelike environments. Adenoviruses are ubiquitous viruses that can cause a variety of illnesses, from the common cold and conjunctivitis (pinkeye) to more severe diseases such as bronchitis and pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A spokeswoman for the state’s health department said that at least one of the patients who died was a toddler. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) said in a statement that he was “heartbroken by the news that several children have lost their lives in an adenovirus outbreak at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, and pray for the full recovery of the other children impacted."" The governor added that he has spoken with the state health commissioner, “who has assured me that the Department of Health has recommended vital measures to enhance protections against the further spread of infection and will continue its active on-site surveillance. I am confident that the steps being taken by state and local officials will minimize the impact to all those who remain at the facility, including patients and employees.” The strain responsible for the outbreak in the long-term-care facility in New Jersey is adenovirus 7, known for causing pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses. State health department officials said Wednesday in a statement that the strain “is associated with communal living arrangements and known to cause severe illness.” The state, with help from CDC, is investigating the outbreak. Health officials said in a statement that investigators have found “minor handwashing deficiencies” at the nursing home and rehabilitation center, which has 135 long-term-care beds and 92 pediatric beds, according to the health department. The department said it is working with the facility on “infection control issues.” Health officials said the center has been told not to admit any new patients during the outbreak. The Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation could not immediately be reached for comment. According to the center’s website, it offers short-term and long-term care, from physical and occupational therapies to hospice care, and has a pediatrics center for “medically fragile” children. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said that by adulthood, most people in the United States have been sickened by an adenovirus and recovered on their own. In patients with compromised immune systems, however, the viruses can be deadly. Adalja, an infectious-disease physician, said there is a nationwide problem with hospital-acquired infections — even more so with nursing home and rehabilitation centers, where, he said, “infection control is not as rigorous” because such facilities are not always set up to help prevent outbreaks. “It’s not surprising that this ferocious of a spread happened in a nursing-home setting,” he said, adding that “nursing homes are one of the weaker links in the chain of infection control.” Adalja noted that he does not know how the faculty in New Jersey is handling the outbreak, but he said the outbreak is considered “particularly severe” given the high number of fatalities. There have been similar outbreaks in the past. In 2006 and 2007, adenovirus 14 sickened at least 140 people across four states — New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington, according to CDC. Nine of them died, CDC said. Adenoviruses have also been a problem in military training centers, where men and women are under extreme physical and emotional stress and live in close quarters. For that reason, Adalja said, a Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine for certain strains is given to members of the military. But when outbreaks occur, he said, it prompts questions about whether vaccines should be available to the general public. To prevent transmission, CDC recommends that people avoid close contact with those who may be ill as well as practice good handwashing techniques and avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. There is no treatment for adenovirus, according to CDC, but the majority of cases clear up on their own. Read more: Can an upper-respiratory infection make you fat?

The University of Maryland health center said Friday that it has learned of 22 confirmed cases of students with Adenovirus. In four cases, tests showed the presence of Adenovirus 7, which can cause more severe illness than other strains. The death of one Maryland student has been linked to an Adenovirus infection. According to the health center, the 22 confirmed cases include a number of students who had were sick earlier in November, but have since recovered. In a statement issued Friday, the health center distinguished between Adenoviruses that cause colds and are widely found at this season, and a more dangerous strain, known as Adenovirus 7. It said that strain turned up in four specimens sent for testing. Adenovirus 7 , the statement said, may cause more severe illness particularly for patients with chronic medical problems, or with immune systems compromised by illness, or by medicine. For them, the health center said, “it is vitally important” not to ignore flu-like symptoms and to visit a physician within 48 hours of developing the symptoms. In describing flu-like symptoms, the announcement listed high fever and cough/sore throat and vomiting/diarrhea.

Eighteen days. That’s how long officials at the University of Maryland sat with knowledge that the highly contagious adenovirus was on the campus. Eighteen days. That’s how long they had to think about what might be on the doorknobs or in the air around them and to obsess, if they wanted, about washing their hands so they wouldn’t catch the virus and bring it home to their families. Eighteen days. That’s how long they kept critical information to themselves, knowing the students who had been entrusted to them were getting sick — some to the point of hospitalization. This week, the family of 18-year-old Olivia Paregol, who died during the outbreak, filed a notice of claim against the university. Her father, Ian Paregol, told The Washington Post that the family hopes to talk with university officials and will decide in coming weeks whether to sue. Regardless of whether a lawsuit goes forward, the only correct response from the university would be this: Put in place safeguards that guarantee this will never happen again. Paregol’s death against the backdrop of what the university knew and when it knew it — the details of which we know only because of diligent research and reporting by my colleagues — is horrifying and heartbreaking. But other students remain at the school. What assurance do they have that the university will put their well-being before its own image the next time a threat emerges? What assurance do they have that they won’t have to sit in the dark, unaware of a lurking danger, simply because officials decided they didn’t feel like sharing the light? Paregol’s death occurred just months after the campus mourned another student, Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old football player who collapsed of heatstroke during a team workout. If he had been immersed in cold water and treated right away, he might have survived, experts have said. Instead, more than an hour passed before paramedics were called, and by the time the teenager arrived at a hospital, his temperature was 106 degrees. That death alone should have been enough for the university to realize, and never forget, that delayed actions can be deadly. That much was obvious even before the university shelled out more than $1.57 million for an investigation into the incident. The story The Post published about the university’s response to the adenovirus outbreak was based on more than 100 interviews and thousands of pages of documents, including medical records, emails and text messages. Taken together, they appear to show a disturbing disregard for student safety. Even after officials were made aware that the school might be in the middle of an outbreak of the virus, which has been linked to other deaths, students received a campuswide email that mentioned only the flu and hand, foot and mouth disease. “This is no cause for alarm,” it read. By then, according to the story, Olivia Paregol had been out of school for a week and had told her friends that she had “puked blood.” Paregol, who was on medication for Crohn’s disease and had spent a semester sick from mold in her dorm room, had not been tested for the virus at that time. Her family learned there had been cases of it on campus, according to the story, only after the teenager ended up in a hospital and her father called a university official and pleaded, “I need some answers. I need to know what’s going on because she should not be this sick.” Parents entrust their children to colleges and universities. They also pay a lot of money to those institutions. They should never have to beg for basic information about health concerns on campuses, and especially not over their children’s failing bodies. On Nov. 13, tests confirmed Paregol had adenovirus. On Nov. 18, she died. Finally, on Nov. 19, the university acknowledged the virus had made students sick. After the Virginia Tech massacre — which saw a two-hour delay between an initial shooting and a campuswide notification that came shortly before the gunman killed 30 more people and then himself — universities across the nation adopted the practice of sending out alerts as soon as they receive reports of a possible shooter on campus. They should act just as swiftly when the threat is to student health. It costs nothing, and it recognizes their responsibility to all students, including those with compromised immune systems for whom the stakes of even a cold are higher. Yet, so far, these are the types of responses that have come from University of Maryland administrators: “I cannot speak to the medical care that Olivia received at emergency rooms or hospitals, or to whether or not an antiviral medication treatment could have saved her life,” University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh said in a statement to The Post. “We care tremendously about student health and well-being, and we offer our condolences to the Paregol family for this tragic loss.” “We responded as quickly as we could,” Linda Clement, vice president for student affairs, told The Post. Six months. That’s how long university officials have had since Paregol’s death to do something substantial about it. Six months. That’s how long they have had to admonish the administrators who were most responsible for the delay and to put in place policies that would reassure students who remain on the campus that there won’t be a next time. Six months. That’s how long they have had to publicly say, “We made the wrong call, and it had horrible consequences. We should have told students right away what we knew. But we will do what we ask of our students every day: We will learn. We will do better.” University officials might be worried right now about a lawsuit. They should be more worried about their students. theresa.vargas@washpost.com	868	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 145, ""text"": ""Eighteen days.

The University of Maryland at College Park said it is working to respond to a warning from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education that its accreditation is at risk. On Friday, the commission wrote to the institution informing it that its accreditation may be in jeopardy because of insufficient evidence that it is in compliance with standards on governance, leadership and administration. The commission found this spring that the institution appeared to be out of compliance after its investigation found that personnel actions taken following the June 2018 death of football player Jordan McNair show “that the Board of Regents and the UMD administration do not have a clearly articulated and transparent governance structure.” The commission has given the university until March 1 to show it has a structure that “outlines roles, responsibilities, and accountability for decision-making.” In a joint statement Friday, University System of Maryland (USM) Board of Regents Chair Linda R. Gooden, USM Chancellor Robert L. Caret and U-Md. College Park President Wallace D. Loh said, “Progress toward full compliance is already underway and will be completed” by the due date. USM administrators said in an email Sunday night that the board has taken a number of steps toward that goal, including appointing Gooden as chair, engaging the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges to conduct a review of the system’s policies relating to governance, and increasing board transparency. Katie Lawson, a spokeswoman for U-Md. College Park, said in an email Sunday, “Under the new Board chair, the university is encouraged by USM changes and increased collaboration. “The renewed commitment to openness and communication will ensure that the necessary actions are taken to secure autonomy and full compliance,” Lawson said. In the meantime, the university remains fully accredited. The warning from the regional accreditation agency follows a tumultuous and tragic year at the state’s flagship campus. McNair, a 19-year-old lineman on the school’s football team, collapsed from heatstroke during a practice on May 29, 2018, and died in a hospital 15 days later. An independent investigation found that school officials failed to properly diagnose and treat McNair, after it emerged that coaches waited an hour after he began showing troubling symptoms to call 911. Fallout from McNair’s death sparked turmoil on campus and within the university system’s leadership. Following an investigation into the actions of the athletic department and coaching staff, the Board of Regents recommended in late October that football coach DJ Durkin remain at the university. Loh said Durkin would stay, but the president announced he would retire at the end of the school year. The regents’ decision led to anger throughout the state, and the next day, Loh changed his mind and fired Durkin. The turmoil after McNair’s death led James T. Brady, then chair of the Board of Regents, to announce he was stepping down and prompted a public letter from the university’s provost and deans who said the regents’ actions could imperil the school’s accreditation. “We, the academic leaders of the University of Maryland, write to express our dismay and deep concern for the events and the process that has led to the forced retirement of President Wallace D. Loh,” they wrote. “We have been extremely alarmed for weeks by the interference of the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents into University governance matters. It is the President who is responsible for personnel matters at the University, and it is within the President’s discretion and authority to decide whether to retain athletics staff. Through its intervention, the Board of Regents usurped the President’s authority and intervened in the ability of the President to carry out his full duties and responsibilities.” In February, the university provided the commission with a report “in relation to the series of actions by the Board of Regents, President Loh, and the University Senate that transpired in the aftermath of the tragic death of student athlete Jordan McNair and the subsequent review of UMD’s football program.” Lawson, the UMD spokeswoman, said the accreditation warning was “related to whether the Board of Regents was directly involved in personnel decisions at the university last fall, and not to “the handling of the care of Jordan McNair or his tragic passing.” Universities rely on accreditation because the U.S. Department of Education requires it for a school to be eligible for federal student financial aid. Students at a school that has lost its accreditation also can find themselves unable to transfer their credits to another, accredited institution. The Middle States commission is one of seven regional accrediting agencies that oversee the country’s colleges and universities. Brian Kirschner, a spokesman for the commission, told The Washington Post in November that the agency sought information from the school that related to two required standards: ethics and integrity and the student experience. Although the warning should be taken seriously, the university is highly unlikely to lose its accreditation, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, an organization representing the ­higher-education community. “It is uncommon, but certainly not unknown for accrediting agencies to raise questions about a college or university at any time, but particularly after a widely publicized event or a situation where a university’s handling of an issue might not have been as smooth as it could have been,” Hartle said. Penn State University received a similar warning after the child sexual abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, and the University of North Carolina was warned after news reports of academic violations by athletes, Hartle said. “This is not good news for a university; it’s something they would prefer not to happen,” he said, adding that the university needs to demonstrate to the commission that it realizes things were “managed badly” and that steps have been taken to prevent that from happening again. In its email Sunday, the USM administrators said the board recognized that “its final decisions could have been handled more effectively. Middle States has noted both this lapse as well as the actions taken by the board to prevent a reoccurrence.” This is not the first such warning for the University of Maryland system. In 2016, the commission issued a similar warning to Frostburg State University, saying it needed to improve learning assessment; the university made corrections and announced that its accreditation was reaffirmed the following year. The College Park campus also is reeling from the death last fall of an 18-year-old freshman from adenovirus. In May, the family of Olivia Shea Paregol filed a notice of claim against the school, setting the stage for a possible lawsuit. Paregol’s father said her death could have been prevented if the university had disclosed that the virus was spreading through the campus. The commission’s warning does not appear to be related to that event. tara.bahrampour@washpost.com joe.heim@washpost.com	867	"[{""start"": 6762, ""end"": 7136, ""text"": ""The College Park campus also is reeling from the death last fall of an 18-year-old freshman from adenovirus.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is calling on the University System of Maryland Board of Regents to investigate the handling of an adenovirus outbreak last fall on the flagship College Park campus that killed an 18-year-old freshman and sickened more than 40 other students. Hogan, in a sharply worded letter sent Thursday morning to the university system’s governing board, said the circumstances surrounding the November death of Olivia Shea Paregol should be investigated immediately with specific attention paid to decision-making by university officials who waited 18 days to tell students about the presence of the virus. “It appears that, at just about every turn, leaders withheld information instead of being open and honest with the student body,” Hogan (R) wrote. “There should never be a question as to whether the campus community will receive timely and accurate information, especially when it is an urgent matter of public health and safety.” Hogan’s letter followed a report by The Washington Post that revealed university officials remained quiet for more than two weeks as the virus spread through campus and landed students in hospital emergency rooms. The director of the University of Maryland’s student health center waited until after Paregol’s death to inform students about the viral outbreak. In the coming days, the regents say they will review and discuss the options for meeting the governor’s directive and will work with officials on the College Park campus to see that a “thorough and transparent investigation takes place.” The university said in a statement Thursday it will “be forthcoming and accessible and will work closely with the Board and the Governor’s office to provide information and understanding about our actions and close coordination” with state, county and federal health officials. The Board of Regents during the past year oversaw two investigations into the death of another U-Md. student, Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old football player who succumbed to heatstroke in June 2018. The investigations, which cost nearly $1.7 million, found various problems, including that athletic trainers waited more than an hour to call 911 after McNair showed signs of exhaustion. “Mr. McNair’s death rightfully prompted multiple investigations and brought to light numerous inadequacies in how the university dealt with a medical emergency,” Hogan wrote. “Unfortunately, I am deeply concerned that the University learned nothing from that troubling and tragic episode.” While U-Md. President Wallace D. Loh took “legal and moral responsibility” for the death of McNair, Loh has denied shortcomings in the university’s response to the viral outbreak. “Our approach to reporting, testing, cleaning and communicating about the virus was coordinated with health officials, and exceeded” U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Loh said in a statement after The Post published its report May 16. A Board of Regents spokesman previously told The Post that the chancellor of the university system has asked all presidents in the University System of Maryland “to review their policies, processes, and communications related to incidents of infectious diseases and environmental hazards to ensure best practices in responding to these matters.” Hogan, in his letter, pressed the governing board to go further and review the handling of the adenovirus outbreak, including the response by the student health center, and publicly release its findings. “The Paregol family’s grief has been considerably worsened by the lack of urgency — and lack of transparency — shown by university officials before and after Olivia’s death,” Hogan wrote. “There are serious questions about how this happened, and the families who entrust their children to your care deserve your assurance that they will receive answers.” Ian Paregol, the father of Olivia Paregol, said he hoped a “truly independent body” would examine the circumstances surrounding the outbreak and his daughter’s death, including communication with public health officials and compliance with the college’s infectious disease response policies. The Paregol family, which notified U-Md. on May 20 of a potential wrongful death claim, believes the teenager could still be alive if the university had not withheld information about the presence of adenovirus, giving doctors more time to administer an antiviral treatment. Adenovirus can have symptoms similar to a cold or flu, but some virulent strains can sicken healthy adults and be lethal to individuals with weakened immune systems, such as Olivia Paregol, who was on medication to treat Crohn’s disease, a chronic digestive tract condition. In these cases, early detection can be key to treating severe adenovirus, according to medical experts. David McBride, the director of the university health center, first learned Nov. 1 that a student had been hospitalized with adenovirus. The next day, Paregol visited the university health center complaining of a sore throat, fever, fatigue and swollen lymph nodes, according to medical records. No one mentioned that adenovirus could be a possible cause of her sickness. Adenovirus was making national headlines because it had been linked to the deaths of children with weakened immune systems living at a long-term care facility in New Jersey. That outbreak killed 11 children and sickened more than two dozen. Paregol languished as doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of her illness. On Nov. 13, her father called the university pleading for answers while the medical condition of the freshman deteriorated at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. It was only then that McBride disclosed to Paregol’s father that there were adenovirus cases on campus. Paregol tested positive for adenovirus that day and doctors quickly began an antiviral treatment. The teenager died five days later. Ian Paregol said any investigation into U-Md. should also examine overcrowding and mold in the dorms. A mold outbreak sickened College Park students and set the stage for additional health problems. Olivia Paregol had struggled with respiratory problems during the fall semester while living in Elkton Hall, a mold-infested dorm from which students had to be relocated. Mold does not cause adenovirus, but McBride, in emails to administrators, acknowledged that “mold can cause respiratory irritation that may increase susceptibility of any viral infection.” “Students were at greater risk for adverse health consequences because the university also failed to disclose, test, clean using proper practices, and certify that Elkton Hall was free of mold,” Ian Paregol told The Post. “We see all of these aspects as demonstrating a reckless pattern of disregard for the health and safety of staff and students, where the university has placed its own public relations needs ahead of the students’ health.” Paregol, who is weighing whether to file a lawsuit in coming weeks, has called for the resignation or termination of Loh, the U-Md. president. A board of regents spokesman recently said the board is not considering the employment status of Loh, who is planning to step down in 2020. The university in its statement Thursday said it “remains committed to transparency — and student safety above all — in the handling of mold and adenovirus on our campus. Transparency has been demonstrated through legislative testimony, briefings to our Board of Regents, and real-time publishing of all actions and communications on mold and adenovirus throughout the fall. In addition, the university has made public the external review by medical experts of our response to adenovirus, and the findings support the university’s approach.” Adenovirus, unlike some other infectious diseases such as measles, is not governed by mandatory state or federal reporting requirements. Several public health officials advised U-Md. it was not necessary to disclose the outbreak. Ultimately, college leaders had the authority to decide when and how to share information about adenovirus with students. University officials discussed but decided against notifying students with compromised immune systems and residents living in Elkton Hall, according to records reviewed by The Post. Campus leaders waited until Nov. 19 — the day after Paregol’s death — to acknowledge the virus was present on campus and took an additional day to disclose that a student had died from adenovirus. They say they sent an email to the campus communicating that a student had been diagnosed with adenovirus 7 — a strain that can result in severe infection – after they received authorization from state health officials to release the information. “It should not take the death of a student for the university to alert families about an illness spreading through campus, whether it is a common cold or meningitis like the university saw in 2014,” Hogan wrote in his letter to the board of regents. “Caution is sometimes understandable and called for, but common sense should never be overruled by bureaucratic protocol when lives are on the line.” jenn.abelson@washpost.com	866	"[{""start"": 9, ""end"": 267, ""text"": ""Gov.

As students at the University of Maryland’s flagship campus made their way back to school for the fall semester, officials installed 50 sensors to monitor moisture and humidity in a dozen buildings. The move followed a tumultuous year at the College Park campus. Last fall, sprouting mold and an adenovirus outbreak engulfed the school in controversy. Then, last month, anthropology professors complained that persistent mold in their offices had destroyed belongings and made them sick. Carlo Colella, the school’s vice president for administration and finance, said the heightened monitoring of campus facilities has helped officials stay on top of maintenance problems. “We feel very comfortable that only a few of our buildings have persistent atmospheric moisture issues and that’s why we are deploying this moisture watch program, to stay ahead of that as best we can,” Colella said. Even as U-Md. moved to improve environmental monitoring, students who live in a cluster of apartment-style residences belonging to the university reported recent episodes of mold and flooding. Jared Bennett, 19, a sophomore, said he has been battling mold in the bathroom since he moved into Old Leonardtown, a collection of apartment-style residences on the southern end of campus. “They’re just generally very humid, and the air-conditioning [units] are old. In the bathrooms, the shower curtains are hung too low, so everything grows mold,” Bennett said. “It’s most concerning, the amount of mold that grows, and, no matter how many times we clean it up, it comes back.” Students are expected to permanently move out of Old Leonardtown at the end of this school year, with the 1970s-era structures later being demolished, student newspaper the Diamondback reported. About 225 students live in the complex, according to the university’s website. Michael Robidoux, 19, said rain showers Oct. 20 flooded his bedroom, although he did not find mold. “We realized that most of our floor was pretty wet. Rain had come through the walls and soaked our carpet,” the sophomore said. “It’s been pretty frustrating.” A university spokeswoman said Old Leonardtown is not experiencing persistent problems and described mold growth reported in one apartment as an “isolated incident.” U-Md. spent $30,000 to purchase and install the sensors. So far, they’ve been planted in three dorms and nine academic buildings. School leaders said they hope to identify mold growth before it leads to infestation. Data is collected manually from the devices every 48 hours, said university spokeswoman Katie Lawson. In November, the sensors will be replaced with “smart sensors” that share readings in real time. Michael Kletz, an allergist and immunologist with practices in the District and Northern Virginia who is not affiliated with U-Md., said the sensors could be a useful mold abatement tool. “It’s much easier to get rid of mold when it starts than once it’s already grown,” Kletz said. “The thing about mold is that it tends to increase, or is more likely, when it gets humid. When the humidity is kept to a minimum, there’s less of a chance of the mold growing. But it’s still possible to have mold grow, even in deserts.” The university expects to spend $84,000 a year to keep the sensors working and to monitor the data, Lawson said. The campus purchased 50 additional sensors to keep in reserve in case moisture problems arise in other buildings, university spokeswoman Natifia Mullings said. The introduction of the mold monitoring system follows criticism leveled at the school for its handling of last year’s infestation and for an adenovirus outbreak that left one student dead and more than 40 other students ill. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) called on the university to investigate its response to the adenovirus outbreak. Officials waited 18 days to tell students the virus was present on campus. Olivia Paregol, an 18-year-old freshman with a compromised immune system, died of complications from the virus. A panel assembled in the spring was supposed to deliver a report to the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents this month, but officials don’t expect it to be complete until November, said Tim McDonough, spokesman for the system. “The governor demanded a thorough and transparent investigation of the outbreak, and has urged the regents to act quickly for the sake of the Paregol family and the entire campus community,” said Hogan spokeswoman Shareese DeLeaver-Churchill. In a letter to the Paregol family’s attorney, Hogan said he told his staff to “follow up with the University of Maryland and find out why the investigation has not been completed in a timely manner and to express my disappointment in the time it has taken to be responsive to my request.” In Elkton Hall, where Paregol lived, first-year students said they haven’t seen mold this school year. Nearly 600 students were forced to evacuate the dorm a year ago. “This building, I feel a lot safer in it because I know they did a lot of remodeling,” said Michelle Badolov, 18. “We have air conditioning and dehumidifiers, which a lot of the other buildings don’t have.” Isabella Irving, 18, said school leaders emphasized mold prevention when students moved in. “That was a big thing they talked about the first weekend we were here,” she said. Professors in Woods Hall — a 70-year-old building that houses the Anthropology Department — have been complaining about mold for years. Jen Shaffer, an assistant professor, said she stopped meeting with students in her office because she was worried mold might make them sick. Colella said he wasn’t sure whether the conditions in Woods Hall posed a threat to students. “I haven’t spoken to that faculty [member],” he said. The offices Shaffer and her colleagues occupy in the building’s basement will be torn down by next semester to improve air flow, Colella said. The basement will probably be converted into a workspace for graduate students. “We’ve done a number of things over the years,” Colella said. “Each of them have improved but not adequately.” Since last year’s mold and adenovirus episodes, U-Md. has started 100 renovation projects in 19 residence halls and 11 sorority and fraternity houses, Colella said. The upgrades include window replacements, dehumidifier installations, heating and air-condition system upgrades, and foundation waterproofing. Those improvements come amid broader upgrades on Maryland’s public higher education campuses. The University System of Maryland, which oversees the College Park campus and 11 other higher education institutions, said campus presidents plan to spend more than $1.1 billion over the next five years to maintain, renovate and replace buildings. About $640 million was spent the past five years on building infrastructure in the statewide system. “A primary driver of this [University System of Maryland] focus is providing our students, faculty and staff with healthy, functional, attractive and innovative living and learning environments,” McDonough said. “Such efforts take into account climate change and would include state-of-the-art building systems.” University leaders said they are trying to get ahead of problems and respond quicker when they emerge. “In all of our spaces for all of our community members, health and safety is our paramount concern, so if there is a situation in a building, or an office or a room that is requiring us to address it, we are addressing it,” Colella said. lauren.lumpkin@washpost.com	865	"[{""start"": 263, ""end"": 486, ""text"": ""Last fall, sprouting mold and an adenovirus outbreak engulfed the school in controversy.

It had been six days since Olivia Shea Paregol walked out of the University of Maryland health center without an answer for why she felt so awful. Now, the 18-year-old freshman was curled up in the fetal position on the floor of her dorm room at Elkton Hall in College Park, her brown hair resting on the shaggy white rug. She warned her friends, Sarah Hauk and Riley Whelan, to stay away from a plastic bag where she had just vomited. The teenagers hoisted Olivia up and shuffled to the elevator. Once inside, Olivia leaned against the wall and slid to the floor. “Don’t sit down,” Riley said. “Come on, it’s just a short ride. You can do this.” “I literally can’t,” said Olivia, the words slicing her sore throat like knives. “I have to lay down.” Olivia had been sick most of her first semester living in an overcrowded dorm that was infested with mold. But her symptoms now were far worse than a cough and congestion. Her skin was pale, and dark circles cupped her eyes. The lymph nodes in her neck had swollen so much they felt like golf balls. The freshman — who turned late-night trips to the dining hall into stargazing adventures, belted out Miley Cyrus songs on demand and easily flipped strangers into friends — was sprawled across the elevator floor. Sarah and Riley linked arms with Olivia and made their way through the dorm lobby into the cool night of Nov. 8. They watched as Olivia trudged to a parking lot where her dad was waiting in his car. She didn’t turn back to wave goodbye. As Olivia battled her mysterious illness, the University of Maryland was rocked by turmoil. Widespread mold that fall had forced the temporary evacuation of nearly 600 students in Elkton Hall after outraged parents besieged officials at the state’s flagship university. The administration already was dealing with a full-blown scandal over the death of Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old football player who succumbed to heatstroke in June. Athletic trainers had waited more than an hour to call 911 after he showed signs of extreme exhaustion. His death exposed deep problems within the athletic department and led to the dismissal of the football coach, the retirement of the university president and resignation of the chairman of the university system’s governing board. In November and December, the University of Maryland would become the epicenter of an outbreak of adenovirus, which can have symptoms similar to a cold or flu. But certain virulent strains can sicken healthy individuals and be particularly dangerous to people with weakened immune systems — people like Olivia, who was on medication for Crohn’s disease, a serious digestive tract condition. In these cases, medical experts say, early detection can be key to treating severe adenovirus. But the university waited 18 days to tell the community after learning the virus was present on campus. Officials discussed — but decided against — notifying students with compromised immune systems and residents living in Elkton Hall, according to records reviewed by The Washington Post. As the days passed, more and more students fell ill. Many parents and students have denounced the administration’s handling of the viral outbreak and the mold infestation, complaining its actions endangered thousands of students, faculty and staff on campus. In the end, more than 40 students were sickened with adenovirus, and 15 of them treated at hospitals, according to the university. Mold does not cause adenovirus but can set the stage for other health problems. The director of the university health center, in emails to administrators, acknowledged that “mold can cause respiratory irritation that may increase susceptibility of any viral infection.” In recent statements to The Post, university officials defended their actions, saying they hired a remediation company to remove the mold in September and provided guidance to students on how to prevent the spread of viruses. They said they went beyond what was legally required to address the adenovirus outbreak and public health officials advised that it was not necessary to inform the public about the virus. In April, the college hired two outside doctors to review the school’s response. They found the university followed policies and procedures. “The actions we took are in line with CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance on adenovirus outbreaks and were consistent with the University’s strong commitment to the health and safety of our students,” said David McBride, director of the health center. In early November, the virus was quietly spreading through campus. Only days after Olivia had slumped in the elevator at Elkton Hall, she was fighting for her life at Johns Hopkins Hospital. On Nov. 13, her father frantically called the university from the intensive care unit in Baltimore. When McBride called back, Olivia’s father pleaded for information. What’s going on with the mold? Or was there something else on campus making students sick? LEFT: Olivia Paregol takes a selfie with her parents, Ian and Meg, at the University of Maryland in September. RIGHT: Students move into Elkton Hall, which would later be evacuated because of mold. (Family photo; photo by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Olivia, or Livy Shea, as her family and friends called her, grew up in a small community west of Baltimore and considered going to college in South Carolina. She loved beaches and had a soft spot for country music. Mostly, she wanted a university with a lot of school spirit. She planned to study criminology, inspired by the TV show “CSI.” During her senior year of high school, Olivia was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an incurable condition. She began treatment at Hopkins that left her immune system weakened. At college, she would give herself injections of Humira, an anti-inflammatory medication, every two weeks. Olivia’s parents, Ian and Meg Paregol, wanted their daughter, the baby of the family, to stay close to home. When Olivia was accepted at the University of Maryland, it checked all the boxes and was only an hour away. After Olivia learned she had been assigned Room 3152 at Elkton Hall, she felt lucky to have landed in a dorm with air conditioning. On Aug. 24, Olivia’s family stuffed two cars with dorm supplies and headed to College Park. She had coordinated colors with her 18-year-old roommate, Megan Sassaman, and bought a cream-colored tapestry with a map of the world to hang in their third-floor dorm room. Olivia’s parents tucked handwritten notes of encouragement in her dresser drawer before saying goodbye. Elkton Hall, an eight-story, red-brick dorm located in the shadow of the university’s football stadium, was bursting with students. Built in 1966, it was designed to hold about 530 students, but nearly 570 were squeezed into the building because of a large freshman class. Study lounges had been converted to dorm rooms for four students and some rooms for two residents now housed three. Students crammed the narrow halls and communal bathrooms on each floor. They waited endlessly for elevators because one of the three was always broken. It was one of the soggiest summers in Maryland history. By the end of September, more than 50 inches of precipitation had fallen. Eventually, 2018 would go down as the region’s wettest year on record. Olivia’s room felt like a swamp, so humid that bath towels never dried. The air-conditioning unit in her room stopped working in the first week of September and had to be fixed repeatedly. By mid-September, Olivia and her roommate, Megan, had persistent coughs, and it seemed harder than usual to breathe. A pungent odor hung thick, and it was impossible to ignore whenever Riley and Sarah, 18-year-old freshmen who lived together on the eighth floor, visited Olivia’s room. Mold had surfaced earlier that summer in Elkton Hall and other dorms across campus. University officials dispatched housekeeping staff to wipe off visible mold before students arrived in August, according to workers interviewed by The Post. With damp conditions and overcrowding, it didn’t take long for the mold to return. It began to invade Elkton — on the blinds, under the beds, inside sneakers and all over the cooling units. On Sept. 18, a resident assistant sent a message to students on Olivia’s floor instructing them to check their rooms for mold: “Best way to see it is in the dark using a flashlight . . . It’ll probably look fuzzy and green.” “we got mold,” Olivia texted Riley later that day. “how bad,” Riley asked. “look under ur drawers on ur dresser,” Olivia responded. “that’s where we have it.” The campus again sent housekeeping staff, who said that they were untrained in mold removal and without the proper protective gear, to wipe down desks and chairs with an all-purpose disinfectant. The workers were beset by scratchy throats, itchy eyes and headaches. Some called in sick and visited the health center. After Megan’s mother complained, staff replaced their dressers, blinds and desks. But the mold grew back in rooms across Elkton. Housing officials hastily called a meeting on Sept. 21 to address the mold in Elkton Hall as parents descended on the campus that Friday for Family Weekend. “You have a sick building with 600 children,” one mother told university officials at the meeting. Students cried about being ill. McBride, 50, handed out business cards and told the roughly two dozen parents and students in attendance to call him at the health center if they had concerns. He had spent his early career as a physician at a community health center outside Boston. It was there, he said, that he learned the importance of engaging with people outside of the clinical setting. McBride later led student health services at Boston University before arriving at the University of Maryland in 2014. During the meeting at Elkton, housing officials insisted they only learned of the latest mold outbreak in recent days and blamed it on the unusually wet weather. Mold under a desk in Olivia's room and on a sandal belonging to Megan Sassaman, her roommate, from late September. (Photos by Megan Sassaman) Hours after the meeting, administrators announced they would move students out of the dorm over the coming weeks and pay for them to stay in local hotels. They would hire an outside specialist to clean the mold and an engineer to examine the underlying cause. That report would find that at Elkton Hall, there were “longstanding concerns for humidity levels.” Cooling systems installed in 2011 were not designed to remove moisture from the air and allowed humidity to rise, making the building susceptible to mold growth, the report said. Mold outbreaks on campus were not new or confined to Elkton, according to workers; articles in the Diamondback, the student newspaper; and documents reviewed by The Post. Since 2017, the university has received reports of mold at all 38 residence halls in College Park, records show. In recent years, other colleges have grappled with mold outbreaks. In October, the University of Tennessee closed a dorm housing roughly 600 students for the rest of the year. Last fall, Montclair State University in New Jersey tested mold spore levels before and after remediation even though there are no federal or state requirements to do so. The University of Maryland, where in-state tuition, housing and other costs run about $25,000, took a different approach. It would rotate students out floor by floor while the remediation was ongoing, starting at the top of Elkton, where residents had made more complaints about mold. And, at the recommendation of the campus environmental safety team, the college said it decided against testing the type of mold, noting the Environmental Protection Agency has said such testing is unnecessary. Riley and Sarah, who both battled coughs and congestion, on Sept. 23 moved to the nearby Cambria Hotel with other eighth-floor residents. Contractors in hazmat suits and masks began cleanup efforts at Elkton. A health and safety specialist who inspected Elkton on behalf of the campus labor union said the building’s condition was so bad that it looked as though it were filled with floodwater. Workers placed dehumidifiers in the hallways throughout the building. On Olivia’s floor, a tube drained water from a dehumidifier into a drinking fountain. Olivia and her roommate, Megan, weren’t scheduled to move out for another 10 days. Olivia, meanwhile, couldn’t stop coughing. On Monday, Megan walked to the student health center, a red-brick building in the heart of campus, for the second time that month. Megan said that during a breathing test a physician assistant asked whether she was trying hard enough because her oxygen levels had dropped. Megan complained in an email to university officials about how she had been treated. “[It] made me feel as though my symptoms were pushed under the rug yet again,” Megan wrote on Sept. 25 to University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh and others. She mentioned Olivia’s illness and said: “I continue to live in an unhealthy environment. The lack of communication and lack of acknowledgement of the issue saddens me and comes across as if the University puts student health as a low priority.” After more than a week of relentless coughing, Olivia now had a sore throat and chest congestion. On Sept. 26, she also visited the student health center at the urging of her parents. There, a doctor diagnosed her with an unspecified viral upper respiratory infection with a cough and “exposure to mold,” according to her medical records. She was prescribed cough medicine and a nasal saline spray. In an effort to understand the effects of the mold infestation, health center staff, at McBride’s direction, had begun to take note of where students who came for treatment were living and if their respiratory symptoms were worse inside the dorms. After the relocation plan was announced on Sept. 21, Megan’s parents, Kim and Kevin Sassaman, sent emails to top university officials asking why Megan and Olivia couldn’t be moved to a hotel sooner, given their poor health. With approval from a housing official, the two students moved into the Cambria on Sept. 26. The roommates stocked up on beauty masks and snacks for their makeshift dorm room. Two days after they checked into the hotel, McBride, the director of the health center, wrote Olivia that a doctor there “let me know that you’re feeling unwell and that mold may be a factor. I know that you’re scheduled to move for cleaning in early October. Do you want for me to advocate for a sooner move to another location on campus until after the cleaning is complete?” Olivia responded: “My roommate actually already had us moved. Thank you for reaching out, but I’m already in a hotel at the moment.” After 11 days in the hotel, Olivia and Megan moved back into Elkton Hall, where the remediation was winding down. Parents increasingly took to social media to vent about conditions on campus. On Oct. 8, they started to complain on Facebook that their children were misdiagnosed at the health center, were told they had unspecified viruses or couldn’t even get an appointment. In an interview, Angela Hayes said her son, a freshman who lived in Easton Hall, repeatedly sought help for a sore throat and high temperature. Health center staff told him he had a virus. When he didn’t improve, she said, he went to a nearby urgent care center, where he was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics. “It was almost like a factory,” Hayes said of the university health center. “They’d tell students, ‘You’re fine, you’re fine, you’re fine.’ ” McBride told The Post that in October he noticed an uptick of fever-associated illnesses that were not the flu. He scheduled a meeting in early November of the Campus Infectious Disease Management Committee, a group that evaluates health threats. In mid-October, Debbra Aiello’s 18-year-old son, who lived in La Plata Hall, called her at home in New Jersey complaining of a bad headache, sore throat and high fever. She drove down to College Park and brought him back to a pediatric emergency room in New Jersey. He had a 104-degree fever, and after a battery of tests, doctors determined he had an ear infection and adenovirus. Aiello said she had never heard of adenovirus and had no clue that it could severely sicken a healthy teenage boy. It took him nearly a week to recover at home. When his father drove him back to College Park, the son fell ill again, so they headed to the health center. But there was a two-hour wait. They left campus and drove to an urgent care facility. Had the health center been able to treat the student, the university might have learned much earlier about the dangerous virus snaking its way through campus. Midway through the fall semester, the death of Jordan McNair still dominated headlines. In late October, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents huddled behind closed doors to discuss an investigation launched in the wake of his death that revealed poor management of the athletic department. During a May 2018 workout, Jordan had hyperventilated and complained of cramps, but athletic trainers waited for about an hour to seek emergency help. He underwent a liver transplant before dying in June. “You entrusted Jordan to our care and he is never returning home again,” President Loh told the McNair family. The case led to a review of the university’s accreditation, which could threaten the school’s federal funding. On Oct. 30, the Board of Regents recommended that football coach DJ Durkin keep his job, triggering a barrage of criticism, including from Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R). The next day, the university reversed course and dismissed Durkin. The chairman of the Board of Regents would also resign amid the turmoil. As this was unfolding, Olivia languished. She bailed early from a Halloween party, where she was dressed as one of the Three Blind Mice. She had painted her glasses black, dark enough to cover her puffy eyes, and told friends it pained her to speak. “i can’t swallow my own spit,” Olivia texted Sarah on Oct. 31, “and my neck is so lumpy bc my lymph nodes so swollen.” That day she went to her family doctor, where a pediatric nurse practitioner tested her for strep but found none. Two days later, on Nov. 2, as her symptoms worsened, Olivia’s father urged her to visit the campus health center. There, she complained to a physician that she had a fever, fatigue and a sore throat and mentioned that a friend had mono. The doctor ordered a test for mono, but Olivia didn’t have time to wait at the lab. That evening, she was headed to a birthday celebration for her sister. At the dinner, Olivia whispered in between coughs that she was sure she had mono. Her father worried about her weakened immune system and was determined to take her home from school. To his surprise, she did not object. Olivia soon retreated to her childhood bedroom. Over the weekend, she complained of chills and took hot showers to soothe her shivering body. “r u coming back today?” Riley texted her the afternoon of Nov. 4, a Sunday. Olivia replied that she didn’t know. “my fever won’t break,” she wrote. The university’s first warning of adenovirus among students came the day before Olivia’s Nov. 2 visit to the health center. McBride received an email from a physician at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, who told him about a College Park student who had been hospitalized there and tested positive for the virus. “I thought it best that you know in case there are more,” wrote the physician, James Campbell. In a follow-up phone call that day, Campbell told McBride that the student had been admitted with a high fever and pneumonia, according to records and interviews, and was suffering from “an unusual presentation” of adenovirus. The virus was in the news: It had been linked to the deaths of children with weakened immune systems living at a long-term care facility in New Jersey. The outbreak ultimately killed 11 children and sickened more than two dozen others. Certain strains can severely sicken healthy adults. The military has had multiple fatal outbreaks in barracks. A vaccine is available to military personnel but has not been approved for the general public. Soon after the phone call with Campbell, McBride learned that a student who had been seen at the health center with a fever and respiratory problems had been admitted to Washington Adventist Hospital in Maryland, according to interviews and records. McBride suspected it was a second case of adenovirus and asked the hospital to run a test. On Nov. 7, McBride convened the meeting of the Campus Infectious Disease Management Committee, which included about a dozen officials from student affairs, athletics, communications, housing and other departments. They discussed updating the campus plan for disease outbreaks. McBride told them about the increase in fever-associated illnesses on campus and several cases of hand, foot and mouth disease, which causes a mild rash and mouth sores. McBride, however, did not advise the committee of the confirmed case of adenovirus or the second suspected one, according to the minutes. Asked why he didn’t bring up adenovirus, McBride told The Post that it is “not currently a reportable condition . . . we were more focused on what we knew at that time.” Unlike some other infectious diseases, adenovirus is not governed by mandatory state or federal reporting requirements — doctors or hospitals are not required to alert health officials or the public when the virus is discovered. Two days later, on Nov. 9, Andrew Catanzaro, a physician at Washington Adventist, followed up with McBride and emailed him that he was concerned about “others coming into the hospital who are quite ill . . . Perhaps you have an outbreak of Adenovirus on the campus.” That day, the campus health center began testing for adenovirus. The nasal swab used to detect adenovirus is significantly more expensive than a flu or strep test, and it is not available at many primary care and urgent care clinics. That Friday evening, McBride sent out a campuswide email about flu and virus prevention techniques, such as washing hands, and noted that there had been several cases of hand, foot and mouth disease. He made no mention of adenovirus. “This is no cause for alarm,” he wrote in boldface type, “but it does give us the opportunity to practice effective prevention techniques for these types of illnesses.” By then, Olivia had been out of school and at home for a week, except for a brief visit to Elkton to pick up her medication. She kept Sarah and Riley in the loop, texting “i just puked blood.” She returned to her pediatric nurse practitioner on Nov. 5. The following day, her parents took her to the emergency room at Howard County General Hospital, where doctors treated her as if she had bacterial pneumonia and sent her home with antibiotics. But the medication wasn’t working, and her chest began to hurt when she coughed. Three days later, Olivia’s parents brought her back to Howard County hospital. She was admitted and tested for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis and bacterial blood infections, records show. All came back negative. But physicians did not test for adenovirus. They knew she had pneumonia but it was unclear as to what had caused it and why she wasn’t getting better. They continued to treat her with antibiotics. Howard County hospital officials later declined to answer questions about why they did not test Olivia for adenovirus. Ian and Meg Paregol traded off nights sleeping on a small couch next to Olivia’s hospital bed. Ian, an attorney who represents clients with disabilities, had learned how to advocate for patients under difficult circumstances. He barely slept as he watched his daughter’s oxygen levels dip well below normal on Saturday night. Olivia’s left lung was filling with fluid. On Nov. 11, with her condition worsening, Olivia was moved into the intensive care unit. Doctors suggested puncturing her back with a needle to help drain fluid from her lungs. Olivia, now struggling to speak, asked: “Will it hurt?” Suddenly, her eyes rolled back and she suffered a seizure, thrashing against the bed. Medical staff rushed in, and Ian, fearing she was dying, ran from her bedside into the hallway. He fell to his knees and started to pray. Doctors intubated Olivia and administered sedative drugs. That night, Howard County physicians planned to airlift her to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, where she could undergo a Hail Mary treatment: the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine or ECMO. Tubes circulate and oxygenate the patient’s blood outside of the body, giving the heart and lungs a chance to recover. Ian and Meg drove to Hopkins. They took the elevator to one of the top floors of the hospital and stood by the window. There, they stared into the night sky and waited for the flashing lights and whirring blades of their daughter’s helicopter. Back on campus, Sarah’s text messages to Olivia went unanswered. “Okay you’re scaring me,” Sarah wrote. “I just wanna know ur okay/coming home tomorrow.” Olivia’s roommate, Megan, was too sick to leave their dorm room. Megan had tried to get an appointment at the campus health center, but nothing was available. On. Nov. 12, Megan’s mother, Kim Sassaman, wrote to Loh and McBride about her daughter’s illness and questioned whether mold remained in the dorm room. She asked for “full disclosure” on what was making her daughter and other students sick. “Her constant illness is not an isolated case in Elkton,” Sassaman wrote. She alluded to Olivia, saying that Megan’s roommate was hospitalized with pneumonia and another student — their 18-year-old friend Humza Mohiuddin — had been hospitalized with respiratory issues. McBride responded quickly and traded emails with Megan’s mother. “We’ve discovered several cases of a particularly nasty strain of adenovirus (a typical cold virus),” McBride wrote in one message. “If Megan has not been tested for this, we can either perform a swab at the UHC for it or you can ask her current caregiver to test for it.” By then the state Department of Health was aware of the outbreak. On Nov. 12, Catanzaro, the infectious disease physician at Washington Adventist, alerted the state about two students who tested positive for adenovirus. The next day, McBride learned that a student tested at the health center was also positive for adenovirus. At Hopkins, doctors began the ECMO treatment for Olivia and ordered dozens of tests, including a screening for respiratory viruses that could detect adenovirus. After Olivia showed no improvement on Nov. 13, Ian, in a panic, called the university. When McBride returned the call later that day, Ian pressed him about her illness and any connection to mold. “I need some answers,” Olivia’s father pleaded. “I need to know what’s going on because she should not be this sick.” “We’ve had a couple of cases of adenovirus appear,” McBride responded, according to Ian. He said he told McBride to immediately call Hopkins to share what he knew. Later that afternoon, McBride left a voice mail for Ian, saying he had spoken to medical staff at Hopkins: “The state health department is getting involved as well, so we can try to prevent further spread of the virus called adenovirus, which is actually a pretty common cold virus. But every once in a while it causes a more severe illness. So we suspect that’s what it might be.” Suddenly, Ian had a sobering realization: For the past week, doctors had been giving her a cocktail of antibiotics, which would only be effective if a bacterial infection were the underlying cause. But the true culprit had been a virus. Although many people recover from adenovirus on their own, immunocompromised patients with severe cases, such as Olivia, can benefit from antiviral drugs, such as cidofovir. The drug carries significant risks, including kidney failure, and has not been studied in large-scale trials for use in treating adenovirus. “You want to start it before the patient gets too sick,” said Ivan Gonzalez, a physician at the University of Miami who has studied the use of cidofovir in adenovirus patients with compromised immune systems. In Olivia’s case, doctors didn’t wait. On Nov. 13, hours after tests confirmed she had adenovirus, they began to administer cidofovir. That afternoon, Linda Clement, vice president for student affairs, wrote to Loh, “We have three cases of adeno . . . it is likely [Prince George’s County] will declare an ‘outbreak.’ ” About two weeks had passed since McBride learned of the first adenovirus case on campus. The unofficial tally of students with the virus was up to at least five, three of whom required hospitalization. There probably were many others who had not been diagnosed. The University of Maryland was now navigating one of the country’s first adenovirus outbreaks on a college campus. Still, there was no announcement. On Nov. 14, McBride sent an email to Richard Brooks, a CDC employee assigned to the state health department, and shared the university’s campuswide virus prevention email that was sent on Nov. 9. McBride asked Brooks, who works with state officials on outbreaks, if the CDC wanted the university to do more “adeno specific communication” with people on campus. Later that day, Brooks responded by email: “Based on our conversation with CDC, we don’t think additional, more specific messaging about adenovirus is necessary at this point in time.” On Nov. 15, McBride gathered the infectious disease committee — this time to talk about the growing number of adenovirus cases. The university’s plan for responding to low-level health threats states that officials should be “providing information to the community about the infection in question, increasing prevention measures in resident halls/dining halls/public locations.” The group suggested conferring with Katie Lawson, the university’s chief communications officer, about sending a message to students who had compromised immune systems and to residents of Elkton Hall given “heightened sensitivity” over the mold, according to minutes of the meeting. No message was sent that day alerting students, but McBride warned his counterparts at Georgetown, George Washington, American, Howard, Towson and other regional colleges. In an email, he told them about a “cluster” of adenovirus cases, noting that three students had been hospitalized, including one in “very serious condition.” “Please keep your eye out for this on your campuses,” he wrote on Nov. 15. At Hopkins, additional tests soon revealed that Olivia had adenovirus 7, a virulent strain responsible for the deaths of children in New Jersey. When Angela Crankfield-Edmond, a health official with Prince George’s County, learned on Nov. 16 that preliminary results showed Olivia had the pernicious strain of adenovirus, she wrote to McBride, “Please do not tell anyone until we get the final result.” Crankfield-Edmond later said the state instructed her not to make anything public until final results were available. Hopkins physicians continued to give Olivia cidofovir and also began a blood treatment designed to boost her immunity. But it made no difference. Fluid rapidly accumulated in her once slender 130-pound body. By Nov. 16, she had swollen to 232 pounds. Her blood pressure plummeted. Her kidneys and liver were failing. Glenn Whitman — an ICU physician at Hopkins — gathered Olivia’s family in a conference room to explain the best chance to save her life. An open abdominal surgery could release fluid and pressure. An adhesive film would temporarily hold Olivia’s organs in place. If she survived, she could face up to a year of recovery in a hospital bed. Ian and Meg asked him: What would he do? Whitman broke down into tears. He had children as well, he told them. And he would do everything to save the Paregols’ daughter, just as if she were his own. On Facebook, Ian asked family and friends to pray as Olivia underwent surgery on Saturday, Nov. 17. The pulse within her feet had become faint. Now doctors were struggling to pick up a pulse in her legs. Amputation was a possible last resort. Ian and Meg tried to channel Olivia’s mind-set. At what cost would she be willing to live? “Ultimately what we really need is a miracle,” Ian posted on Facebook. Early Sunday morning, on Nov. 18, the Paregol family made the 45-minute drive home from Hopkins to shower and change clothes. A nurse called with grim instructions: Come back as soon as possible. With permission from Ian and Meg, doctors stopped giving Olivia blood pressure medication. They warned that she could die within minutes. Country music — Olivia’s favorite — played in the room as her parents and two siblings, Zoe and Evan, took turns by the teenager’s bedside. They remembered the vacation to Turks and Caicos and trips in the family Prius with Olivia crammed in the middle seat between her brother and sister. One by one they held her hand for hours that Sunday afternoon and told her how much they loved her. At 10:15 p.m. on Nov. 18, Olivia Shea Paregol was pronounced dead. Doctors listed three causes of death: organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and adenovirus. LEFT: Meg Paregol stands in her daughter Olivia's bedroom at her home in Glenwood. RIGHT: Ian Paregol sits for a portrait after getting a tattoo in memory of Olivia. (Photos by Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Early the next morning, McBride wrote to Brooks, the CDC employee working with state health officials, saying he had an unconfirmed report that Olivia had died. Given that she had adenovirus 7, he wondered if they should go public. “We’ve discussed internally here, and we don’t feel that this changes our plans to do any messaging,” Brooks responded an hour later. “To be clear, we are not recommending that you NOT put out any additional communications (i.e. if you feel the need to send any additional messaging, we are fine with that). We just aren’t recommending that you need to do so.” After reaching out to the state, McBride faxed the result of Megan’s test at the campus health center to her family doctor — she also had adenovirus. Around 2:30 p.m. that day, Nov. 19, McBride sent out a campuswide email that for the first time publicly acknowledged adenovirus, saying that there were six confirmed cases over the past two weeks. The next day, he revealed in another email to the campus that the virus had killed an unnamed student — Olivia — and urged others to take the virus seriously. McBride privately expressed concern that an upcoming news article in the Baltimore Sun about the adenovirus outbreak might suggest that the University of Maryland “should have done more,” he wrote in an email to Crankfield-Edmond, the Prince George’s County health official. “There was nothing else you could have done,” responded Crankfield-Edmond, who days earlier had told McBride to remain silent. “It’s a cold virus that is in the community.” The next day, on Nov. 21, McBride appeared on a local television segment and defended the university’s response to the adenovirus outbreak. “While we want to acknowledge that there are cases on campus, we don’t necessarily want to stir up unnecessary angst,” McBride said in the interview. The Paregol family spent Thanksgiving planning a funeral. Two days later, on a rainy Saturday, the ground so wet that heels sunk into the mud, Olivia’s family and friends gathered at the Good Shepherd Cemetery in Ellicott City, Md. Olivia’s longtime pediatrician, Jacqueline Brown, attended the service. Brown kept revisiting the early days of November, when Olivia had come into her office, ailing without an apparent cause. Brown said she would have recommended an adenovirus test if she had known that the virus was circulating among Maryland students. “If we were looking for it sooner, then maybe the treatment might have worked,” Brown told The Post. “I think by the time that that’s what we realized, she was already very sick. And I’m not sure that it started in time to have made a difference.” The following Monday, McBride publicly announced that there were three more cases of adenovirus. On Nov. 28, four days after burying Olivia, her father wrote to McBride, accusing the university of a “pattern of indifference” and questioning the failure to alert Olivia about adenovirus. “The information could have saved her life and a proper course of treatment could have been identified well before we were told about Adenovirus on 11/13,” he wrote, referencing his phone call that day with McBride. Ian told McBride that had physicians known what to look for, the antiviral treatment “could have been initiated long before she became critically ill.” The Paregols wanted to sit face-to-face with the university president and try to understand why their daughter was dead. Two teenagers within six months had lost their lives. Ian and Meg wondered: Had the school learned nothing from Jordan McNair? In early December, the Paregols gathered around a coffee table in the president’s office. Ian sat across from Loh, and Meg faced Clement, McBride’s supervisor. By then, the University of Maryland had disclosed that adenovirus had sickened at least 30 students. “My condolences to your family,” Loh said. “This is such a terrible loss.” After an uncomfortable silence, Ian began peppering Loh with questions. Ian wanted Loh to understand the connection he saw between the mold infestation and the adenovirus outbreak. Ian said he knew that mold did not cause the virus, but the mold had made Olivia sick all semester. That made her more susceptible to other respiratory infections, such as adenovirus, he said. Her system was already compromised from her Crohn’s medication. Ian asked Loh who had made the decision to stay quiet about adenovirus since it was discovered on Nov. 1, the day before Olivia visited the health center. Loh, according to the Paregols’ recollection, responded that he had many employees and relied on their expertise for advice. “You’re the president,” Ian said. “You’re the face of this university. You make the decisions. So this is all on you.” After 30 minutes, the Paregols said an official began to usher them from the room. The family insisted on a few more questions but left unsatisfied with Loh’s responses. In a statement to The Post, Loh, who is planning to retire in 2020, said: “I cannot speak to the medical care that Olivia received at emergency rooms or hospitals, or to whether or not an antiviral medication treatment could have saved her life. We care tremendously about student health and well-being, and we offer our condolences to the Paregol family for this tragic loss.” Clement, in a recent interview with The Post, said she stood by the decision to take 18 days to publicly disclose the presence of adenovirus and felt reassured after two outside physicians reviewed the response to the outbreak. “We responded as quickly as we could,” she said. “They confirmed that the way we handled it was well done.” A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins Medicine, which operates both Howard County General Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital, declined to answer specific questions about Olivia’s treatment. “We are deeply saddened about the death of Olivia Paregol,” the spokeswoman said in a statement. “Ms. Paregol was diagnosed with an adenoviral infection, for which there is no FDA-approved treatment. Her case was quite complex, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to summarize it in a brief media statement.” At Elkton Hall, students were skeptical of the university’s efforts to eradicate the mold. Days after Olivia’s funeral, her friends Humza and Megan returned to the dorm and found mold growing on the shoes in their closets. Housing officials gave Humza a humidity monitor for his room. Megan eventually decided she had had enough and transferred to a school in another state. In early January, Sarah and Riley joined Olivia’s family at Elkton Hall to clear out the rest of her belongings. Olivia’s parents and sister pulled up to the dorm on a cold, cloudy morning. They stood silently with housing officials and waited for the elevator, holding empty duffel bags. Ian asked to go the eighth floor where Sarah and Riley had decorated a bulletin board with red construction paper and photos of Olivia’s brief time on campus. They wanted to feel like she was still a part of Elkton. As he looked at his daughter’s face, Ian broke down in tears. In Room 3152, Sarah and Riley began to sort through Olivia’s clothes. They took some T-shirts, a pillow and folded up the tapestry of the world map. They planned to hang it on the wall of their on-campus apartment in the fall. Sarah lay down on Olivia’s bed and stared at the ceiling. She wiped tears from her eyes. Several days later, Sarah returned to Elkton Hall to move in for the spring semester. She walked toward the elevator and looked up at the bulletin board. Olivia’s smiling face was gone. All of it had been taken down. How this story was reported: Reporters interviewed more than 100 people, including students, parents, university employees, and county, state and federal health officials. Health-care providers and mold and adenovirus experts were also consulted. The reconstruction of events, including conversations, was based on thousands of pages of medical records; hundreds of emails, text messages, voicemails and other reports; and documents provided by sources and through public records requests. The Washington Post requested emails from the University of Maryland that mentioned “mold” or “adenovirus.” The Post also asked the university to waive any fees, arguing that disclosing the documents would be in the public’s interest. Officials denied the fee waiver and estimated it would cost more than $63,000 to produce 25,000 responsive documents. The scope of the request was narrowed to 300 pages and it cost $690. The Post also reviewed emails provided through state and county records requests. Julie Tate and Rick Maese contributed to this report. Editing by David Fallis and Jeff Leen.
