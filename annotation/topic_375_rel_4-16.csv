A coalition of eight states announced plans Thursday to boost the use of electric cars and other zero emission vehicles, promising incentives and an improved network of fueling stations to encourage consumers to buy the vehicles and prompt manufacturers to produce more of them. The eight governors who signed the agreement, including Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), hope to put at least 3.3 million zero emission vehicles on their roads by 2025. To accomplish that, they pledged to install more electric charging stations, introduce or continue tax breaks for consumers and add such vehicles to government fleets. Some other states have similar incentives, though they did not join the group. Collectively, the eight states — California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont — represent about 23 percent of the U.S. auto market, according to information the group released Thursday. “We think it’s doable,” said Mary Nichols, chairman of the Air Resources Board in California, the biggest market in the group. “The market is moving fast. It started from zero and it accelerated very quickly.” Nichols and others said the greatest obstacle to overcome is consumer resistance to new technology. Buyers must be convinced that the vehicles will work for them, she said, a process that usually requires seeing them on the road or in a neighbor’s driveway — not just in an advertisement. “Once we are able to get the word out to consumers that there is an infrastructure out there, and [it is] all over the state … we’ll be able to encourage a greater desire to get an electric vehicle in Maryland,” said Samantha Kappalman, a spokeswoman for O’Malley. U.S. motorists bought about 52,000 electric cars in 2012, up from about 17,000 in 2011, according to the group. More than 40,000 plug-in cars were sold in the first half of 2013. In addition to all-electric cars, the group wans to encourage production and purchase of fuel cell vehicles, which run on hydrogen, and plug-in hybrids , which have both electric and gasoline engines. Fossil fuels burned to power cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes were responsible for 28 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2011, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Maryland wants to put 60,000 zero emission vehicles on its roads by 2020, Kappalman said, and will add another 110 to 160 public charging stations to the 430 that exist. In addition to the $7,500 federal tax credit available to buyers of such vehicles, the state offers a $1,000 excise tax credit, a $400 tax credit for any equipment purchased and access to HOV lanes, she said. In 2012, 1,764 electric vehicles were sold in Maryland, up from 227 in 2011. This year’s sales will surpass last year’s, she said.	40	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 277, ""text"": ""A coalition of eight states announced plans Thursday to boost the use of electric cars and other zero emission vehicles, promising incentives and an improved network of fueling stations to encourage consumers to buy the vehicles and prompt manufacturers to produce more of them"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 277, ""end"": 616, ""text"": "".

Toyota and Hyundai brought their hydrogen-fueled cars to the nation’s capital on Wednesday, the day before the Washington Auto Show opens its door to the public. The car companies hope to highlight clean-tech alternatives to plug-in electric vehicles at the expo, which industry insiders have dubbed the “public policy show” because of its proximity to federal decision-makers. This year’s lineup includes one of the most diverse displays of green technology, including ­battery-powered electric engines, hybrids, clean diesel and hydrogen-fueled cars, said Washington Auto Show chair Kevin Reilly, who also owns Alexandria Hyundai. “Within 12 months, there are now more options for a policymaker, and ultimately a consumer, to look at in terms of how to power my vehicle,” Reilly said. Hyundai came to the show to feature its Tucson Fuel Cell ­crossover-utility vehicle, expected to reach the market at a few Hyundai dealers in Southern California this spring. The model takes less than 10 minutes to charge at special fueling stations and can travel about 300 miles per charge. The car would initially be offered only for lease. A 36-month agreement would require an initial payment of about $3,000, and payments of about $500 a month. Toyota is showing off its own hydrogen fuel-cell concept car, which it unveiled in the United States at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month. Toyota expects the car to reach the market in 2015. Nissan, meanwhile, announced it would test a new electric vehicle concept car in the Washington area though a partnership with FedEx Express, an express-delivery subsidiary of the shipping company, starting as early as March. This is the first time the e-NV200 Concept, a compact, fully electric cargo vehicle, will be driven in North America, the company said. Nissan is field testing it to determine its viability in the United States, and will begin mass production in Spain in the spring. The Washington Auto Show — organized by the Washington Area New Auto Dealers Association — recognized Cadillac’s ­energy-efficient brake technology, awarding the company its annual Green Car Technology Award. Cadillac’s ELR Regen on Demand technology uses the car’s electric motor as an electricity generator while braking, and allows motorists to engage or disengage the feature while driving. In a keynote at the show, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz announced that the Energy Department would commit about $50 million to accelerating development of new transportation technologies, especially in cost-effective batteries, advanced heating and improved fuels, among other innovations. The funding would continue to support the department’s “EV Everywhere Challenge,” which aims to make electric vehicles more affordable and convenient than gasoline-powered cars in the next decade. “Today, the American auto industry is on the rise, experiencing the best period of growth in more than a decade,” Moniz said. “The new research and development funding announced today will help support our domestic automakers’ continued growth and make sure that the next generation of advanced technology vehicles are built right here in America.” The Washington Auto Show is held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, running from Thursday to Feb. 2. Capital Business is The Post’s weekly publication focusing on the region’s business community.	39	"[{""start"": 378, ""end"": 598, ""text"": ""This year’s lineup includes one of the most diverse displays of green technology, including ­battery-powered electric engines, hybrids, clean diesel and hydrogen-fueled cars, said Washington Auto Show chair Kevin Reilly,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 162, ""end"": 250, ""text"": ""The car companies hope to highlight clean-tech alternatives to plug-in electric vehicles"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 787, ""end"": 1079, ""text"": ""i came to the show to feature its Tucson Fuel Cell ­crossover-utility vehicle, expected to reach the market at a few Hyundai dealers in Southern California this spring.

"Toyota raced into the future Monday, unveiling its first hydrogen-powered car and championing the technology at International CES. Physicist and futurist Michio Kaku was on hand to introduce the company's new fuel cell, which he said has a range of 300 miles and can refuel in three to five minutes. ""We are entering the age of hydrogen,"" Kaku said. ""We are present at the creation of a hydrogen society."" Toyota's first car using this technology is called the Mirai — the Japanese word for future. The car is due in the U.S. in the fall. It will cost around $50,000 and, the company said, Mirai's fuel cell can power a house for a week in case of an emergency. As it attempts to push the world toward a hydrogen-fueled future, Toyota said that it's also hoping to find some compatriots. It will also let anyone, particularly engineers and car manufacturers, use its approximately 5,680 fuel-cell related patents — including those used in the Mirai — for free, Toyota said in a statement. The car company says it will also build and fund the production of fueling stations, saying that it will first focus on creating that infrastructure in California and in the New York and New Jersey areas."	37	"[{""start"": 131, ""end"": 299, ""text"": ""Physicist and futurist Michio Kaku was on hand to introduce the company's new fuel cell, which he said has a range of 300 miles and can refuel in three to five minutes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 301, ""end"": 405, ""text"": ""We are entering the age of hydrogen,\"" Kaku said. \""We are present at the creation of a hydrogen society."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 590, ""end"": 660, ""text"": ""Mirai's fuel cell can power a house for a week in case of an emergency"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 989, ""end"": 1193, ""text"": ""The car company says it will also build and fund the production of fueling stations, saying that it will first focus on creating that infrastructure in California and in the New York and New Jersey areas."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 590, ""end"": 661, ""text"": ""Mirai's fuel cell can power a house for a week in case of an emergency."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 989, ""end"": 1072, ""text"": ""The car company says it will also build and fund the production of fueling stations"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	50	2023-03-16T11:11:09.054222Z	2023-03-16T11:11:09.054356Z	236.969
"The first thing you notice about Toyota's hydrogen fuel cell SUV is that you hardly feel like you're driving. It's more like you're floating. When the engine kicks in, you don't get the jolt that you do with a car that runs on gasoline. It's not even like a typical hybrid, which starts you off on battery power before handing you off to the fossil-fuel engine. Instead, the converted Highlander I drove to my dentist Friday morning was a hybrid of a different kind. A nickel-metal hydride battery still got the car moving from a standstill, but where an ordinary engine would sit under the hood, burning up dead dinosaurs, was an electric motor hooked up to four tanks holding 5 kilos of hydrogen gas. Unlike with ordinary cars, the fuel isn't burned. It's passed through a membrane that turns the hydrogen gas into water — a process that draws on outside air to create electricity for the engine. Fuel cell technology sounds like science fiction. But it's coming very soon to the mass market: Hyundai has plans to introduce a commercial fuel cell vehicle as early as this year, and Toyota will debut its hydrogen-powered car in 2015. I took the Highlander through the small, neighborhood streets of Northwest Washington, before dropping down into Rock Creek Park and opening up the throttle. In the tight spaces of Columbia Heights, the regenerative braking system seemed a little overeager, responding to a tap of the foot with more stopping power than I expected. Going up steep hills proved no problem, with the electric engine's steady hum providing a more genteel kind of feedback than a combustion engine's aggressive roar. Instead of a tachometer on the left side of the instrument panel, there's an electricity meter that tells you how much power you're drawing. It's a little hard to grasp, because unlike a typical engine, there's no optimal RPM range. Complementing that is a screen-based chart that tells you how efficient your energy usage is. This will be familiar to anyone who's driven an ordinary hybrid. Fuel economy obsessives will find lots to like about this car. On a full tank, the Highlander has a range of 300 or 400 miles, according to Chris Santucci, the Toyota engineer sitting in the passenger seat beside me. Filling up takes about five minutes — not much longer than your typical vehicle — but you can go much farther than even today's best hybrids. The Toyota Prius gets about 50 miles to the gallon; the Highlander gas-electric hybrid gets about 27 under optimal conditions. The hydrogen-based Highlander? Sixty miles per gallon. Of course, it doesn't matter how far you can go on a single tank if you have nowhere to refuel. As critics will point out, hydrogen vehicles are limited by the infrastructure that supports them. So far, California has been the most active in building hydrogen stations. There are nine available for public use right now around San Francisco and Los Angeles, with dozens more on the way. South Carolina is the only other state with a hydrogen refueling station, according to the Department of Energy. Building a station takes just $1 million-$2 million, according to Santucci. So that's no problem. It's the gas that's expensive. Even in the Los Angeles area, it's priced as high as $5 a kilogram. Much of the cost is linked to transporting and storing the stuff in liquid form; unless the distribution point is relatively close to the pipeline, you're going to have to pay through the nose. This is where the relative rarity of hydrogen cars — and their fuel economy — could become an advantage. Santucci told me that, at least at first, you might not even need all the infrastructure of a traditional gas station. ""Maybe you have a truck that has refueling nozzles on it, and you park it in one spot for a time,"" he said. ""Try a couple spots in Northwest D.C. one week, and move it to the suburbs the next."" Here's one other thing that's hard to ignore. The rise of hydrogen vehicles like Toyota's new Highlander — whose price has not been announced — is also taking place at a time when Americans' appetite for driving is on the wane. It's not clear how fuel-cell vehicles fit into this trend, precisely; they could become a kind of transitional technology in this period, easing us off cars more generally. Or if demand for driving picks up again, they might take a greater share of the market. Right now, though, the market share targets are very modest for hydrogen cars — around two-tenths of a percent for the foreseeable future, according to Santucci. ""Gasoline's going to be around for quite some time,"" he said."	36	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 108, ""text"": ""st thing you notice about Toyota's hydrogen fuel cell SUV is that you hardly feel like you're driving"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 108, ""end"": 360, ""text"": "".

PostTV’s Zoeann Murphy was on hand as Toyota demonstrated its hydrogen fuel cell-powered sedan at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Toyota on Monday announced plans to begin selling the cars in the United States in 2015, focusing first on California. The car, called FCV, will have a range of 300 miles and can go from zero to 60 mph in 10 seconds. Fueling the hydrogen tank will take three to five minutes, and one tank will last 300 miles. The vehicles will cost between $50,000-$100,000. Wonkblog’s Brad Plumer laid out the reasons for Toyota’s emphasis on hydrogen-fueled vehicles, even as many auto companies are betting on electric cars.

The first self-sufficient boat powered only by clean, emission-free energy — and not just the wind in its sails — will start a six-year trip around the world in the spring. Energy Observer, a former race boat now equipped with solar panels, wind turbines and hydrogen fuel cells, will use sun, wind and self-generated hydrogen to power batteries that run the boat’s electric motors. The $5.25 million boat is now in a French shipyard before heading to Paris for the first of 101 stops in 50 countries. Designed in 1983, the 100-foot boat had a successful career in open-sea sailing races. The Energy Observer project was dreamed up in 2015 by skippers Frédéric Dahirel and Victorien Erussard, with scuba diver and filmmaker Jérôme Delafosse also behind the project. “I’m passionate about new technologies,” Erussard said. “Building a self-sufficient boat could have seemed [unrealistic], but this is going to be an incredible vessel. It’s very promising for the future.” The boat converts seawater into hydrogen fuel using a chemical process called electrolysis (pronounced ee-leck-TRAWL-uh-sis). It is also equipped with a kite sail. “I believe that it is fantastic that a boat powered by hydrogen . . . will travel the world,” said Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University engineering professor who is working to help countries convert to 100 percent renewable energies by 2050. “It is an important step forward and consistent with this proposed path to 100 percent clean, renewable energy worldwide for all purposes to solve energy security, job creation, air pollution and climate problems.” — Associated Press	32	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 74, ""text"": ""st self-sufficient boat powered only by clean, emission-free energy"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 173, ""end"": 381, ""text"": ""Energy Observer, a former race boat now equipped with solar panels, wind turbines and hydrogen fuel cells, will use sun, wind and self-generated hydrogen to power batteries that run the boat’s electric motors"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 823, ""end"": 1096, ""text"": ""Building a self-sufficient boat could have seemed [unrealistic], but this is going to be an incredible vessel.

"The current conventional wisdom is that plug-in electric vehicles will be the clean, sleek cars of tomorrow. Think of Tesla's Model S or Chevrolet's Volt. These cars get most of the media attention, and policymakers tend to toss tax breaks their way. Not all automakers, however, are persuaded that plug-ins are the only way to go. This month, Honda, Toyota and Hyundai all announced plans to produce hydrogen fuel-cell passenger vehicles in the next few years. These cars will run on compressed hydrogen — and emit only water vapor as exhaust. For a long time, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles were seen as a tantalizing technology to help reduce society's dependency on oil. In theory, fuel-cell vehicles could charge in minutes and go for hundreds of miles before refueling — overcoming the disadvantages of plug-in electric cars with their bulky batteries and limited ranges. But the vehicles themselves were seen as forbiddingly expensive, and the challenges in setting up a hydrogen fueling infrastructure looked insurmountable. That explains why hydrogen lost its allure in the 2000s, particularly as batteries improved and electric vehicles became a reality. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy shifted its research and funding away from hydrogen and toward battery-driven electric cars. Now the pendulum may be swinging back. Plug-in electric cars aren't selling quite as well as their advocates once hoped. And the cost of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles seems to be dropping. Could hydrogen be in for a comeback? Or are the obstacles still too steep? Toyota's fuel-cell plans Toyota's emphasis on hydrogen is especially noteworthy. Sixteen years ago, the Japanese automaker was the first company to produce a commercially successful hybrid-electric car — the Prius, which features both a gasoline engine and an electric motor whose battery is charged by braking energy. That success led to a rising interest in electric cars. Yet unlike many companies, Toyota isn't focused on all-electric vehicle as the logical next step. ""The reason why Toyota doesn’t introduce any major [all-electric vehicles] is because we do not believe there is a market to accept it,” said Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada during a speech in Washington D.C. back in September. Uchiyamada argued that battery technology still needs a few major breakthroughs before all-electric vehicles can compete with hybrids or traditional gasoline-powered cars — the batteries are expensive, have limited range, and take hours to recharge fully. So, for now, Toyota will focus on improving its line of hybrids to meet rising fuel-economy standards in the United States. But the company is also betting on hydrogen. Toyota is promising a mass-produced fuel-cell vehicle in Japan by 2015 and one in the United States by 2016. The price? Between $50,000 and $100,000. That lower end is comparable to the cost of Toyota's Lexus sedans, and it's cheap enough that hydrogen vehicles could possibly have mass appeal  — particularly if gasoline prices ever start rising again. Other automakers agree that fuel-cell vehicle costs are falling dramatically. ""These things are now ready for prime time,” John Krafcik, Hyundai's North American CEO, recently told the Associated Press. But is that enough to edge out plug-ins? Fuel cells vs. plug-in vehicles Let's start with a rough breakdown of the two technologies: Plug-in electric vehicles are powered by batteries that are charged through outlets. Hydrogen fuel cells, by contrast, use a chemical process to separate out the electrons in molecules of hydrogen gas that, in turn, power the car's electric motor. The main advantages of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles: They can charge within minutes and have a longer range than plug-ins. Toyota estimates that its fuel-cell cars will travel 375 miles before refueling. That's a huge deal. Right now, some analysts think plug-in vehicles are being held back by the fact that they take awhile to charge and have limited range. What's more, the hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles themselves can be pollution-free. Oxygen is pumped into the system, and water and heat come out. So, what's the catch? For starters, there are very few hydrogen fueling stations around the country. And building out a network could prove difficult. One 2008 study by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that it could require $55 billion of public investment just to get two million hydrogen cars on U.S. roads by 2023. To be sure, plug-in charging stations aren't ubiquitous, either. But that's changing fast. As of 2012, there were 13,392 electric-charging stations around the country, compared with just 58 hydrogen stations. Plus, drivers can charge their plug-in vehicles in their garages. That's why Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn has questioned whether hydrogen cars will ever catch on. “Where is the infrastructure?"" he asked at the Tokyo Motor Show on Nov. 20. ""Who’s going to build it?” There are also potential environmental drawbacks to fuel cells, as the hydrogen fueling infrastructure requires a large amount of energy: The hydrogen gas first has to be split off from water, then transported to fueling stations, then condensed at high pressures, and then converted back into electricity inside the car. That's a relatively inefficient process In the near term, natural gas could be used to produce the hydrogen. If so, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has estimated that fuel-cell cars could produce more greenhouse-gas emissions than hybrid vehicles when you consider the entire life-cycle. (Though other studies disagree.) By contrast, plug-in electric vehicles tend to be more climate-friendly than conventional vehicles in most parts of the United States. Fuel cells might not be a truly 'green' technology until the world has a surplus of carbon-free energy to produce hydrogen — a prospect that's still some ways off. Could the technologies co-exist? Both vehicle technologies have their advocates and detractors. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has argued that there's ""no way"" fuel cell technology will ever prevail, citing cost and environmental concerns. Toyota's officials, however, argue that Tesla's success with electric vehicles is ""a rare case"" — and that the future lies elsewhere. But it's also possible that a variety of technologies could find their own particular niches in the decades ahead. More efficient gas-powered cars and hybrids could dominate as a ""bridge"" to the future, as Toyota's Uchiyamada has predicted. Meanwhile, battery costs could tumble, making plug-in electric cars more viable for short commutes. And hydrogen vehicles could catch on for long-haul trips. Right now, however, it's still unclear how this battle will shake out.

Dozens of the world’s largest automakers descended on the nation’s capital this week for the Washington Auto Show, offering a glance at the latest in automotive technologies — from hydrogen-powered vehicles to smartwatch-enabled ignitions — as well as those coming down the pipeline, such as self-driving cars. The event, which opens to the public on Friday, also presents a forum for those carmakers to convince policymakers that their respective innovations hold the keys to a more safe, efficient and environmentally friendly transportation future. “Because we have some of the most influential individuals coming by, these companies bring their very best to the show,” said Kevin Reilly, the event’s chairman. With roots tracing to 1920, the Washington Auto Show has emerged as the destination for carmakers to showcase their latest breakthroughs in eco-friendly and sustainable technology. Hydrogen-fueled vehicles, which emit only water out the tailpipe, are prominent at the show, which runs at the Washington Convention Center through Feb. 1. Toyota, which brought its hydrogen-powered sedan prototype to Washington last year, returned with the final version, named the Mirai. The Japanese carmaker has started taking orders for the car and plans to bring it to California dealerships toward the end of this year. Honda’s own hydrogen-fuel-cell concept vehicle, scheduled to be completed by next year,  is also on display at the show. Hoping to accelerate the infrastructure needed to support those vehicles, Toyota on Thursday announced a new partnership with state and local governments in Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts to help fund a network of hydrogen fuel stations in the Northeast. Nihar Patel, Toyota’s vice president of business strategy for North America, said his company plans to lobby newly elected officials in both the District and Maryland to help build a similar “starter network” in the Washington region. “There’s a propensity among people here to buy greener, cleaner vehicles,” Patel added. In addition to sustainability, this year’s show will very much be about connectivity. Hyundai will this year will be touting new smartphone apps that allow drivers to start their cars, turn up the air conditioning, and input music and navigation information directly from Apple and Android programs. “It’s no longer about features that are embedded in your car versus others that might be on your smartphone, but really the merging those two things two together,” Michael Deitz, Hyundai Senior Group Manager, said Thursday. During the media day, auto executives met with several federal officials, including Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and several officials from the Commerce Department, all of whom toured the exhibits on Thursday. Moniz, who delivered a keynote address for the second straight year, announced the start of a $56 million lending initiative intended to support private companies that have bold ideas about ways to build more sustainable vehicles — what he called “blue-sky ideas that will take us into the future.”	29	"[{""start"": 140, ""end"": 238, ""text"": ""latest in automotive technologies — from hydrogen-powered vehicles to smartwatch-enabled ignitions"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 311, ""end"": 550, ""text"": ""The event, which opens to the public on Friday, also presents a forum for those carmakers to convince policymakers that their respective innovations hold the keys to a more safe, efficient and environmentally friendly transportation future"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 391, ""end"": 425, ""text"": ""carmakers to convince policymakers"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 895, ""end"": 959, ""text"": ""Hydrogen-fueled vehicles, which emit only water out the tailpipe"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1322, ""end"": 1409, ""text"": ""Honda’s own hydrogen-fuel-cell concept vehicle, scheduled to be completed by next year,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2835, ""end"": 3059, ""text"": "", who delivered a keynote address for the second straight year, announced the start of a $56 million lending initiative intended to support private companies that have bold ideas about ways to build more sustainable vehicles"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1517, ""end"": 1732, ""text"": ""Toyota on Thursday announced a new partnership with state and local governments in Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts to help fund a network of hydrogen fuel stations in the Northeast."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	42	2023-03-14T15:52:49.708463Z	2023-03-14T15:52:49.708564Z	540.749
In the auto industry, it’s increasingly hip to be green. Question is, which company is the greenest? This week at the Washington Auto Show, Green Car Journal will announce the winner of its annual Green Car Technology Award, recognizing inventions that are making the vehicles we drive more efficient and environmentally friendly. For the first time, the publication will also hand out awards for a Luxury Green Car of the Year and Green SUV of the Yea, celebrating carmakers that have built sustainable vehicles in classes not historically known for offering eco-friendly options. For the Green Technology Award, the innovations earning high marks vary in terms of the type of cars they support, from those that run on hydrogen cells to plug-in electric motors to traditional combustion engines. It’s evidence that auto manufacturers have different views on which type of power systems are most likely to power the cars of tomorrow. Here’s a look at the finalists for the technology award, and below that, click through for a rundown of the nominees for the first-ever Green Luxury and Green SUV awards. Check back on Thursday to find out the winners. BMW i8 Plug-In Hybrid Powertrain The BMW i8 sports car has two separate powertrains. The front two wheels are powered by a 96-kilowatt electric motor while a turbocharged 231-horsepower gas engine situated near the rear powers the back two wheels. The two drive systems can be used either one-at-a-time or simultaneously – the latter option delivering maximum power. BMW i3 REx Range Extender BMW has generated plenty of buzz by giving buyers of the electric i3 the option to tack on a so-called range extender – a small, two-cylinder gas engine that powers a generator to add another 80-plus miles to the car’s roughly 90 miles of purely electric range. However, by adding a extra weight, that option will slightly reduce the car’s all-electric range compared to the non-ReX version. Chevrolet CNG Bi-Fuel Powertrain Included in Chevy’s 2015 Impala, the CNG Bi-Fuel powertrain allows the vehicle to run on either standard gasoline or what’s known as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), each of which has its own separate fuel tank. The cool thing about that CNG? It can be produced from processes that make use of organic waste materials such as table scraps and beer grains. Ford F-150 Aluminum Body Breaking quite literally from the mold, Ford has introduced a 2015 F-150 with a completely aluminum body, rather than using steel. The move shed 700 pounds from the steel-bodied version and therefore boosted the fuel economy. Critics worry the aluminum body won’t provide the durability needed for a pick-up, but Ford executives have insisted that won’t be a problem thanks to the use of thicker, heat-treated aluminum. Ford 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 Ford is taking full advantage of that weight-reduction in the F-150 by inserting the smallest engine ever in the truck’s 68-year history. However, small does not mean weak for the company’s new 2.7-liter Ecoboost engine. The Aluminum F-150’s EcoBoost V6 still delivers 325 horsepower. Honda 1.5-liter Earth Dreams Engine The engines used in Honda’s new Earth Dreams drive system bring improved fuel-efficiency and lower emissions through a combination of weight reductions, direct-injection technology and other enhancements. The new engines come in a half dozen different sizes and help vehicles like the Honda Fit eclipse 40 miles per gallon. Kia Soul Electric Powertrain A new rival to the Nissan Leaf and Ford Focus Electric, the electric version of the Soul arrived in California dealerships this winter and offers 93 miles on a single charge. The company manages to only slightly reduce the passenger and cargo space with the electric powertrain, which comes equipped with a Braking Mode that allows the vehicle to slow to a near halt while simultaneously recharging the battery. Tesla Dual Motor AWD Tesla made a splash this fall by introducing a dual-motor power system for its fleet of Model S sedans, with one motor powering the front wheels and the other powering the rear wheels. Previous models have had a single motor that powered only the back wheels. The additional motor will add both stability and speed to the company’s most popular vehicles. Volvo Drive-E Some were surprised when Volvo sped into the headlines in October sporting a new four-cylinder engine with not one, not two, but three turbochargers, delivering an impressive 450 horsepower. The turbos are fed compressed air from an electrically powered compressor in the vehicle, which then pumps additional oxygen into the engine, resulting in extra power. VW e-Golf Electric Powertrain Volkswagen’s e-Golf is the automaker’s first production electric vehicle to be sold in the United States, a milestone that coincides with the Golf’s 40th birthday. The e-Golf, which looks nearly identical to its gas-powered counterparts, features a plug-in electric powertrain that pushes it to a combined fuel efficiency of 116 miles per gallon-equivalent (MPGe).

D.C. is no Detroit, meaning the nation’s capital is not typically the place where new car models are unveiled. But being near the seat of power helps frame the Washington Auto Show, which runs through Sunday, as the best place to hash out the fine points of government policy. “We’ve had an unparalleled opportunity to construct a platform for the industry to get together and have critically important conversations about where we’re headed,” said Gerard Murphy, president of the Washington Area New Automobile Dealers Association, the auto show sponsor. “It’s an opportunity to vet a lot of what’s in the pipeline of lawmakers and regulators.” Before kicking off the 10-day show, organizers held two days’ worth of meetings with auto and government officials to discuss some of the issues at hand. Fuel economy standards Dealers and manufacturers are uneasy about the Obama administration’s proposal to raise fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon from 35.4 by 2025. Critics say the effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions could limit growth of new sales by making vehicles too expensive. “Automakers must continue to work with lawmakers to bring affordable advanced technology to the market,” said Michael Stanton, president and chief executive of Global Automakers, which represents 15 international auto manufacturers. “Our members are investing in the technologies to cut back on emissions, but the proposed standards don’t match the reality of the market.” While Stanton favors the long lead time built into the proposal, he said the government must assess the pace of technology advances, fuel costs and consumer acceptance at the halfway point of the deadline. The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Administration are holding hearings on the proposal, with the final rules anticipated to take effect by the end of this summer. Alternative fuel cars “We have to wean ourselves off our dependence of foreign oil and look for legitimate alternative fuel sources, whether its electricity, hydrogen cells or some combination of gas and electric,” said Robert Fogarty, chairman of the Washington Auto Show. Hybrids and electric cars continue to dominate the conversation around fuel efficiency, but panelists at the show’s policy summit, held last Wednesday at the Cannon Building on Capitol Hill, agreed that cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells deserved more government support. Stanton said the technology for fuel cells is “coming along rapidly,” but a vast network of refueling stations is needed. Storing the highly explosive hydrogen is a challenge, but one Stanton said could be overcome with the government working with industry on a solution. Toyota Motor North America’s Chief Communications Officer James Wiseman said the company expects to have a fuel-cell vehicle ready by 2015. “Currently there is no infrastructure for fuel cells, but we are all working on it,” he said. “But that is the trick with the government. The difficult part is picking where you make your investment.”	26	"[{""start"": 1127, ""end"": 1228, ""text"": ""Automakers must continue to work with lawmakers to bring affordable advanced technology to the market"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1359, ""end"": 1430, ""text"": ""“Our members are investing in the technologies to cut back on emissions"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1925, ""end"": 2116, ""text"": ""We have to wean ourselves off our dependence of foreign oil and look for legitimate alternative fuel sources, whether its electricity, hydrogen cells or some combination of gas and electric,”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2379, ""end"": 2448, ""text"": ""cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells deserved more government support."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2429, ""end"": 2448, ""text"": ""government support."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	39	2023-03-14T13:01:50.469011Z	2023-03-14T13:01:50.469159Z	571.53
"Toyota this week officially rolled out what it's betting will mark ""a turning point"" in automotive history — a sleek, affordable, eco-friendly ""future"" car that can drive for 300 miles, takes less than five minutes to refuel and comes with three years of free gas. It's everything critics of gas-guzzling car culture could love. And the biggest name in electric cars hates it. Toyota's Mirai (meaning ""future"" in Japanese) will be one of the first mass-market cars to run on hydrogen fuel cells, which convert compressed hydrogen gas to electricity, leaving water vapor as the only exhaust. As opposed to getting plugged in overnight, the sedan will need only about three minutes to get back to full charge, a huge boon for convincing the world's drivers to convert to a cleaner ride. But the green technology has found a surprisingly forceful critic in Elon Musk, the electric-car pioneer and founder of Tesla Motors, maker of battery-powered cars like the Model S. Musk has called hydrogen fuel cells ""extremely silly"" and ""fool cells,"" with his main critique being that hydrogen is too difficult to produce, store and turn efficiently to fuel, diverting attention from even better sources of clean energy. ""If you're going to pick an energy source mechanism, hydrogen is an incredibly dumb one to pick,"" Musk said last month in Detroit. ""The best-case hydrogen fuel cell doesn't win against the current-case batteries. It doesn't make sense, and that will become apparent in the next few years."" But Toyota, one of Big Auto's few pioneers of fuel-efficient cars like the Prius hybrid, has not been content to let Musk's aggression stand. Bob Carter, a Toyota senior vice president, slapped back at Musk last month by criticizing his sole focus on battery-powered cars: ""If I was in a position where I had all my eggs in one basket, I would perhaps be making those same comments."" The electric-car infighting has opened up a huge division over the future of zero-emission cars. Although they make little sense anywhere else now but California, home of the nation's few hydrogen refueling stations, Toyota and its home country of Japan are investing heavily into ushering in what Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called the world's ""hydrogen era."" The Mirai is an absolute oddity even in the world's still-small green car market. A dozen workers in blue hard hats will hand-craft the cars without help of conveyor belt, turning out only three a day, Toyota said. The small-batch operation will roll out 700 this year for the U.S., Japan, Europe, and crank up to 2,000 starting next year. Toyota plans to sell the Mirai for about $45,000 in the U.S., including about $13,000 in federal and California incentives, starting next year. It will sell to the public in Japan next month. At 300 miles, the four-seat Mirai offers the longest range of any electric vehicle on the market (and more than Tesla's $80,000 Model S, which gets 265 miles). A full tank of hydrogen, Toyota adds, has enough energy to power the average American home for a week. But hydrogen fuel cells carry their own challenges. To sell successfully in America, the cars will need a nationwide infrastructure for refueling (a problem Musk has sought to get around through Tesla's national network of ""superchargers."") Though its emissions are greener, hydrogen is now mostly sourced from natural gas, which carries its own environmental impacts. But Toyota has been strong in its defense of hydrogen, saying it will give drivers far quicker refueling times and farther range than the typical battery-powered electric car. Toyota is not the only automaker pushing hard on fuel cells: The hydrogen-powered Hyundai Tucson is now available in California, and Honda's fuel-cell car is expected to roll out next year. But Toyota has been one of its biggest boosters, opening its more than 5,000 fuel-cell related patents up for free and saying it wants to build and fund new fueling stations, first in California and then stretching to the east coast. California is investing tens of millions of dollars to build 28 new hydrogen refueling stations, on top of the 10 it was home to as of last year. Japan has proven to be far more embracing of the ""hydrogen society,"" investing in self-service hydrogen stations, easing fuel-cell regulations and offering about 3 million yen (about $25,200) in incentives to early Mirai buyers. Prime Minister Abe, one of the first to receive a Mirai, said he wants all of Japan's agencies to have one, too. Although Mirai production began in December, Toyota's president, Akio Toyoda, marked Tuesday as the official roll-out date. Five years ago to the day, a congressional panel grilled Toyoda about the automaker's recalls for unintended acceleration programs, a long embarrassment for the major Japanese brand. “For us, that date marks a new start,” Toyoda said. “This is not to reflect on the past, but rather to celebrate Toyota’s new start, where we take a fresh step towards the future.” More from The Washington Post: The hidden dangers of Lincoln Town Cars, America’s favorite taxi cab Worse than salt, brine sprayed on roads will munch your car to pieces Have a question about the auto industry or need purchasing advice?

Bill Gates thinks it may take a miracle to find the kind of cheap, clean energy source needed to safely power the planet through the next century. But he believes governments and businesses aren’t doing nearly enough to discover one. In a letter issued by his foundation on Tuesday, the billionaire philanthropist repeated his plea for a financial call to arms in energy research, saying massive investments are needed to find and develop new technology that can fuel the world’s economy without poisoning its inhabitants. “The challenge we face is big, perhaps bigger than many people imagine. But so is the opportunity,” Gates writes in an annual missive posted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “If the world can find a source of cheap, clean energy, it will do more than halt climate change. It will transform the lives of millions of the poorest families.” The appeal for a global surge in basic research comes three months after Gates announced the creation of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a private investment initiative that includes 28 of the world’s richest private investors. The group, whose members include Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, with a collective worth estimated at $350 billion, pledged to funnel billions of dollars into efforts to develop new sources of energy and energy storage. A parallel effort announced by the United States, China and 17 other countries seeks to double government spending on energy research and development in the next five years. Gates, in an interview, said the private initiative will be expanded later this year to include institutional investors such as university endowments and corporations. And still, he says, he worries that the effort so far is not equal to the challenge the planet faces in the coming decades. Even if all countries honor carbon-cutting commitments made in December’s historic climate agreement in Paris, global temperatures are projected to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. “In short, we need an energy miracle,” Gates writes in the letter. “When I say ‘miracle,’ I don’t mean something that’s impossible. I’ve seen miracles happen before. The personal computer. The Internet. The polio vaccine. None of them happened by chance. They are the result of research and development and the human capacity to innovate. “In this case, however, time is not on our side,” he says. Gates said he was encouraged by the dramatic growth in solar and wind energy around the world, but he said new technology is needed to solve the “intermittency” problem — how to make electricity when the wind is still and the sun isn’t shining — and to find cost-effective ways to store energy. Moreover, developing countries urgently need cheap alternatives to fossil fuels that will allow them to provide electricity to billions of their citizens without increasing air pollution or contributing to climate change. “We need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas — even ones that might sound a little crazy — if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century,” he said. Gates applauded the Obama administration’s decision to lead the 19-nation Mission Innovation initiative to increase government spending on basic R&D. But he said energy research should be a bipartisan issue for the United States, despite partisan differences over climate change. “Innovation has always been a mix of government funding and private-sector risk taking, and you really want to activate both,” Gates told The Washington Post. “What we haven’t seen [in the United States] is an increase in energy R&D — it’s stayed at basically the same level since [former President Ronald] Reagan. “We need the United States to set a good example,” he said, “because the best energy R&D institutions are here — the national labs, the top universities and a startup culture that allows technology to come out of the labs and into the private sector.” More at Energy & Environment: The solution to climate change that has nothing to do with cars or coal We may have just seen a truly ominous new weather record It’s not just Flint: Poor communities across the U.S. live with ‘extreme’ polluters For more, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here, and follow us on Twitter here.	24	"[{""start"": 388, ""end"": 522, ""text"": ""massive investments are needed to find and develop new technology that can fuel the world’s economy without poisoning its inhabitants."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2751, ""end"": 2971, ""text"": ""Moreover, developing countries urgently need cheap alternatives to fossil fuels that will allow them to provide electricity to billions of their citizens without increasing air pollution or contributing to climate change"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	37	2023-03-14T12:39:44.073617Z	2023-03-14T12:39:44.073675Z	341.093
It sounds like science fiction — a car that runs on hydrogen gas, spits nothing but water vapor out the tailpipe, and can take you from Washington to New York City on a single tank. But after a long and bumpy road from futuristic concept car to real-world production vehicle, the first mass-produced hydrogen-powered cars will hit dealerships this spring in the United States, and they are on display this week at the Washington Auto Show. How soon you’ll see them on the roads in our region remains to be seen, as auto manufacturers, fueling companies and policymakers look for ways to tackle serious challenges that now stand in the way — not the least of which is where do you refuel with hydrogen. “It’s coming, this is the next wave, and from what some of the manufacturers are saying, it’s an even better bet than some of the alternatives already on the market,” said Kevin Reilly, owner of Alexandria Hyundai and chairman of the Washington Auto Show. “Now all we need is the infrastructure to make it a viable option for drivers.” What are the advantages? Manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda and Hyundai — the latter of which will soon begin selling its first hydrogen-powered vehicle in parts of California where fueling stations already exist — say this new propulsion system tackles the age-old pollution problems of standard gasoline engines without many of the limitations that have held back the market for battery-powered and other alternative fuel vehicles. On board the vehicles, hydrogen and oxygen are combined in a fuel cell, causing a chemical reaction that yields electricity to power the car. The only other byproduct is water, which comes out the tailpipe as steam — so, no greenhouse gases, just like the plug-in hybrids and electric cars already on the road today. And while some processes used to extract hydrogen for fuel usage do emit greenhouse gases, research has shown that the overall “well-to-wheel” carbon footprint is lower for hydrogen-powered cars than for electric plug-ins and other alternative fuel vehicles. Meanwhile, filling up at a hydrogen pump takes a few minutes, compared to several hours for even the fastest of electric charging stations. And fuel cells can be scaled to power trucks and sport utility vehicles, whereas experts say it is currently difficult to stack enough batteries to power cars much larger than a sedan. Most importantly, though, hydrogen-powered cars can travel upwards of 300 miles on one tank, giving consumers the same range they have grown accustomed to with gas engines. Conversely, the market for plug-ins continues to be limited by the fact that all but the most expensive models can travel no more than 100 miles on a full charge. Indeed, as the area’s network of electric charging stations has become more dense, electric vehicle sales in the Washington region have ticked up from around 150 last year to more than 600 in the past 11 months, according to data from the Washington Area New Auto Dealers Association. Still, that represents less than half of 1 percent of all cars sold in the region during that period. “Drivers want larger cars, especially here in the United States, and they want to be able to drive further without refueling,” Mike O’Brien, Hyundai’s vice president of corporate and product planning, said in an interview. “So while we think there will always be a place for battery-powered electrics in our fleet, they’ll always be supplemental vehicles, not ones that can displace combustion engines.” How did we get here? With so many advantages to hydrogen, why are we so much further down the road on an electric charging network than we are on hydrogen fueling stations? It comes down to federal funding and the current administration’s evolving stance on hydrogen. During his first few years in office, then- Energy Secretary Steven Chu openly questioned the viability of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, at one point stating that it would require several “miracles” to make that dream a reality, including better ways to produce and store hydrogen and more affordable fuel cells. Under his watch, the Energy Department cut by more than half its funding for fuel cell research, while at the same time pouring additional resources into cultivating an infrastructure of electric charging stations for plug-in vehicles. Not long afterward, Shell closed the only commercial hydrogen station in the District, located on Benning Road, along with another three pilots it had been built in New York. On the East Coast, it looked like the end of the road for hydrogen cars. Only three years later, though, Chu acknowledged that he had changed his mind about hydrogen, pointing to new techniques developed to extract hydrogen from natural gas as well as improvements and cost reductions in automotive technology. Toyota executives, for instance, say they have reduced the cost of hydrogen vehicles by 95 percent in the past decade, mostly by bringing down the size of the fuel cells and by finding new, less expensive materials with which to build the tanks. At that point, though, the United States had already fallen behind the likes of Japan, Germany, Sweden, South Korea and the United Kingdom, all of which have made considerable government investments in hydrogen infrastructure and already have dense refueling networks. Now in catch-up mode, and now under the watch of Obama’s second-term Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, the United States has started to invest more money back into hydrogen. In May, the agency launched H2USA, a public-private collaboration between fuel suppliers, automakers, government agencies and clean technology groups to coordinate research and map out a plan for a hydrogen infrastructure. “It’s not the kind of problem the federal government is going to solve on its own, or that state governments or the industry are going to solve on their own; it really needs a team effort,” David Danielson, head of the department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, said at the auto show last week. He added that H2USA members will put forth several recommendations for the agency and other stakeholders in the next few months. Moniz, who also spoke at the show, said the department is taking a close look at steps that have been taken at the state level in California, where, sparked by public investments under former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and accelerated by legislation signed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D), a cluster of nine hydrogen stations have sprouted around Los Angeles. Over the next decade, the state will invest an additional $200 million to reach 100 stations by 2024. Money for the program comes from vehicle registration fees, meaning drivers are footing much of the bill for the infrastructure. Some private stakeholders, such as Toyota, which is planning on bringing its first hydrogen-powered car to the United States starting next year, have taken steps to speed up the process. The company partnered with the University of California, Irvine to fund research to determine how far apart to build hydrogen stations to make refueling practical for the largest number of potential buyers. If they want to sell the cars on the East Coast, some say carmakers will need to make those same investments here. “The first companies to sell a hydrogen fuel cell car are going to have to do some work like Nissan did with the Leaf,” said Joe Taylor, training director at Darcars Automotive Group, a privately owned collection of more than 20 local dealerships. “That was the first mass-produced all-electric car, and before they did it, they worked with other groups to help build the start of an infrastructure and put charging stations in some of their dealerships.” While automakers say they are willing to invest in research, they are unlikely to dive much further into the fuel production and gas station business, even if it means waiting longer for the infrastructure they need to start selling hydrogen cars in new markets. Who would have to step up? Instead, the onus will likely fall on existing hydrogen producers, technology firms and other investors. A small Connecticut-based company called SunHydro, for example, has started planting the first seeds in the Northeast, building its first hydrogen fueling station in central Connecticut in 2010 and recently starting construction on another just outside of Boston. Hydrogen is generated on site at both stations using energy from solar panels on the roof to electrolyze water. Purchased a few years ago by Tom Sullivan, who made his fortune with Toano, Va.-based hardwood flooring company Lumber Liquidators, SunHydro initially planned to build a chain of stations that would allow hydrogen cars to travel from Maine to Miami. However, Sullivan said he later realized that building a central hub of stations was a more practical path for hydrogen cars, and he hopes to start with a dense network around Boston. Once in place, if hydrogen cars start selling in the Northeast, the network would likely sprout satellite stations that he thinks would spread quickly to New York, and then down to Washington. In order for hydrogen cars to be a real option in this area, though, Sullivan estimates we would need at least a dozen stations in the region. And without cars to fill up at his existing pumps up north, he says there is little incentive to move forward, as each station costs a couple million dollars to build and needs roughly 100 vehicles locally to make it economically viable. “We need more cars to make it worthwhile, that’s the bottom line,” he said. Meanwhile, Hyundai, Toyota and Honda representatives all say they are eager to bring their cars to market on this side of the country — just as soon as they see hydrogen stations sprout on the East Coast. It leaves both sides at a stalemate, waiting for the other to jump first. Some are hoping that’s where the H2USA partnership will step in with funding or other incentives to get the early stages of a fueling network off the ground. “In California, they provided a walking bridge across the river for investors during this period where there are not yet enough hydrogen cars on the road,” O’Brien said. “It would be great to see that model expanded or duplicated at the state or federal level.” When will this all happen? With a little more push from elected officials, carmakers and fuel producers say they could have hydrogen-powered vehicles rolling out of dealerships in this region in as little as three or four years. “It’s not going to happen overnight, but it will happen,” Sullivan said. “I think, realistically, we are a few years away from seeing hydrogen-powered cars in this region.” Others think it will take significantly longer, some pointing out that it took about a decade to build an adequate recharging infrastructure here to support battery-powered electrics — a far less expensive undertaking than building hydrogen stations. “It could happen, but it’s going to take a long time and a large investment,” Eric Wachsman, director of the Energy Research Center at the University of Maryland, said in an interview. He added that hydrogen vehicles may prove more practical down the road for public buses and shipping fleets, which always return to the same location. However, “having hydrogen replace gas pumps at every corner station, that’s a long way out,” he added. Some local dealers were equally skeptical. Alex Perdikis, general manager of Koons Ford Lincoln Mazda in Silver Spring, said, “We don’t hear a lot of people asking or talking about hydrogen fuel.” Then again, that’s precisely why they are on display at the show, Reilly said. “In part, they’re shown because [automakers] want consumers here to get excited about these cars,” the auto show chairman said. “And second, they want lawmakers and agency officials walking around to see that this is no longer something automakers are thinking about doing, it’s here and it’s ready to roll out.” Ultimately, he said, the idea “is to get them to see what’s happening in California and get them thinking: ‘Alright, what do we need to do to get these vehicles on the road here and across the country?’” Follow J.D.

DETROIT — No sign of economic strife mars the dazzling floors of the North American International Auto Show, where Vice President Biden is expected to lead a contingent of Obama administration officials Wednesday and Thursday in what amounts to a victory lap. The U.S. automobile industry was on the brink of collapse before the administration invested $80 billion to prop it up in the face of widespread opposition. Now the vast majority of bailout money has been recouped and car companies are thriving. But if Washington saved the domestic auto business, it has yet to transform it into the small-car-producing, super-fuel-efficient industry that President Obama and other officials frequently described during the height of the crisis. As vehicle sales have risen sharply in the past four years, so, too, has consumer desire for bigger, better-performing cars. A combination of tightening government fuel standards and engineering breakthroughs has made it possible for new cars to achieve the best gas mileage in history. But many buyers are turning their backs on the most efficient models and technologies. Sales of gasoline-electric hybrids, though steadily improving, remain low. Dealers are struggling to move plug-in electric vehicles such as the Chev­rolet Volt and Nissan Leaf, despite generous incentives and a $7,500-per-vehicle federal tax credit. Administration officials have acknowledged that Obama’s goal, laid out in his 2011 State of the Union address, of having 1 million electric cars on the nation’s roads by 2015 was wildly optimistic. Automakers, including Detroit’s Big Three — Ford, General Motors and Chrysler — had a banner year in 2013, with sales up nearly 8 percent, to 15.6 million, close to pre-recession levels. Sales are projected to be even better in 2014. But contrary to the vision of the auto industry that administration officials conveyed during the bailout, the biggest gainers last year were some of the biggest vehicles: SUVs, luxury cars, pickup trucks and crossovers, according to Kelley Blue Book, which compiles copious data on the auto industry. Overall, cars are a bit heavier and their average horsepower has increased 4 percent since 2007, which analysts said reflects Americans’ hunger for vehicles that satisfy the soul as well as the mind. “Americans are Americans,” said Stephen D. Lind, Kelley Blue Book’s vice president of operations. “They love big trucks and they love their cars.” Americans’ love affair with larger cars is continuing despite tightening fuel-efficiency standards. Last year, new cars averaged 24.6 miles per gallon — a figure that will have to increase every year before topping out at a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 to comply with federal fuel-economy regulations. The implication would seem to be that cars are going to have to get much smaller and that many more consumers would be all but forced to buy electric or hybrid vehicles. But the mileage standards are not that straightforward, and that reality might come later than some think. Rather than guaranteeing a particular level of fuel economy, the standards instead peg efficiency targets to a vehicle’s size. That leaves larger cars and auto companies that sell more big cars with lower mileage targets. Some researchers have argued that the policy has created an unintended incentive for automakers to increase the average size of their vehicles. But automakers can sell only what consumers will buy. And bigger, more luxurious and more powerful cars are more than holding their own. “The big question is: What will consumers do?” said Katie Whitefoot, a senior program officer at the National Academy of Engineering who co-wrote a study on the unintended impact of the fuel-efficiency standards while she was at the University of Michigan. The glittering display of new cars filling the main exhibition hall at the Cobo Center here includes a fair share of ultra-high-mileage vehicles. There are small electric cars, vehicles with lightweight carbon-fiber bodies, hybrid sedans that get 50 miles a gallon and even an extended-range electric pickup truck by Via Motors powered in part by solar panels embedded in its cargo-bed cover. But the emphasis this year has been on performance and luxury. At the start of the media preview for the show Monday, a line of Corvettes roared up to the front of the exhibition halls, turning heads all the way. The display of power heralded the unveiling of Chevrolet’s Corvette Z06, which has a 625-horsepower engine and can hit 200 mph. “That is an insane level of performance,” said Alec Gutier­rez, senior market analyst at Kelley Blue Book. Germany’s BMW debuted three cars, including an M3 sedan that puts out 425 horsepower and can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The new BMWs and the 2015 Corvette might be only for a select few, but they are being introduced one year after sales of luxury sports cars grew by 28 percent. Recently, car buyers have been indulging their need for speed and luxury without too much pain because of relatively stable gasoline prices, projected to continue in 2014. There also has been a wider deployment of smarter and more efficient engine and transmission systems that save gasoline and ramp up performance, offering more power and better gas mileage. Still, some analysts say the future of the auto industry remains lighter vehicles and super-efficient engines, whether they are powered by gasoline, electricity or something else. But the question remains: When will that future arrive? “So far we have had evolutionary change,” said Andrew Smart, a director with the Society of Automotive Engineers, adding that soon fuel requirements will require “revolutionary change.”	22	"[{""start"": 506, ""end"": 738, ""text"": ""But if Washington saved the domestic auto business, it has yet to transform it into the small-car-producing, super-fuel-efficient industry that President Obama and other officials frequently described during the height of the crisis"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 740, ""end"": 863, ""text"": ""As vehicle sales have risen sharply in the past four years, so, too, has consumer desire for bigger, better-performing cars"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1031, ""end"": 1112, ""text"": ""many buyers are turning their backs on the most efficient models and technologies"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2235, ""end"": 2296, ""text"": ""hunger for vehicles that satisfy the soul as well as the mind"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2545, ""end"": 2934, ""text"": ""Last year, new cars averaged 24.6 miles per gallon — a figure that will have to increase every year before topping out at a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 to comply with federal fuel-economy regulations.

Think about an eco-friendly car, and an image of a small hybrid or electric sedan probably comes to mind – perhaps something along the lines of a Toyota Prius or a Chevrolet Volt. Luxury vehicle? Doubt it. Sport utility vehicle? Not likely. Some automakers are trying to change that perception. This week at the Washington Auto Show, Green Car Journal will hand out hardware not only for its annual Green Car Technology Award, but for the first time, two additional awards for a Luxury Green Car of the Year and Green SUV of the Year. The expansion of the awards program comes in response to heightened efforts by carmakers to make more sustainable vehicles available in all shapes and sizes, according to the publication. “Automakers are stepping up to meet the challenge of offering increasingly efficient, environmentally positive vehicles in all classes of vehicles,” Ron Cogan, Green Car Journal’s editor and publisher, said in a statement announcing the finalists. Here’s a look at the potential recipients for each new award. Don’t forget to check back for the winners on Thursday.

Tesla Motors’ billionaire chief executive Elon Musk walked into the enemy territory of Detroit this week with the electric-car maker quickly losing charge. Chevrolet’s all-electric Bolt, which some called a “Tesla killer,” promised a mass-market rollout matching what Tesla’s future cars would offer and cost. And, analysts warn, record-low gas prices threatened to deflate the electric-car market altogether. But in his first public appearance in Motor City in two years, the face of America’s electric-car movement doubled down on his promise to revolutionize the auto industry, pledging to make millions of electric-cars a year by 2025 — up from goals of about 33,000 last year. And about all those high-powered rivals at the door? They should, he said, invest even more toward electric cars. In other words: Bring it on. Musk has long criticized his compatriots in the auto world for their sluggishness in developing battery-powered cars en masse. That criticism, and many others, have made Musk the man the auto establishment loves to hate, the ultimate outsider in a car-making capital of insiders who think he’s overhyped or hate his guts. Now that automakers are starting to push back with designs that could give Tesla a run for its money, the South African-born firebrand isn’t backing down. In fact, Musk is chalking it up as a new victory for his mission to accelerate the advent of electric cars and, as he said, “make a difference in the world.” “It’s sort of counterintuitive, because, why do we want all these competitors?” said Musk, 43, during a Tuesday appearance at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit. But he reiterated the real environmental benefits will only happen “if the big car companies make risky decisions to make electric vehicles. I hope they do. We’ll try to be as helpful as we can.” Musk became the man to watch for having built the first new American automaker in years from the ground up. No executive at the North American International Auto Show this week in Detroit won as intense a spotlight, or polarized as many, as Musk — even though Tesla remains a relatively small player in the auto world, with only one car for sale and other models hit by long delays. (“I do have an issue with punctuality,” he said.) Musk’s goal to seize a large part of the auto market has put him at odds with the industry’s competitive traditionalists. On Tuesday, Musk pledged that Tesla would sell “a few million cars” by 2025, making it the size of BMW now. That seems optimistic, considering Tesla’s hold on the electric-car market lost some sparkle this week with other automakers’ electric unveilings. The Chevy Bolt and new Nissan Leaf, set for 2017, promise 200 miles on a single charge, for cheap: The Bolt is set to cost $38,000 before tax credits. And if that won’t hurt his goals, gas prices will. Oil dropped this week to below $45 a barrel, the lowest in more than five years. Musk said gas prices would be low for “a long time,” which could hurt electric cars’ adoption by some price-conscious drivers. But he said there would still be a “huge societal pressure,” amid a host of environmental benefits, pushing drivers away from fossil fuels. Electric cars, he added, would still be cheaper to run than gas-powered cars even with today’s bottom-barrel gas prices. And in the more than 30 other countries where Tesla sells and gas is pricier, the change in fuel prices will make even less of a dent in demand. If all this sounds like eco-friendly hooey, remember that Musk has long pushed for automakers and energy giants to do something in the face of climate change. Last year — after having pioneered faster chargers, safer batteries and a heap of other electric-car innovations — Tesla opened its hundreds of patents for all the automotive world to use, free of charge, as a way to spur automakers to improve. As for rivals’ electric car lines, he said he didn’t see them as a “competitive threat, because I think all cars will go electric,” Musk said. “There are 100 million new cars made every year. So what does it matter if someone makes a few hundred thousand additional electric cars? It’s not going to affect us, really.” For all its hype, it’s easy to forget that Tesla sells one car, made at one factory: the Model S, an all-electric sedan that sells for more than $70,000. Valued at about $25 billion, Tesla is less than half the size of GM or Ford. But seven years after the automaker sold its first Tesla roadster, Musk said the automaker still struggles to make enough cars to meet demand — even without spending a cent on advertising. Tesla’s giant rivals can’t help but take notice. In an earnings call last year, Ford chief executive Mark Fields even said of Tesla’s star car, “We have driven the Model S, torn it down, put it back together, and driven it again. We’re very familiar with that product.” Asked Tuesday whether he intended to do the same with his new competitors, or whether he found anything he wanted to emulate, Musk issued a laughably terse, “No.” Tesla’s market-watchers have sounded the alarms amid some recent sour notes. The automaker’s stock has slid more than 25 percent since peaking in September, on the back of the emergence of other electric-car competitors and lower gas prices. Though Tesla’s revenue grew in the first nine months of 2014 to more than $2.2 billion, a 60 percent boom from the year before, the automaker has never secured a yearly profit. But with his signature swagger, Musk brushed off investor worries, calling short-term stock shifts “not important” and pledging that the company would be profitable by 2020. A slowdown in China that spooked investors, Musk added, was due to a misperception among Chinese city-dwellers over the difficulty of charging the cars. Musk, who is also chief executive of space-travel firm SpaceX and co-founder of online payments service PayPal, said he intends to stay at Tesla “as long as I’m alive” — without any fears a potential “Tesla killer” would do him in. “Some degree of success is assured,” Musk said. It’s only, he added, “a question of magnitude.”	20	"[{""start"": 4476, ""end"": 4550, ""text"": ""Musk said the automaker still struggles to make enough cars to meet demand"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 330, ""end"": 409, ""text"": ""record-low gas prices threatened to deflate the electric-car market altogether."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2077, ""end"": 2210, ""text"": ""even though Tesla remains a relatively small player in the auto world, with only one car for sale and other models hit by long delays"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3049, ""end"": 3188, ""text"": ""But he said there would still be a “huge societal pressure,” amid a host of environmental benefits, pushing drivers away from fossil fuels."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3189, ""end"": 3308, ""text"": ""c cars, he added, would still be cheaper to run than gas-powered cars even with today’s bottom-barrel gas prices"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3214, ""end"": 3308, ""text"": ""would still be cheaper to run than gas-powered cars even with today’s bottom-barrel gas prices"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	33	2023-03-14T11:49:05.257404Z	2023-03-14T11:54:24.383867Z	223.59099999999998
People interested in environmental issues love a good game of this vs. that. Which is better for the environment: Paper towels or hot-air hand dryers? Cash, check or credit? Going to the theater or renting a DVD? While it’s an interesting diversion, such cases are all cocktail party chatter compared with whether, how much and what you choose to drive. One-fifth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, according to the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund. Environmental impact is just one of many considerations when buying a car. Quality and price — both of the car and, these days, of gasoline — come into play. Green cars are currently struggling to be price-competitive, leading GM recently to put a production hold on the highly publicized Volt. But if what if you wanted to base your choice on environmental merits alone? The biggest decision then is what sort of engine to buy. The traditional and still most common choice, the gasoline engine, is unsupported by an electric battery of any kind. Then there are hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius, Honda Insight and Ford Fusion, which use gasoline to power the car but can capture the gas engine’s surplus energy as electricity to charge a battery. There are also plug-in hybrids, which add the ability to charge the battery from an electrical socket while maintaining a gasoline backup. The Chevrolet Volt has grabbed headlines in this category and was the co-winner of the car of the year at this year’s Geneva Auto Show. Finally, there are such pure plug-in automobiles as the Nissan Leaf. No gas, just a rechargeable electric battery. Unfortunately, neither manufacturers nor the government has done much to help environmentally conscious car-buyers choose among these options. Stickers on the windows of new cars at dealerships — these signs are known in the industry as “Monroney stickers,” after the Oklahoma senator who decades ago proposed the law that mandated them — only tell you each car’s fuel efficiency during operation. As readers of this space already know, that’s just one factor in a product’s overall environmental impact. Other considerations include the energy required to extract the vehicle’s raw materials, the land taken up by the mines and factories, the energy used to transport the raw materials and the newly assembled car from place to place, the actual manufacturing of the product, the disposal of the car at the end of its useful life and the infrastructure required to support the vehicle (gas stations, charging stations, etc.). You’re probably expecting an answer here: All things considered, are the new engines environmentally superior? Unfortunately, the answer is “It depends.” But there are some factors to consider when making this decision. Jeremy Michalek, a professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, published a study on the relative impacts of these categories last year. He found that a variety of factors affect a car’s overall environmental impact. Some have to do with location, some with consumer behavior and some with manufacturing decisions beyond your control. Consider, for example, what kind of fuel powers the car. There’s no question that 100-percent electric vehicles have lower tailpipe emissions, because no fossil fuels are combusted during use. Total greenhouse gas emissions, however, are a different story. The electricity that runs a plug-in car has to come from somewhere. Coal is the most common source of electricity in the United States, and it emits 27 percent more carbon dioxide than oil, per unit of energy produced, by some calculations. So, according to Michalek, your best environmental choice depends on your location: “Consumers in Seattle obtain much of their electricity from hydroelectric power, so a battery electric vehicle that uses no gasoline will be at its best. Consumers in West Virginia obtain much of their electricity from coal, so a regular gasoline-powered hybrid electric vehicle like the Toyota Prius is better.” The Washington metropolitan area gets a large portion of its energy from coal — inspiring a lively debate about sustainability in the Post — but even that fact doesn’t end the conversation. “The time of day that the consumer plugs in matters, because at a certain time of day the power plant that would respond to the increased demand might be a coal plant even if average electricity in the region comes from cleaner sources,” says Michalek. While there’s no definitively “best” car type, Michalek’s study did make some points of general application. The life cycle environmental impact of a hybrid or pure plug-in car is largely influenced by the size of its batteries. Large batteries store more energy and extend a car’s range, but they come with an environmental cost. They’re heavy, require more extensive manufacturing resources and have to be replaced if they don’t outlive the rest of the car — which they often don’t. Disposal of the batteries is also resource-intensive, because they must be disassembled carefully rather than tossed into a landfill. Based on the average consumer’s energy mix and driving patterns, Michalek found that the pure plug-in cars, with large, long-range batteries, were no better for the environment than conventional gasoline cars. Hybrid engines with smaller batteries, however, are better than conventional vehicles and pure plug-ins. Does this mean we should abandon plug-in all-electric cars? Not necessarily. Michalek’s study found that there is a conceivable future in which the plug-in car would be the best choice. But a lot of pieces would have to fall into place, such as expanding renewable energy use in the electricity grid and figuring out how to extend the life of the batteries.
