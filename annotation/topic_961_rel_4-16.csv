To fall in love with a panda, according to those who know, you have to get to know it as an individual. “You don’t just look at them and say, ‘Okay, I’ve seen a panda,’ ” said Elspeth Grindlay, a diminutive woman who arrived at the National Zoo at 8 a.m. Monday in a panda T-shirt, with panda pendants around her neck. Rather, it is through hours of watching it lumber about, chew on bamboo and expose its furry tummy that you come to understand its spirit. That is why Grindlay has flown to Washington from Ayr, Scotland, five times in the past year alone, and why this visit was the most bittersweet. Bao Bao, the panda she and countless others fell in love with when she was born at the National Zoo 3½ years ago, is leaving. At 1:30 Tuesday, the bear will depart on a special flight from Dulles International Airport to Chengdu, China. This was fans’ opportunity to say goodbye. Like pilgrims, they proceeded down the Asia Trail, bypassing the sloth bear, the clouded leopard and the Asian small-clawed otter. Many had driven from afar to find the surrounding roads jammed with cars and the wait for a parking space more than an hour (to keep them going, the Connecticut Avenue Starbucks concocted a Pandaccino — a double-chocolate Frappuccino with white mocha, “layered with whip cream and love”). Most of the world’s giant pandas are on loan from China, and cubs born abroad are sent to the Chinese breeding program before they turn 4. Although the National Zoo has had pandas since 1972, Bao Bao is only the second surviving one born there; her older brother Tai Shan moved to China in 2010. Vicky Zhang, a Rockville resident from China, brought her two U.S.-born children to see her off. “We want the kids to know the panda is from China, and hopefully someday we can go back to see her in China,” she said. “If you mention pandas, everyone knows it comes from China, and we are proud of that.” On her 16-hour nonstop flight, courtesy of FedEx, Bao Bao will be accompanied by a veterinarian as well as a panda keeper who held her when she was a day-old cub. “The keepers who’ve been with her every day are going to miss her, but she’s going to be doing a positive thing, hopefully going on to breed new pandas and release some of them into the wild,” said Erin Kendrick, a clinical nutritionist at the zoo. Bao Bao gets a bear-size luggage allotment, and she’s allowed to carry plants and liquids. Her special “suitcase” will contain 50 pounds of bamboo, two pounds of cooked sweet potatoes, two pounds of apples, 10 gallons of water, and honey water and sugar cane. At 10 a.m., visitors let out a collective “Awww” as Bao Bao received a farewell ice cake in the shape of a Chinese pagoda, made of frozen apple juice, red “leafeater” biscuits and two kinds of bamboo. Adults and children crowded around a table to write postcards to the departing starlet and to her new keepers in China. Some added Chinese characters, to represent the journey to her new home, or the District’s stars and stripes logo, to remind her of her old one. Dear Bao Bao, I will miss you a ton. Why did you have to go? With hugs, kisses, and a lot of love, Beril Gunduzhan “Maybe she will miss us, too,” said Beril, 8, of Bethesda, who was there with her mother and older sister. Why are pandas so adored? “That expression,” said Blaine D’Amico of Arlington. “They seem more friendly and human, even though they are bears. . . . And they’re vegetarians. I mean, a vegetarian bear.” To Melinda Maldonado, an Arlington resident originally from Austin, the love is spiritual. “I think that when you see an animal with a pattern like that — a giraffe or a panda — you realize there’s a God, there’s the entity that created all this,” she said. “It also reminds us that we need to take care of our planet. It’s not just about materialism and greed and one-upping each other.” Although Bao Bao has been receiving ice cakes and extra visitors these past days, the panda probably didn’t know it was her last full day in her birth country, and she may not feel very nostalgic once she figures it out. She has lived in her own enclosure since 2015 — pandas are solitary in the wild — so she’s unlikely to miss her parents, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, or her little brother Bei Bei. Perhaps it was just the unseasonably warm day that inspired her to put on one last show, to gambol around her enclosure, to bat at a burlap bag and to hug a special cardboard suitcase presented to her at 1:30. She wrapped her arms around a hot-pink plastic crate and licked it. That was when Leslie Johnson lost it. “I gave her that crate,” said the Fairfax resident and regular Bao Bao visitor, dabbing at tears. “I’m sad but happy,” she said. “It’s like sending a kid off to college. . . . What we all want for her is to perpetuate the species and have beautiful little cubbies. But it’s hard to watch her go.”	863	"[{""start"": 458, ""end"": 728, ""text"": ""That is why Grindlay has flown to Washington from Ayr, Scotland, five times in the past year alone, and why this visit was the most bittersweet.

The Chinese Embassy served farewell dumplings Thursday at the National Zoo to mark the departure next week of the zoo’s female giant panda, Bao Bao, who is moving to China. The dumplings, prepared by embassy chefs, are traditionally served when a loved one leaves home, the zoo said. The zoo invited its staff to taste the dumplings, made by chefs at the embassy. The 600 dumplings were filled with pork and vegetables, but Bao Bao wasn’t eating them. She is getting presented with a box of panda treats that has a dumpling painted on it. Bao Bao leaves Tuesday from the Smithsonian National Zoo to go to China. The zoo put out a roughly one-minute-long video showing some of the panda’s top — and cutest — moments. The video shows scenes from the panda’s naming ceremony to her early exams — with cute squeaks from the cub at a one-month checkup — and snapshots of her climbing and falling off rocks, rolling and tumbling in snow and eating bamboo. It ends with the hashtag #ByeByeBaoBao. The panda is due to go to China as part of a long-term breeding program with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. All cubs born at the zoo move to China by the time they are 4 years old, according to the zoo. Over the next five days, the zoo has several events planned at its site and online to celebrate and say farewell to Bao Bao. Now 3 years old, Bao Bao leaves the zoo where she was born for a facility in China’s Sichuan province.  Bao Bao’s mother, Mei Xiang, had a second cub about 26 hours later, but it was stillborn. Bao Bao’s name means “precious” or “treasure” in Chinese. Mei Xiang had given birth in 2012 to a cub, but it died six days later. Zookeepers have described Bao Bao as a “miracle.” The bear, which weighs 203 pounds, will travel in a specialized crate and have ice cakes and bamboo treats for the 16-hour flight to China. Keepers have been working with her in the shipping crate so that she gets used to it. It is the second time a giant panda has been shipped from the Washington zoo to China. Tai Shin, a male, was born in 2005 at the zoo, and he moved to China in 2010.	861	"[{""start"": 990, ""end"": 1205, ""text"": ""The panda is due to go to China as part of a long-term breeding program with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.

Bye-bye, Bao Bao. The National Zoo said Wednesday that it is preparing for the departure to China of its female giant panda cub, Bao Bao. Bao Bao created a sensation at the zoo when she was born there Aug. 23, 2013 — then the first cub to survive birth at the zoo since 2005. “As part of the Zoo’s cooperative long-term breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, all cubs born at the Zoo move to China by the time they turn 4 years old,” the zoo said in a statement. China owns all giant pandas in U.S. zoos and requires that cubs born here be sent “home” about the time they reach breeding age. Bao Bao will turn 4 this year. “She’s captured the hearts of people all over the world who watched her grow up on the panda cams,” said Brandie Smith, associate director of animal care sciences, according to the statement. “We are sad to see her go, but excited for the contributions she is going to continue to make to the global giant panda population,” she said. Bao Bao has been living apart from her mother, Mei Xiang, since March 2015. Giant pandas are solitary in the wild, and cubs separate from their mothers to establish their own territories between 18 months and 2 years old, the statement said. The zoo plans a series of farewell events. The panda is scheduled to be flown to China in a few weeks. The zoo has not said exactly when. Bao Bao’s trip to China will come seven years after the zoo’s beloved giant panda Tai Shan made the same trip in February 2010. Tai Shan was born at the zoo July 9, 2005, and was, then, the only giant panda born there to survive beyond infancy. Bao Bao has since been joined at the zoo by Bei Bei, a male giant panda born there on Aug. 22, 2015.	860	"[{""start"": 18, ""end"": 136, ""text"": ""The National Zoo said Wednesday that it is preparing for the departure to China of its female giant panda cub, Bao Bao"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 138, ""end"": 274, ""text"": ""Bao Bao created a sensation at the zoo when she was born there Aug. 23, 2013 — then the first cub to survive birth at the zoo since 2005"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 277, ""end"": 491, ""text"": ""As part of the Zoo’s cooperative long-term breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, all cubs born at the Zoo move to China by the time they turn 4 years old,” the zoo said in a statemen"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 493, ""end"": 651, ""text"": ""hina owns all giant pandas in U.S. zoos and requires that cubs born here be sent “home” about the time they reach breeding age.

First they hauled the armloads of bamboo down the path from the panda house to serve as munchies for the long journey. Then came Bao Bao herself, inside a white shipping crate, borne on a yellow forklift decorated with black panda ears. Then came the cortege of zookeepers who had cared for the giant panda for the past 3  1 /2 years, walking slowly in their gray sweatshirts and tan pants, walkie-talkies in their back pockets. It was a solemn moment at the National Zoo on Tuesday, as those who had fed and marveled at the panda — who had swept her compound and picked up her waste, and who swore she knew them individually — bade her farewell. They waved goodbye as the people from FedEx loaded the food and the crate holding the 205-pound bear into the trucks that would take her to the airport. And they all hugged. Bao Bao, the zoo’s beloved female giant panda, left for her new home in China shortly before 2 p.m. after a string of farewells at the zoo and at Dulles International Airport. “We know it’s coming,” said keeper Stacey Tabellario, who had helped take care of Bao Bao since the panda was born at the zoo in 2013. “It’s something that, especially with the giant pandas, you know exactly when this is coming,” she said. “We know that they’re going … by the age of 4. So we can prepare for it. But that doesn’t mean that we don't get attached.” “She’s on to bigger and better things, but certainly there were some tears this morning as we all watched her get loaded onto the truck,” she said. Dennis Kelly, director of the zoo, called it a “really bittersweet day … While it represents a huge success, we’ve become so fond of Bao Bao … We’re going to miss her so much.” The panda’s FedEx plane — white with orange and blue trim and a huge panda logo near the nose — took off at 1:55 p.m. on the 16-hour, nonstop flight. VIPs and well-wishers looked on quietly and applauded. A toddler with a pacifier in his mouth waved goodbye from his mother’s arms. Earlier at the zoo, Bao Bao had snacked on a treat as she sat in her shipping crate waiting to be taken to the truck. As the forklift with the crate made its way out of the panda compound, a video camera attached to the vehicle’s roof captured the throng of waiting media. A chilly, gray morning was just starting to warm in the sun. Two trucks, one carrying the panda, the other carrying the road food, departed about 10:30 a.m. They were escorted by National Zoo police and then by airport police along the way. After the trucks and many of the reporters had left, Tabellario spoke about Bao Bao. “She’s very independent compared to our other bears,” she said. “She’s a little bit sassy … You have to work for attention from her, which makes it pretty valuable when she gives you those kind of funny moments where she wants to interact with you.” She said she thought that Bao Bao will do well in new surroundings. Over the holiday weekend, about 60,000 people visited the zoo, officials said. Some came from as far away as Scotland just to say their goodbyes and offer well wishes to Bao Bao. There were traffic jams throughout the Woodley Park neighborhood as visitors tried to get a last look at the panda. Bao Bao enjoyed several treats over the past few days, including a farewell ice cake, made with frozen apple juice, bamboo and biscuits, in the shape of a Chinese pagoda. When Bao Bao’s truck arrived at Dulles early Tuesday afternoon, about 15 people with special passes waited on the tarmac outside. Jamie Levinson, 9, had skipped school with her dad to come say goodbye. Her advice to Bao Bao: “It’s going to be a fun and cool experience, and you’re where you should be.” Bao Bao’s flight to Chengdu, China, will involve a team of pilots, a veterinarian and another veteran panda keeper. Also aboard: 50 pounds of snacks and liquids. Her luggage includes the bamboo, sweet potatoes, apples, water and sugar cane. In China, she will go into quarantine at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Dujiangyan, Sichuan province. Most giant pandas around the world are on loan from China, and cubs that are born abroad are sent to the Chinese breeding program before they turn 4. The National Zoo has had pandas since the 1970s. Bao Bao’s older brother, Tai Shan, moved to China in 2010. The National Zoo still has three other giant pandas, including Bao Bao’s 1-year-old brother, Bei Bei, and their mother Mei Xiang, 18, and father Tian Tian, 19. This spring, the zoo said it plans to breed Mei Xiang, who they believe has at least one more chance to produce a cub. Officials have said Bao Bao is special because she is only the second surviving cub born at the facility. Some keepers have dubbed her the “miracle” giant panda. The panda, whose name means “precious” or “treasure” in Chinese, was born in August 2013. Mei Xiang gave birth to a second cub about 26 hours later, but that cub was stillborn. Many members of the zoo staff were thoughtful as they helped prepare Bao Bao for her journey Tuesday. Brandie Smith, the zoo’s associate director for animal care sciences, said that after Tai Shan left, no panda cubs had survived at the zoo for several years. “A lot of people had given up,” she said. “So Bao Bao, to me, is the new beginning of the National Zoo’s panda program. “This is part of the journey we always expect her to take,” she said. “A lot of people expected me to be sad right now, but I’m so happy for her and proud of what we accomplished. I feel nothing but joy.”	859	"[{""start"": 429, ""end"": 645, ""text"": ""It was a solemn moment at the National Zoo on Tuesday, as those who had fed and marveled at the panda — who had swept her compound and picked up her waste, and who swore she knew them individually — bade her farewell"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 647, ""end"": 799, ""text"": ""They waved goodbye as the people from FedEx loaded the food and the crate holding the 205-pound bear into the trucks that would take her to the airport."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 821, ""end"": 996, ""text"": ""ao Bao, the zoo’s beloved female giant panda, left for her new home in China shortly before 2 p.m. after a string of farewells at the zoo and at Dulles International Airport."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1237, ""end"": 1360, ""text"": ""“We know that they’re going … by the age of 4.

The farewell ice cakes are in the freezer. The road food, which includes 50 pounds of bamboo, is being readied. The broom, dustpan and poop bags are on hand, for cleanup during the flight. And Bao Bao, the Smithsonian National Zoo’s heaven-sent “miracle,” is getting accustomed to the airplane shipping crate that says: “Contents: One panda.” On Thursday, a keeper used soothing words and honey water to coax the beloved 3-year-old into the crate in which, on Feb. 21, she will journey from her birthplace in Washington to a new home in China. “C’mon, Bao,” the keeper, Marty Dearie, said. “Good girl. Good job!” Bao Bao now weighs 203 pounds, and it seems like ages since she fit in the palm of his hand when she was born in August 2013. He was the first person to hold her. She was 2 days old, and people at the zoo were praying that she would survive. They had been devastated in September 2012 when the zoo’s adult female giant panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth to a four-ounce cub — her first in years — and it died six days later. “My biggest memory of that moment [is] the raw emotion,” said Brandie Smith, the associate director for animal care sciences, who had wept with others after the cub’s death. “It was the excitement over having a cub, and when we did, our plans were of the future,” Smith said. “Everyone had been celebrating with us, and then, everyone’s sadness and disappointment.” But the following summer, Bao Bao arrived. She was born on a Friday during the evening rush hour, as thousands of people watched live on the zoo’s black-and-white panda cams. Mei Xiang gave birth to a second cub 26 hours later, but it was stillborn. “I’m not a religious person,” Dearie said at the zoo Thursday. “I’ve said, ‘She’s a miracle.’ And I don’t even mean that religiously. We went from the [deceased] cub in 2012 to Bao, and all that she means to this team, it’s pretty amazing.” “The whole journey, to me, starts . . . with that cub in 2012,” he said. “Mei Xiang hadn’t had a baby since 2005. There was some . . . thought in the scientific community that she may never get pregnant again.” And when that cub was born, and died six days later, “we went from a really high high to a really low low in a week,” he said. But a short time later, the zoo sent Dearie and another keeper to a giant panda conservation center in China to study different approaches to panda care and reproduction. Three days after they returned, Bao Bao was born. And two days later, Dearie held her in his hand. She was small but sturdy, he recalled. She had a loud voice and a thin layer of coarse white fur. She was given a quick medical examination and returned to her mother. “We were literally running up and down the hallways in here dancing around for joy,” he said. “I’ve never been that excited about anything I’ve ever done in my life, honestly.” On Dec. 1, 2013, after a global online vote, she was named Bao Bao, which means “precious” or “treasure” in Chinese. In subsequent years, the panda nation has followed Bao Bao’s antics on the cams and social media. In 2014, she accidentally touched an electric wire designed to keep her in her compound and fled up a tree for two days. That same year, she beat out the Star-Spangled Banner in a Smithsonian popularity contest. Bao Bao is the second giant panda to be shipped to China from the National Zoo. The first was Tai Shan, a male, who was born in 2005 and, to the dismay of panda fanatics, moved to China in 2010. The transfers are part of a long-standing arrangement with China, whereby any giant panda cubs born in the United States must go to China around age 4 to breed. China owns all giant pandas in the United States and leases them to American zoos. Now it is Bao Bao’s turn. Dearie and zoo veterinarian Katherine Hope will go with her on the trip. She is traveling on a nonstop 16-hour FedEx “Panda Express” flight from Dulles International Airport to the Chinese city of Chengdu, the zoo said. Bao Bao will be the only cargo, FedEx said. She will then go into quarantine at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Dujiangyan, Sichuan province. Meanwhile, the zoo’s commissary is preparing flavored ice cakes that are being constructed in its giant freezer. They will be presented to Bao Bao in the days leading up to departure. The commissary is also preparing to pack up food and 10 gallons of water for the journey. The food includes bamboo — a panda staple — a 25-pound bag of beet-colored panda biscuits, two pounds of apples, and two pounds of sweet potatoes cooked with the skins on. There will be no pears. Word is that Bao Bao doesn’t like pears. The day of her departure will be emotional. “I was curator of pandas when she was born,” Smith said. “She’s my girl. Bao Bao is special to me, because of my job at that time and because of the significance of her birth.” “So . . . I’ll take a private moment on that day” to be with her, she said. “The panda house is my happy place.” But the zoo has three other giant pandas: Bao Bao’s 1-year-old brother, Bei Bei; and their parents, Mei Xiang, 18, and Tian Tian, 19. And breeding season is approaching. The zoo said Bei Bei is being weaned from his mother and will eventually move into Bao Bao’s vacated section of the giant panda compound. Over the next few months, Mei Xiang will be bred again, and in August, “we’re having panda cubs!” Smith said. “Of course, we are,” she said. “I have no doubt.”	858	"[{""start"": 189, ""end"": 342, ""text"": ""And Bao Bao, the Smithsonian National Zoo’s heaven-sent “miracle,” is getting accustomed to the airplane shipping crate that says: “Contents: One panda."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 343, ""end"": 543, ""text"": ""On Thursday, a keeper used soothing words and honey water to coax the beloved 3-year-old into the crate in which, on Feb. 21, she will journey from her birthplace in Washington to a new home in China."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1711, ""end"": 1888, ""text"": ""“I’ve said, ‘She’s a miracle.’ And I don’t even mean that religiously.

She’s landed! Bao Bao, the giant panda that was born at the National Zoo and left Tuesday for its new home in China has landed there, according to the official Chinese news agency. A video shows the 3-year-old panda landing at an airport in Chengdu in Southwest China in the dark. There were hugs and tears on Tuesday as zookeepers, staff and well-wishers said their goodbyes to the giant panda that was born at the zoo in 2013. She and several zoo staffers flew on a FedEx plane on a 16-hour flight to China. Katharine Hope, the veterinarian who was aboard with Bao Bao, said the panda was happy and comfortable. She said Bao Bao ate, drank and slept the whole trip. The zoo staff will help the panda transition to her new home. Now that she’s in China, she will go into quarantine at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Dujiangyan, Sichuan province. Bao Bao will enter the giant panda breeding program when she is about 5 or 6 years old. Most giant pandas around the world are on loan from China and cubs that are born abroad are sent to the Chinese breeding program before they turn 4. The National Zoo has had pandas since the 1970s. Bao Bao’s older brother, Tai Shan, moved to China in 2010. The zoo still has three other giant pandas.	857	"[{""start"": 281, ""end"": 427, ""text"": ""There were hugs and tears on Tuesday as zookeepers, staff and well-wishers said their goodbyes to the giant panda that was born at the zoo in 2013"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 970, ""end"": 1117, ""text"": ""Most giant pandas around the world are on loan from China and cubs that are born abroad are sent to the Chinese breeding program before they turn 4"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 882, ""end"": 968, ""text"": ""Bao Bao will enter the giant panda breeding program when she is about 5 or 6 years old"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	835	2023-05-03T10:51:51.804866Z	2023-05-03T10:51:51.804963Z	126.832
Bye-bye, Bao Bao. One of the National Zoo’s giant pandas, Bao Bao, will go to China in late winter 2017 as part of a breeding agreement the zoo has with a wildlife conservation group there. Under the agreement, giant pandas born at the zoo in the District are sent to China by their fourth birthday. And Bao Bao, who was born there on Aug. 23, 2013, will turn 4 in 2017. “Bao Bao is very special to us at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo,” said Brandie Smith, associate director of animal care sciences, in a statement. Zoo officials said Bao Bao is the “first surviving cub born at the zoo since 2005.” Smith said in her statement that Bao Bao has “captured the hearts of people all over the world who watched her grow up on the panda cams, and she has been an ambassador for conservation.” “We are sad to see her go, but excited for the contributions she is going to continue to make to the global giant panda population,” she said. There will be a public event to “say goodbye and celebrate” before she leaves for China. Details will be released soon. Bao Bao is the older sister of Bei Bei, the zoo’s baby panda, who turned 1 in the summer. Bao Bao will be prepared for her travel to China. Zoo officials said they are working to make sure she will be safe and comfortable. She has to get used to being in a crate, which is how she will make the flight. Zookeepers said a crate will be put in her habitat area so she can get used to it, gradually. Keepers will have her walk through it each day and then acclimate her to staying in it for short periods of time with the door closed. She’ll get treats while she’s in the crate. For the trip to China, she will have a small entourage of a veterinarian and a panda keeper from the National Zoo. FedEx provides the plane for the flight to Chengdu, China. Zoo officials said it is best for pandas to fly in the winter when it is cooler. Bao Bao will be closely monitored during the journey and have her favorite treats, such as cooked sweet potatoes, water, apples, pears and bamboo. She isn’t the first giant panda to fly to China under the zoo’s breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. In 2010, Tai Shan — Bao Bao’s older brother — flew to China under similar conditions. Once she gets to China, she will be taken by bus to the conservation center. Her team from the National Zoo will stay for a bit until she adjusts to her new home, zookeepers said. She will enter the giant panda breeding program when she reaches sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 6.	856	"[{""start"": 58, ""end"": 189, ""text"": ""Bao Bao, will go to China in late winter 2017 as part of a breeding agreement the zoo has with a wildlife conservation group there."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 190, ""end"": 370, ""text"": ""Under the agreement, giant pandas born at the zoo in the District are sent to China by their fourth birthday.

Zoo officials said Bao Bao is the first surviving cub born at the zoo since 2005. — Dana Hedgpeth Prosecutors hold off on murder charge The U.S. attorney’s office for the District has decided against pursuing one of two first-degree murder charges that D.C. police said they filed against a 27-year-old man on Tuesday. Daryl Thompson, of Suitland, Md., remains charged with first-degree murder in the Aug. 29 fatal shooting of Tyler McEachern, 23, in the 3100 block of Buena Vista Terrace SE. He has been ordered detained. On Tuesday, police and the mayor announced at a news conference that Thompson had been charged in McEachern’s death and in the July 30 fatal shooting of Edward Roberts Jr., 29, who was shot in the 3500 block of 14th Street NW in Columbia Heights. Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office, said prosecutors decided not to pursue the case involving Roberts. Miller said that case “remains under investigation.” MARYLAND Day-care worker charged with abuse An employee of a day-care center in Upper Marlboro was arrested after allegedly abusing a 3-year-old boy at the center, police said Thursday. About 8 a.m. on Tuesday, D’Aira Nichel Thompson, 25, of Cheltenham was trying to restrain the boy in a chair when she told him to put his head down and slammed it on a table, Prince George’s County Police said in a statement. The boy suffered a contusion to the right side of his head. Thompson was charged with second-degree child abuse and second-degree assault. — Justin Wm.

When celebrities leave our area permanently, it would be easy for us to turn our backs on them, make a clean break and go on to other things. But after her wildly popular stay here, and after the enormous affection she evoked, it is not so simple to let go. So it seems only proper to report that Bao Bao, the young giant panda who was born at the National Zoo, and achieved creature stardom there, has made her first public appearance in her new home in China. After a month in quarantine, Bao Bao “made her public debut” Friday, said the website of China Global Television Network (CGTN). CGTN describes itself as China’s new international media organization. In its account, CGTN said fans were already on hand for Bao Bao’s appearance at a panda center outside Chengdu in Sichuan province. It was unclear whether any were from Washington, where she was born Aug. 23, 2013, to panda parents Mei Xiang and Tian Tian. Most of the world’s giant pandas are on loan from China, and cubs born abroad go back for breeding before turning 4. On Feb. 21, after fond farewells, sheltered in a white shipping crate, Bao Bao, as she was bound to be, was FedExed off to China. Now, according to CGTN, she seems to be having the same effect there as here. Her debut was made, CGTN said, “under the eyes of an adoring crowd.”	854	"[{""start"": 919, ""end"": 1034, ""text"": ""Most of the world’s giant pandas are on loan from China, and cubs born abroad go back for breeding before turning 4"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1036, ""end"": 1164, ""text"": ""On Feb. 21, after fond farewells, sheltered in a white shipping crate, Bao Bao, as she was bound to be, was FedExed off to China"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	832	2023-05-03T10:42:20.755859Z	2023-05-03T10:42:20.755925Z	89.638
The playful panda cub Bao Bao is leaving the National Zoo for China early next year, zoo officials announced Thursday. As part of a breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, all giant pandas born at the Washington zoo move to China by the time they turn 4. Bao Bao will celebrate her fourth birthday August 23. “Bao Bao is very special to us at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo,” Brandie Smith, associate director of animal care sciences, said in a statement. “She was the first surviving cub born at the Zoo since 2005.” “We are sad to see her go,” she added, “but excited for the contributions she is going to continue to make to the global giant panda population.” Bao Bao will fly FedEx to Chengdu, in southwestern China, in the first several months of 2017. The zoo said that she was leaving so early in the year because it is better for pandas to travel in the winter months, when it isn’t hot. From Chengdu, Bao Bao will be driven to a base run by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, where she will be part of a breeding program that aims to increase the wild panda population. The International Union for Conservation of Nature recently took the giant panda off the endangered species list and classified it as “vulnerable,” estimating that there are about 1,860 pandas in the wild. Bao Bao’s older brother, Tai Shan, moved to China in 2010. With Bao Bao’s departure, the zoo will be down to three pandas: Bao Bao’s mom and dad, Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) and Tian Tian (t-YEN t-YEN), and her younger brother, Bei Bei, who was born in August 2015. The zoo said that special opportunities for visitors to say goodbye to Bao Bao will be announced soon. For now, we’re left to replay a video of her having fun in the snow. kidspost@washpost.com	853	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 117, ""text"": ""e playful panda cub Bao Bao is leaving the National Zoo for China early next year, zoo officials announced Thursda"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 339, ""end"": 483, ""text"": ""Bao Bao is very special to us at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo,” Brandie Smith, associate director of animal care sciences, said in a statement"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 693, ""end"": 786, ""text"": ""Bao Bao will fly FedEx to Chengdu, in southwestern China, in the first several months of 2017"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1604, ""end"": 1705, ""text"": ""The zoo said that special opportunities for visitors to say goodbye to Bao Bao will be announced soon"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 119, ""end"": 336, ""text"": ""As part of a breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, all giant pandas born at the Washington zoo move to China by the time they turn 4.

Bao Bao left for the airport Tuesday morning, the first part of the giant panda’s journey from the National Zoo to her new home in Chengdu, China. Shortly after breakfast, zookeepers called Bao Bao in from the panda yard and into a steel crate that she would ride in for the 8,500 mile trip, according to a National Zoo statement. Several staff members and Bao Bao headed to Dulles International Airport, where a special “Panda Express” jumbo jet was scheduled to take off at about 1:30 p.m. A panda keeper and veterinarian will travel to China with Bao Bao, making sure she stays healthy and feeding her bamboo and leafeater biscuits. After the plane arrives in Chengdu, a team of Chinese panda keepers will take Bao Bao to Dujiangyan Panda Base, where she will stay for 30 days to make sure she does not carry any diseases. It’s not known whether the panda will stay at Dujiangyan after the 30 days are over, according to the zoo. Bao Bao, who is now 3½ , will join the giant panda breeding program after she turns 5. Giant pandas are no longer considered “endangered” but are a “vulnerable” species in the wild, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are about 1,850 living wild in China, according to a 2014 survey. Three giant pandas remain at the National Zoo: Bao Bao’s father, Tian Tian (pronounced tee-YEN tee-YEN); her mother, Mei Xiang (may-SHONG); and her little brother, Bei Bei. In about two years, Bei Bei will travel to China to join Bao Bao and big brother Tai Shan, who was born at the National Zoo in 2005.	852	"[{""start"": 933, ""end"": 1018, ""text"": ""Bao Bao, who is now 3½ , will join the giant panda breeding program after she turns 5"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 0, ""end"": 145, ""text"": ""ao Bao left for the airport Tuesday morning, the first part of the giant panda’s journey from the National Zoo to her new home in Chengdu, China"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 147, ""end"": 329, ""text"": ""Shortly after breakfast, zookeepers called Bao Bao in from the panda yard and into a steel crate that she would ride in for the 8,500 mile trip, according to a National Zoo statement"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 331, ""end"": 490, ""text"": ""Several staff members and Bao Bao headed to Dulles International Airport, where a special “Panda Express” jumbo jet was scheduled to take off at about 1:30 p.m"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	830	2023-05-03T10:38:08.769434Z	2023-05-03T10:38:08.769495Z	139.462
When Bao Bao was born in August 2013, the National Zoo’s not-yet-giant panda cub was the size of a stick of butter. Laura Schmechel of Mount Vernon, Virginia, remembers watching on the zoo’s online Panda Cam, marveling at the tiny bear who was “always moving around and having fun.” Bao Bao seemed like a smaller version of her, the 14-year-old says. One year later, when Bao Bao celebrated her first birthday, Brandon Budd of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, joined in the festivities at the zoo. “She got a cake,” remembers Brandon, now 11, “though she didn’t eat it that fast.” Soon enough, she was climbing trees, rolling down hills and — like Laura and Brandon — “moving a lot.” Next week, the playful bear whose Chinese name means “precious” or “treasure” will make her biggest move of all. On February 21, she will step inside a shipping crate and board the “Panda Express,” a FedEx plane that will fly her, a panda keeper, a veterinarian and more than 55 pounds of bamboo and treats to the Chinese city of Chengdu. She’s leaving her family behind, including younger brother Bei Bei, for a new home at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. Older brother Tai Shan has lived there since 2010. Under an agreement with Chinese officials, all pandas born at the National Zoo move to China around the time they turn 4, shortly before they reach breeding age. Researchers at the panda center are trying to increase the number of pandas in the wild. Today, that number is about 1,800, all of them in China. “This is the time that Bao Bao would be moving away from her mom in the wild,” panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle said at the National Zoo on Saturday. Standing near her were hundreds of members of Friends of the National Zoo who snapped photos, wrote farewell messages and said goodbye to the 203-pound panda. “She’s ready to go on and look for a suitable mate and to have babies of her own in the next couple years,” MacCorkle said. The crowd at the panda habitat included dozens of kids wearing panda hats or panda jackets. Among them were Laura, Brandon and 12-year-old Matt Kilareski, who came with his family from Woodbridge, Virginia. On his right foot was a walking boot, from a recent surgery, and in his hands was a stuffed panda, a souvenir from the San Diego Zoo when Matt was a baby. Like Matt, the panda — named Panda — recently acquired a boot on its right foot. “Panda was with me during surgery,” Matt said. His sister “used a bit of cardboard and fabric, wrapped with tape, to give him a bit of a boot after the surgery, because I have a boot, too.” In the enclosure behind Matt, Bao Bao ran down the hill, seeming to show off. Her reward: a “fruitsicle” made with a frozen pear, frozen apple juice and water. There are no fruitsicles in China, only special “panda bread” and seemingly endless fields of gourmet bamboo, but it was unclear whether anyone had told Bao Bao about her new home. With her back against a tree, the panda faced the crowd, licked her treat and fell asleep. She was still clutching the frozen fruit. If you go What: Say goodbye to Bao Bao at the National Zoo. Where: 3001 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington. When: Facebook Live events Thursday through Monday, including a behind-the-scenes look at packing for a panda’s trip around the world. Watch Bao Bao enjoy treats at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. daily, at the zoo or through the online Panda Cam. How much: Free. How old: All ages.

Bao Bao, the National Zoo’s 3-year-old female giant panda, will be shipped to China on Feb. 21, the zoo said Monday. The move is part of a long-standing arrangement with China, whereby any giant panda cubs born in the United States must go to China around age 4. China owns all giant pandas in the United States and leases them to American zoos. Bao Bao will be 4 on Aug. 23. In China, giant pandas participate in a breeding program when they reach sexual maturity, between 5 and 6 years old, the zoo said. The zoo said Bao Bao will travel via FedEx “Panda Express” from Dulles International Airport and will first go into quarantine at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, in Dujiangyan, Sichuan province. The zoo will have online and in person programs to mark her departure. Bao Bao was born at 5:32 p.m. Aug. 23, 2013, as thousands of people watched on the zoo’s panda cams. Her mother, Mei Xiang, had five false pregnancies between 2007 and 2012, and in 2012 delivered a female cub that died six days later. That cub had underdeveloped lungs that led to liver problems. Bao Bao is the second giant panda to be sent to China after being born at the National Zoo. The first was Tai Shan, a male, who was born July 9, 2005. He was moved to China in 2010. He is now 11. The zoo has three other giant pandas: a male cub, Bei Bei, 1; an adult female, Mei Xiang, 18; and an adult male, Tian Tian, 19.	850	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 116, ""text"": ""ao Bao, the National Zoo’s 3-year-old female giant panda, will be shipped to China on Feb. 21, the zoo said Monday."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 117, ""end"": 261, ""text"": ""The move is part of a long-standing arrangement with China, whereby any giant panda cubs born in the United States must go to China around age 4"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 376, ""end"": 505, ""text"": ""In China, giant pandas participate in a breeding program when they reach sexual maturity, between 5 and 6 years old, the zoo said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1102, ""end"": 1192, ""text"": ""Bao Bao is the second giant panda to be sent to China after being born at the National Zoo"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	828	2023-05-03T10:30:01.321365Z	2023-05-03T10:30:01.321485Z	499.402
