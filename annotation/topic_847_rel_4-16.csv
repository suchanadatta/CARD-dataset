California's school vaccination rate is at its highest level since 2001 after the state required almost all public school children to get immunizations. State public health officials released data this week that showed that nearly 96 percent of this year’s kindergartners have received all the required vaccines. That’s a nearly three-point increase over last year, health officials said. The rate is above the level that experts say is needed to prevent measles transmission. Students entering school in 2016-2017 were the first to be enrolled under a law that abolished the personal-belief exemption to legally required vaccines for school entry. The law was passed after the 2014-2015 measles outbreak in Disneyland. Compared with the 2015-2016 school year, the proportion of students attending kindergarten in 2016-2017 reported to have received all required vaccines rose from 92.8 percent to 95.6 percent, a 2.8 percentage point increase over one year and a 5.2 percentage point increase over the two years since 2014-2015, according to California health department data. The 2016-2017 rate is the highest reported since the current set of immunization requirements for kindergarten went into effect beginning in the 2001-2002 school year. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and author of the new legislation, hailed the rise in the kindergarten vaccination rate. “This success is a first step toward reducing the number of unimmunized people putting our families at risk for preventable diseases, thereby restoring community immunity throughout our state in the coming years,” he said. An increasing number of parents across the United States and in other countries are choosing not to immunize their children because of “personal beliefs.” Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but the highly contagious disease has made a return in recent years largely because of people who reject vaccinating their children. Vaccination advocates and health officials said that despite improvements, children in California schools and communities with lower rates of vaccine use remain at higher risk of contracting and transmitting vaccine-preventable diseases. Recent changes to California’s school immunization laws did not apply to earlier groups of children who are no longer of school age. Unimmunized older children and adults were among those who caught measles during the Disneyland outbreak. Earlier this month, an unvaccinated Laguna Beach High School student was quarantined after contracting measles, county health officials said. The school identified six other unvaccinated students who may have been exposed to the virus when the infected student was on campus March 29. All were barred from attending school and have to stay home until April 18, the Orange County Register reported.

If you want to quantify the alarming impact of the anti-vaccine movement, the chart above is a good place to start. It plots the cumulative number of new measles cases by month, for each year from 2001 to 2014. There were 644 new measles cases in 27 states last year, according to the CDC. That's the biggest annual number we've seen in nearly a quarter-century. The vast majority of people who contracted the disease were unvaccinated, including the dozens of cases related to an outbreak at Disneyland in Orange County, California, which is basically Ground Zero in our current epidemic of anti-vaccine hysteria. A 2014 AP-GfK survey found that only 53 percent of Americans were confident that vaccines are safe and effective, which is similar to the proportion who believe that houses can be haunted by ghosts. I don't need to make the case about how harmful these beliefs are -- it's been done plenty of times before, and moreover studies show that arguing with anti-vaxxers only makes them more confident in their beliefs. But the latest CDC data illustrate the troubling resurgence of a disease that, as of 2000, had been declared eliminated. Anti-vaxxers are quite literally turning back the clock on decades of public health progress. Related: Vaccine deniers stick together. And now they're ruining things for everyone Correction: An earlier version of this post mis-stated the number of Americans confident in the safety of vaccines. It is 53 percent, not 51 percent.	237	"[{""start"": 363, ""end"": 614, ""text"": ""The vast majority of people who contracted the disease were unvaccinated, including the dozens of cases related to an outbreak at Disneyland in Orange County, California, which is basically Ground Zero in our current epidemic of anti-vaccine hysteria."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1149, ""end"": 1241, ""text"": ""Anti-vaxxers are quite literally turning back the clock on decades of public health progress"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	246	2023-03-25T11:09:55.321139Z	2023-03-25T11:10:39.100183Z	141.959
Just before 7 p.m. last Thursday, as the Disneyland measles outbreak was emerging, the Los Angeles Times published an outraged editorial. It didn’t blame Disneyland, where the outbreak originated before going on to infect 70 people across six states. Nor did it blame any public agency. Instead, it took aim at a buoyant movement that won’t “get over its ignorant and self-absorbed rejection of science.” The faction was the anti-vaccine movement — its holy text a retracted medical study, its high priest a disgraced British doctor named Andrew Wakefield. “The prospect of a new measles epidemic is disturbing,” the editorial said. “So is the knowledge that many ill-informed people accept a thoroughly discredited and retracted study in the journal Lancet that purported to associate vaccination with autism.” Officials from Mexico to California are now scrambling to contain an outbreak that began at Disneyland but has now spilled across state lines, infecting dozens, many of whom never received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR). If the outbreak proves anything, it’s Wakefield’s enduring legacy. Even years after he lost his medical license, years after he was shown to have committed numerous ethical violations, and years after the retraction of a medical paper that alleged a vaccine-autism link, his message resonates. Facebook is populated by pages like “Dr. Wakefield’s Work Must Continue.” There’s the Web site called “We Support Andrew Wakefield,” which peddles the Wakefieldian doctrine. And thousands sign petitions pledging support. Wakefield’s defenders frequently harbor a deep distrust of government. “They often suggest that vaccination is motivated by profit and is an infringement of personal liberty and choice; vaccines violate the laws and nature and are temporary or ineffective; and good hygiene is sufficient to protect against disease,” said a 2008 editorial in Nature. Others, from Katie Couric to Jenny McCarthy to Michele Bachmann, have caught the anti-vaccine bug. And in Wakefield, who still preaches the gospel of anti-vaccination from Texas, such individuals find a true martyr — a man who has sacrificed everything to take on powerful pharmaceutical companies and the biggest villain of all: the government. Those who came to hear him speak in 2011 at Graceview Baptish Church in Tomball, Texas, left messages of encouragement, according to the New York Times: “We stand by you!” and “Thank you for the many sacrifices you have made for the cause!” Another person, suddenly aware that a reporter was in the midst, warned the writer she better be careful. “Be nice to him,” the woman said. “Or we will hurt you. “To our community, Andrew Wakefield is Nelson Mandela and Jesus Christ rolled up into one,” J.B. Handley, co-founder of a group that disputes vaccine safety, told the Times. “He is a symbol of how all of us feel.” The career Wakefield charted before his crash was one of hard-charging research — and suspicion. Born into a family of doctors in 1957, his first target was Crohn’s disease, which he announced was the result of the measles virus. By 1995, his claim that the measles virus was also linked to ulcerative colitis, raised eyebrows. “He is not a pathologist but a surgeon,” Belgian pathologist Karel Geboes told Slate in 2010. “… His claim was too rigorous, and there was no real proof for the hypothesis.” Soon after, as the Sunday Times later found, Wakefield connected with a United Kingdom lawyer named Richard Barr, who was working on litigation against a producer of MMR. The contact would prove very beneficial and lucrative for Wakefield. First, Barr set Wakefield up with some candidates for a study that would raise concerns about the vaccine. “He has deeply depressing views about the effect of vaccines on the nation’s children,” Barr told a group of MMR clients and contacts in a letter reported by the British Medical Journal. “He is also anxious to arrange for tests to be carried out on any children … who are showing symptoms of possible Crohn’s disease. The following are signs to look for. If your child has suffered from all or any of these symptoms could you please contact us, and it may be appropriate to put you in touch with Dr. Wakefield.” Wakefield had what he needed to publish a study. It was based on 12 kids. And it broadcast concern that MMR could cause a bowel disorder and autism. Nine of the immunized children were found to be autistic. “If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988,” he wrote. The news rocketed across the globe; the media ran hot with the story. “A controversial study has suggested that autism may be a side effect of immunization against measles, mumps and rubella,” New Scientist reported weeks later. The effect was immediate. Large swaths of people resisted immunization. According to a 2002 BBC survey, nearly 50 percent of doctors reported parents were less willing to allow medical professionals to give vaccinations to their children. (In 2012, southwest Wales was hit with an unprecedented measles outbreak that infected 1,219 people, the Wall Street Journal reported.) Then the wheels fell off on the paper. Wakefield had several undisclosed conflicts of interest. He had applied for measles-related patents while doing the research, journalists found. And attorneys trying to prove the vaccines were unsafe had paid him $600,000. The British Medical Journal finally said he had manipulated the numbers to imply direct vaccine culpability. “Junk science,” Nature called it. On Feb. 2, 2010, more than a dozen years after it was published, Lancet retracted the paper. In May 2010, British regulators revoked his license, finding him guilty of “serious professional misconduct.” It concluded that his work was “irresponsible and dishonest.” Wakefield rejected the findings, calling the disciplinary action “a little bump in the road.” Under such circumstances, most doctors would retreat into obscurity. But not Wakefield. He still believes in the mission, attracting scores of supplicants. Even today, he fiercely defends his campaign against vaccines and has found a sympathetic community in his adopted state of Texas. Asked in 2011 by the New York Times if he still believed MMR had caused the autism in his now discredited paper, he was unequivocal. “Is that a serious question?” he asked. “Yes, I do still think MMR was causing it.”	236	"[{""start"": 405, ""end"": 556, ""text"": ""The faction was the anti-vaccine movement — its holy text a retracted medical study, its high priest a disgraced British doctor named Andrew Wakefield."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1557, ""end"": 1905, ""text"": ""Wakefield’s defenders frequently harbor a deep distrust of government. “They often suggest that vaccination is motivated by profit and is an infringement of personal liberty and choice; vaccines violate the laws and nature and are temporary or ineffective; and good hygiene is sufficient to protect against disease,” said a 2008 editorial in Nature"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4707, ""end"": 4865, ""text"": ""“A controversial study has suggested that autism may be a side effect of immunization against measles, mumps and rubella,” New Scientist reported weeks later."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3100, ""end"": 3291, ""text"": ""By 1995, his claim that the measles virus was also linked to ulcerative colitis, raised eyebrows. “He is not a pathologist but a surgeon,” Belgian pathologist Karel Geboes told Slate in 2010."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4864, ""end"": 5103, ""text"": "".

"Measles is an extremely contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. Once common in the United States, it was eliminated here in 2000 but is resurgent today, mostly because of the growing number of people who are refusing to vaccinate their children or delaying those vaccinations, experts say. Here is the information you need to understand the burgeoning debate about measles. Who gets the measles? What are the symptoms? Mostly children, but unvaccinated adults who never have had the disease are at risk too. It starts with a fever, runny nose, sore throat and red eyes and is followed by the well-known rash of red dots that can cover your entire body, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But I've heard measles can be more dangerous than that. Yes. Fatalities are rare in the United States, but one or two of every 1,000 children who contract measles will die from the disease, according to Anne Schuchat,  director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. More common complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and deafness. Pregnant women who get the measles may give birth prematurely or deliver low-birth-weight babies. How is it spread? Mostly by coughing and sneezing. Also, measles can spread if you touch a surface where the virus is present and then touch your nose or mouth. The virus can live on a surface or hang in the air for as long as two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. In fact, measles is so contagious that 90 percent of people who are not immune can get it from being near a single person with the disease, according to the CDC. People are contagious from four days before the rash appears until four days after it shows up. When did the vaccine become available? The vaccine, which uses a live virus to stimulate production of antibodies to the measles virus, became available in 1963. Widespread use began in the mid- to late 1960s. Before then, the United States averaged hundreds of thousands of measles cases every year. There were periodic outbreaks, mostly among unvaccinated children, until 2000, when endemic measles was declared eliminated in the United States. If I've had the measles, am I immune? What if I'm not sure? Yes, you only get measles once. If you're older than 52, chances are good you've had the measles. If you're not sure, your doctor can perform a simple blood test to determine that. If you're younger, she may just skip the blood test and give you the measles booster injection because there is no harm in doing that, according to Mark Sawyer, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. How effective is the measles vaccine? The first dose, given at 12 months, is about 95 percent effective. The second dose, given at age 4 to 6 years, improves those odds to 98 or 99 percent. So it's possible to get the measles even if you've had the two recommended doses. But it's extremely unlikely. If so many people are vaccinated, why is measles spreading in the United States? Last year, there were 644 cases of measles in the United States, the most since 1994. A month into 2015, there already have been 102 cases in 14 states. The CDC says last year's outbreak — and, most likely, this year's as well — was caused by unvaccinated travelers becoming infected abroad and bringing the virus into the United States. In parts of southern and northern California, where some communities have high rates of people who have not been immunized, the disease is more easily spread. Last year, for example it tore through an Amish community in Ohio where many people had not been inoculated. Children less than a year old typically are not vaccinated, because their immune systems are not ready. And some people, children and adults alike, cannot be immunized for medical reasons. That makes both groups vulnerable to the virus. All 50 states require vaccination for some or all of the following diseases before children can enter school: mumps, measles rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio, according to the CDC. Why would anyone refuse to be vaccinated or to inoculate his children? In 1998, a study published in the prestigious medical journal the Lancet suggested that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could cause autism. The research by Andrew Wakefield was later discredited and the study was retracted by the journal in 2010. But the paper set off a movement among people who continue to believe that there could be a link between the vaccine and autism. It has been fanned by the support of some celebrities. Vaccination is also opposed by some people on religious grounds, and some states allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children based on ""personal beliefs."" California, epicenter of the current outbreak, is one of them. Do children really get 10 vaccinations at once, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Monday? Close, but not really. Under the standard recommended vaccine schedule, a child could receive five injections and an oral vaccine at two months. Some of those injections cover more than one illness — the DPT injection, for example, protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). At 12 months, the same child might receive six injections that protect against eight diseases, if the physician didn't use a combination vaccine, Sawyer said. But most do. However, many physicians will spread those multiple injections over a few weeks if it makes parents uncomfortable to administer so many during a single visit, Sawyer noted. Doctors are free to tinker with the schedule a bit, he said. But that becomes a problem when some parents decide to delay vaccinations by months and even years, he said. In that case, children are going too long without critically needed protections against very serious illnesses, he said. Right now, with a measles outbreak in Southern California, Sawyer said he would not recommend even a short delay in a measles immunization. See the vaccination schedule recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics here. Isn't measles a lot worse in some other countries? Why? Yes. Twenty million people get measles annually and in 2013, about 145,700 of them, mostly children younger than 5, died.  Consider the 2014 totals in the Philippines (53,357 confirmed cases) and China (50,960 confirmed cases), according to the World Health Organization. In the Philippines, Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 disrupted vaccination programs and accelerated the measles outbreak there, according to Steve Cochi, senior adviser in the Global Immunization division of the CDC. In China, the disease has spread as the country failed to immunize its huge population of migrant workers, he said. Still, conditions have vastly improved abroad as a result of a concerted vaccination campaign. The number of measles deaths worldwide dropped by 75 percent from an estimated 544,200 in 2000 to 145,700 in 2013, according to the WHO. If I'm traveling to one of these places, what should I do? And what if I'm bringing young children? Adults and teenagers who aren't immunized should get both doses of the vaccine, at least 28 days apart, according to the CDC. There's also no harm in any adult getting the booster. Children who are at least 12 months old should also get both doses, again separating the injections by 28 days. Infants who are at least six months old can get one dose of the vaccine to help protect them, even though the recommended vaccine schedule doesn't call for them to be immunized until 12 months. However, those children will subsequently need two more doses to be fully protected, Sawyer said. Read more: Adults are skipping vaccines too--for lots of diseases We can't just blame anti-vaxxers.

Months after a virulent measles outbreak spread from one Disneyland visitor to more than 100 California residents, the state that’s been described as an “anti-vaccination hotbed” is poised to pass one of the nation’s toughest laws requiring immunizations. The bill approved by the California Assembly Thursday strikes down the state’s personal belief exemption, which allows parents to opt their children out of vaccinations for religious reasons. Under the new rules, only children with serious health problems (such as a compromised immune system) would be exempt from mandatory vaccination schedules, and those who opt out will have to be homeschooled. The legislation now goes to California Gov. Jerry Brown (D). According to the Los Angeles Times, it’s unclear if Brown will sign it. “The governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit, and any bill that reaches his desk will be closely considered,” Evan Westrup, Brown’s spokesperson, told the Times Thursday. [Disneyland measles outbreak strikes in anti-vaccination hotbed of California]  If the bill becomes law, California will become only the third state in the country to deny exemptions based on religious convictions. The other two are Mississippi and West Virginia. But in California, many if not most of those who opt out of the state’s mandatory vaccination schedules do so on the basis of “personal belief exemptions,” rather than religious ones. Though decades of studies have found vaccines to be safe, strains of vaccine skepticism are particularly high in some California communities. In January, the Post’s Wonkblog found that in some school districts the fraction of kindergartners with PBES is more than half. At a handful of private schools it topped 75 percent. Thirty-two other states bar vaccination exemptions based on personal or moral beliefs. The debate about the vaccination bill has been vitriolic in recent weeks. According to the LA Times, Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), a pediatrician and an author of the bill, has received death threats. Protesters at the California Democratic Party’s convention in Sacramento last month called the right to refuse vaccinations “a civil rights issue” and compared the state to Nazi Germany. Hundreds of parents who converged on the Assembly this week said that the legislation would take away their right to make decisions about what’s best for their child’s health. And Assemblyman Mike Gatto (D-Glendale) told the LA Times that the bill was likely unconstitutional because it “infringes on the rights of children to attend school.” [Amid measles outbreak, anti-vaccine doctor revels in his notoriety]  For their part, proponents of the legislation were not above using tear-jerker tactics to support their cause. On Wednesday, advocates for stricter requirements stood beside 7-year-old leukemia survivor Rhett Krawitt as he delivered a petition bearing 30,000 signatures to the governor. Earlier this year, Krawitt gave a rousing speech at a local school board meeting in which the first grader said “I give a damn” about mandatory vaccinations. Because his own immune system has been compromised by chemotherapy, Krawitt’s parents say, he can’t be vaccinated, leaving him vulnerable to measles and other infectious diseases. The issue of vaccinations is so charged because it pits personal choices against an epidemiology principle known as “herd immunity.” As the Department of Health and Human Services explains it: When a critical portion of a community is immunized against a contagious disease, most members of the community are protected against that disease because there is little opportunity for an outbreak. Even those who are not eligible for certain vaccines—such as infants, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals—get some protection because the spread of contagious disease is contained. When the level of immunization drops low enough, diseases like measles, which is highly contagious, can spread rampantly among the unprotected population. While healthy unvaccinated kids usually survive a bout of measles (and it’s worth noting that there have been no fatalities reported so far from the Disneyland outbreak), people with weakened immune systems — the elderly, children under five, immunocompromised people like Krawitt — are vulnerable to severe and sometimes fatal complications. “Measles is not a benign disease,” Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University, wrote in Slate earlier this year. Ariel Loop, a Pasadena mother whose 4-month-old son Mobius was infected during the Disneyland measles outbreak, told the LA Times she was relieved that the bill got approved. “I’m hoping Jerry Brown does the right thing and signs it once it gets through the last Senate [vote],” Loop said.  	234	"[{""start"": 1279, ""end"": 1461, ""text"": ""But in California, many if not most of those who opt out of the state’s mandatory vaccination schedules do so on the basis of “personal belief exemptions,” rather than religious one"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2078, ""end"": 2263, ""text"": ""Protesters at the California Democratic Party’s convention in Sacramento last month called the right to refuse vaccinations “a civil rights issue” and compared the state to Nazi Germany"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4045, ""end"": 4387, ""text"": ""While healthy unvaccinated kids usually survive a bout of measles (and it’s worth noting that there have been no fatalities reported so far from the Disneyland outbreak), people with weakened immune systems — the elderly, children under five, immunocompromised people like Krawitt — are vulnerable to severe and sometimes fatal complications."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1605, ""end"": 1872, ""text"": ""n January, the Post’s Wonkblog found that in some school districts the fraction of kindergartners with PBES is more than half.

"The ongoing measles outbreak in the United States has reached a record for any year since the disease was  eliminated in this country 14 years ago, with 288 cases of the potentially deadly infection reported in 18 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. The largest measles clusters are in Ohio (138 confirmed cases), California (60) and New York (26), according to the CDC. Almost all — 97 percent — have been brought into the country by travelers, mainly Americans, who contracted the infection abroad. About half of those were people who picked it up in the Philippines, where a large measles outbreak has affected more than 32,000 people, causing 41 deaths,  since January alone, said Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. In this country, the biggest outbreak is centered in the Amish community in Ohio, where many of the residents are unvaccinated, the CDC reported. In Virginia, two cases were confirmed earlier this month. ""This is a wake-up call for travelers and parents to make sure vaccinations are up to date,"" Schuchat said. ""Measles vaccine is very safe and effective and measles can be serious,"" she added. ""It's very infectious."" Forty-three of the people in this country who have come down with measles required hospitalization, most often for pneumonia, she said. No deaths have been reported here. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that generally affects young children, causing fever, a runny nose, a cough and a distinctive rash all over the body. This year, however, more than half the people who have come down with it are 20 years old or older, according to CDC data. About one in 10 children also gets an ear infection and one in 20 comes down with pneumonia. A person with measles is contagious as long as four days before the symptoms are apparent. Parents and even physicians who haven't seen measles in years may be unaware of the early warning signs. The largest number of confirmed cases of measles since the infection was eliminated in the United States in 2000 occurred in 2011, when 220 were recorded. The CDC hasn't seen this many cases so early in the year since 1994, when 764 people were infected by this time, Schuchat said. In the past 20 years, a concerted public health campaign, especially among lower-income families, has made measles outbreaks rare in the United States. But an estimated 20 million people are infected in Europe, Asia, Africa and elsewhere each year, and 122,000 of them die. In the United States, the number of people who choose not to be immunized for religious, philosophical or personal reasons has begun to become a public health problem, Schuchat said. Others are unaware of, or unable to get, vaccinations before they arrive in the United States. A small number of adults can lose their immunity over time and may need to be re-vaccinated. Authorities aren't sure how the Amish community in Ohio contracted the disease, but Schuchat said they believe that people traveling to conduct faith-based work abroad are involved. According to the CDC, 40 importations of the infection were attributed to unvaccinated U.S. travelers returning from abroad. Steven Nolt, a history professor at Goshen College in Indiana who has written about the Amish, said some groups do travel to places such as Kenya, Ukraine and Central America to do mission or relief work. He said many  Amish do vaccinate themselves and their chidren, but others refuse. Some, Nolt said, have a ""more traditional, conservative, old-fashioned way of life and set of sensibilities that views medicine as something that is used to heal or cure, rather than to prevent"" disease. Others have a ""theologically informed...sense that we should place our trust in God and not in vaccines."" Schuchat urged anyone who isn't sure whether his or her immunizations are up to date to get another dose of the vaccine, especially if traveling to places like the Philippines or doing health care work. Though the vaccine generally isn't given to children before the first birthday, infants traveling abroad can be inoculated with one dose as young as six months, Schuchat said. The vaccine is generally administered in two doses a few years apart. People whose immune systems are suppressed and pregnant women should not receive the vaccine, she said. Adults born before 1957 likely had the measles and should be immune, she added. The vaccine became available in 1963.

"The Disneyland measles outbreak has shined a harsh spotlight on anti-vaccine communities in California and around the country. Dozens of people have fallen ill with the disease, the vast majority of whom are unvaccinated. The year 2014 was already a banner year for measles in the U.S., with preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing the highest number of cases in over two decades. My colleague Jason Millman reported last week on the results of a study showing that vaccine skeptics tend to cluster together in like-minded, often wealthy communities. Since the study focused on just a handful of northern California counties, I'd like to extend that analysis by looking at vaccine refusal across the entire state of California -- as a result both of vaccine denial and religious objections. The map below is a first crack at that. Using data from the California Department of Public Health, it divides the state into equal-area grids, and within each area it counts the number of public school kindergartners with what's known as a ""personal belief exemption"" (PBE) to state vaccine requirements. The hexagon markers are sized by the total number of kindergartners in the area, and colored according to the percent of them with PBEs. It's important to note a couple things. First, the actual number of kindergartners entering school without their full slate of vaccines is considerably higher than this map suggests. This map only represents kids whose parents have taken a stance against vaccines by applying for a PBE. Statewide about 2.5 percent of kindergartners fall into this category. Overall nearly 10 percent of California kindergartners don't start school fully vaccinated. Most of these kids are ""conditional entrants,"" who, for whatever reasons, are behind in their vaccines but plan to get them. It's also worth noting that the map only shows public school kids, as geographic data for private schools wasn't available. Kindergartners in private school are more than twice as likely (5.3 percent) to have a PBE than public school kids (2.5 percent). Still, the map provides a useful barometer of the level of principled opposition to vaccines in the state, and that's how I'll be discussing it. Orange County, home to Disneyland, stands out as a cluster of dark red, as do parts of coastal San Diego county. The wealthy southern California coast from Malibu up to San Luis Obispo also stands out. Farther north, Santa Cruz, Marin and Sonoma counties are dark red. Inland there's a belt of anti-vaccine intensity from about Fresno, up through Sacramento and into Yuba county. Pockets of high PBE rates dot most of the northern California landscape. On the other hand, the Los Angeles area is generally vaccine-friendly, as are much of the San Francisco and Silicon Valley regions. The relatively low-income areas in the central valley also have low rates of vaccine opposition. Since California provides district-level vaccination data going back to 2000, it's also possible to map the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment over time. Check out the three maps below.   Back in 2000, only 0.77 percent of California kindergartners had personal belief exemptions from vaccines. By 2013, that percentage had more than quadrupled to 3.15 percent. The scale on these maps tops off at 5 percent. But in some individual school districts, the actual PBE rate is much, much higher. At River Springs Charter School in Temecula, California, nearly a quarter of the 556 kindergartners had personal belief exemptions this year. A third of the kindergartners at the Visions in Education public school in Carmichael hold PBEs, as do 51 percent of kindergartners at Ocean Grove Charter School in Boulder Creek. At a handful of private schools, the PBE rate is 75 percent or more. It goes without saying that a measles outbreak in these communities could be devastating. These parents are gambling with the lives not only of their children, but of other kids in their communities as well -- especially of young children and toddlers who aren't old enough to get all their vaccines yet. According to USA Today, six of the Disneyland measles cases were among infants too young to be vaccinated. We need what's known as ""herd immunity"" to keep these most vulnerable populations safe from infectious diseases. For measles, that immunity kicks in with vaccination rates somewhere between 83 and 94 percent, according to the CDC. So even letting five percent of the kids in your community skip the vaccine is inviting trouble. Fortunately, the news out of California isn't all bad. Starting with the current school year, California parents are required to consult a health care professional before being certified for a PBE. That's resulted in a drop in the PBE rate from 3.2 percent last year to 2.5 percent this year -- a welcome trend. The Disneyland outbreak also seems to be giving the issue enough visibility that some Californians previously on the fence are willing to change their minds. I'm also singling out California simply because it does such a great job of making these numbers publicly available -- as far as the states go, it's far from the bottom of the pack on vaccination rates. According to numbers compiled by the Bloomberg Data team, California is ranked 39th in the nation on overall vaccination rates, with 65.3 percent of its children receiving all seven CDC-recommended shots. By contrast the bottom-ranked state, Alaska, only has a 59.1 percent vaccination rate, while the top, Mississippi, has a rate of 76 percent. With any luck, in the aftermath of the California measles outbreak we'll see these number climb."	232	"[{""start"": 1017, ""end"": 1133, ""text"": ""public school kindergartners with what's known as a \""personal belief exemption\"" (PBE) to state vaccine requirements."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1970, ""end"": 2099, ""text"": ""Kindergartners in private school are more than twice as likely (5.3 percent) to have a PBE than public school kids (2.5 percent)"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3113, ""end"": 3415, ""text"": ""Back in 2000, only 0.77 percent of California kindergartners had personal belief exemptions from vaccines.

"Infectious diseases that we normally think of as rare in the United States are making a comeback. In recent years, pertussis -- also known as whooping cough -- has returned to the headlines. A measles outbreak that struck a Texas megachurch community late last summer sickened 21 people. And just recently, at least 16 people got sick during a measles outbreak in Ohio. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported 13 measles outbreaks so far in 2014 -- the most since 1996. The diseases are highly contagious, but they are also preventable; two of the many recommended childhood vaccinations protect against measles and pertussis. And measles had been considered effectively eliminated in the United States. What's going on, exactly? Here are some answers. Why are so many outbreaks happening? Although it's a complex problem, health officials say one key culprit is that more and more people are choosing not to get their kids vaccinated against these diseases. For instance, in California parents are increasingly seeking personal or religious exemptions from vaccination requirements for their kids to attend schools. Substandard vaccination rates create an opening for outbreaks, which often start when an unvaccinated person catches the disease while traveling abroad and spreads the illness to friends and family upon returning. But aren't overall vaccination rates really high? Nationally, yes, though it wasn't always this way. Before the 1990s, rates languished below 80 percent for most childhood vaccines at the time. In 1993, after the 1989-1991 measles outbreak, Congress enacted the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to promote childhood vaccinations. CDC data show that vaccination rates are now above 90 percent range for several routine vaccines, including the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and whooping cough vaccines. Public health officials target a 90 percent vaccination rate for most routine childhood vaccines. Experts say that a population has ""herd immunity"" when enough people are vaccinated to prevent a disease from taking hold. This chart shows how vaccination rates climbed after VFC's enactment: If vaccination rates are high, why are we seeing so many outbreaks? That's because vaccination rates aren't geographically uniform. Public-health experts say that high non-vaccination or exemption rates can occur among pockets of people, particularly at the county or city level. And some research has found that outbreaks are far more likely to happen in these areas, such as during the recent whooping cough outbreaks in California. Why are people not vaccinating their kids? There are a number of factors at play. Many of the diseases we vaccinate against are so rare here now that the public's awareness of vaccination might have decreased. But the one reason that has most alarmed public-health experts lately has been the rise of the anti-vaccine movement. Groups and activists such as celebrity Jenny McCarthy have repeatedly claimed that vaccines cause autism. This vaccine-autism concern may be causing a drop in childhood vaccination rates in many communities, including in affluent, well-educated ones. Do vaccines cause autism? Science gives a resounding no. Anti-vaccine activists often hang their case on a study published in the British journal The Lancet in 1998. This study, which posited a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, was widely discredited by the scientific community and eventually retracted. But the anti-vaccine movement has still gained steam. Anti-vaccine activists have also raised concerns about vaccines made with the mercury-based preservative known as thimerosal, which they worry could cause brain damage in developing kids. It's true that vaccines once routinely contained thimerosal, which government officials recognized as generally safe. But this preservative has been phased out of nearly all vaccines as a precautionary measure. Anti-vaccine activists also worry that the CDC's recommended vaccination schedule could overwhelm infants' immune systems by packing too many doses into a short period of time. Although the number of vaccinations that kids receive now is higher than it used to be, the main ingredients in the vaccines have actually decreased in amount. Even if these ingredient amounts hadn't decreased, research has found no relationship between those amounts and autism risk. Vaccines do carry a risk of side effects, but they are usually minor. The CDC has concluded from reviewing the scientific evidence that there's no causal link between childhood vaccinations and autism. Routine vaccines save lives, says science. A new study from CDC researchers led by Anne Schuchat analyzed what happened to disease rates as childhood vaccination rates increased starting in the early 1990s. The researchers used these findings to model the resulting effect over the kids' lifetimes. In the analysis, the researchers factored in most routine vaccines recommended for children below age 6 (among them the MMR and whooping cough vaccines). Their findings: Routine childhood vaccinations given between 1994 and 2013 will save 732,000 lives and prevent 322 million cases of illness and 21 million hospitalizations over the course of the children's lifetimes. Vaccines provide high public-health bang for the buck. The CDC researchers also weighed the benefits of the vaccinations (""savings in direct and indirect costs that accrued from averting illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths"") against costs (""program costs included vaccine, administration, vaccine adverse events, and parent travel and work time lost""). In 2009 alone, the researchers determined, each $1 spent on vaccines and their administration yielded $10 in benefits to society. And the vaccinations from 1994-2013, the researchers found, will save society a net $1.38 trillion, both directly (by reducing health expenses) and indirectly (via the economic activity that is saved from avoided illnesses). That's almost 10 percent of the U.S. economy's gross domestic product. The CDC study may actually underestimate some benefits. Here's why. It doesn't account for cost savings to society brought on by preventing the diseases' spread to unvaccinated populations, ""a powerful driver of cost-effectiveness"" in the researchers' view. The study also excludes the influenza and hepatitis A vaccines, and thus fails to capture their benefits. What's the bottom line? Vaccines may not be perfect. But the science suggests that they are effective -- especially when enough people are receiving them -- and there's still no evidence that they cause autism."	231	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 96, ""text"": ""s diseases that we normally think of as rare in the United States are making a comeba"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 824, ""end"": 991, ""text"": ""Although it's a complex problem, health officials say one key culprit is that more and more people are choosing not to get their kids vaccinated against these disease"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 993, ""end"": 1363, ""text"": ""For instance, in California parents are increasingly seeking personal or religious exemptions from vaccination requirements for their kids to attend schools.

In 2000, the United States declared that measles had been eliminated. But the country experienced a record number of measles cases last year, while an outbreak this month that began at Disneyland has been linked to dozens of cases in California and other states. This has raised obvious concerns, both because of the overall anti-vaccination movement in this country and because it’s not considered a good thing for a virus to suddenly surge back into circulation. So, how did we get here? How did we travel from elimination to a record number of cases and a new, dangerous outbreak in just 15 years? Let us take a walk through the recent history of measles and the United States. ELIMINATION First, it is important to know that “elimination” does not really mean “eradication.” When the United States said that measles had been eliminated in the country, this did not mean there would be no other cases within the nation’s borders; rather, it meant that it was no longer endemic. In other words, any measles cases that occurred would come from people traveling to the country. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines measles elimination as 12 months or more without “continuous disease transmission” in a geographic area.) BEFORE AND AFTER ELIMINATION Before the virus was eliminated and before vaccinations became routine in 1963 (well, for the most part, but we’ll get back to that in a moment), it infected millions of people each year and was responsible for hundreds of deaths. The CDC says that until that point, every year 3 to 4 million people were infected, 48,000 of them went to the hospital and 400 to 500 people died. After the elimination declaration in 2000, between 37 and 220 people reported having measles each year in the United States — until last year. WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR? The number of measles cases in the country skyrocketed, nearly tripling the highest number seen in the preceding 13 years. As noted above, there were no more than 220 cases in a given year between 2001 and 2013. In 2014, there were 644 cases stemming from nearly two dozen outbreaks. The jump was dramatic, with more cases just last year than there were in the five preceding years combined. VACCINATIONS AND THE ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT Obviously, the recent surge in cases is highlighting the still-extant anti-vaccination movement in the United States. Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy, among others, have been given large platforms from which to express their views about the dangers of vaccinations, even though the gas that seemingly fueled the anti-vaccination movement for so long — a medical study published in 1998 — was retracted in 2012. (My colleague Terry McCoy has much more here about the doctor who wrote the retracted paper.) There are other reasons a person may not get vaccinated, of course, ranging from religious or philosophical reasons to someone moving to the country and not being aware of or able to obtain the vaccination. Yet there is a different danger posed by people who choose not to get vaccinations for their children: A recent study found that these people are clustered together, which means that measles, a highly-contagious disease, can more easily spread to additional children. Ultimately, the vast majority of children in the United States are vaccinated for measles. The majority of people who get measles have not been vaccinated. In California, for example, half of the people with measles in the current outbreak have not been vaccinated (and vaccination status is still not known for many of the others). Still, even if people aren’t getting vaccinated, they aren’t spontaneously developing measles. The disease has to come from somewhere. A huge number of measles cases originate outside the United States, as measles remains common in other countries. (The CDC estimates that each year, about 20 million people around the world get measles and that 122,000 people die from it.) “The only way it can come is from other countries, usually from U.S. travelers who travel abroad and who are not protected through vaccinations, who get infected overseas and bring it back,” Jane Seward, deputy director of the CDC’s viral disease division, told me during one of the outbreaks last year. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association — Pediatrics last year found that 88 percent of measles cases in the country “were internationally imported or epidemiologically or virologically linked to importation.” There were a few cases not linked to any kind of importation over a period from 2001 to 2011, but they did not seem to be endemic, researchers said. The study ultimately found that while endemic measles was still eliminated, international importation remained a serious risk. As long as people are traveling to and from other countries, and as long as some of these people may be unvaccinated and they may come into contact with other unvaccinated people, the risk remains of measles cases in the United States. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA? There are 59 confirmed cases of measles in California residents this month, and 42 of those cases were tied to exposure at Disneyland or Disney’s California Adventure Park, the state’s Department of Public Health said Wednesday. (The CDC says there are also cases in five other states.) Those 59 people ranged from seven months to 70 years old. The vaccination status of 34 of these people is known, the health department said, and all but six of those people had not been vaccinated. One other person had received one of the two recommended doses. The situation in the state points to a specific danger presented by an infectious disease that can be spread by people who have traveled overseas and those who have not been vaccinated. Travelers from overseas who do not live in the United States or visit it frequently will often go to tourist attractions such as theme parks, which draw very large crowds. If those crowds contain people who have not been vaccinated, they can potentially contract a disease and bring it back to a community full of other people who may be susceptible. For public health officials in the state, they are monitoring possible measles cases and expecting additional cases to emerge in the near future. They also have a clear message about what they say can help stave off this sort of thing. “The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated,” Ron Chapman, director of the health department, said Wednesday.	230	"[{""start"": 263, ""end"": 366, ""text"": ""This has raised obvious concerns, both because of the overall anti-vaccination movement in this country"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2369, ""end"": 2600, ""text"": ""Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy, among others, have been given large platforms from which to express their views about the dangers of vaccinations, even though the gas that seemingly fueled the anti-vaccination movement for so long"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3066, ""end"": 3229, ""text"": ""A recent study found that these people are clustered together, which means that measles, a highly-contagious disease, can more easily spread to additional children"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3322, ""end"": 3563, ""text"": ""The majority of people who get measles have not been vaccinated.

"California public health authorities have conducted genetic tests on the virus that caused the measles outbreak sweeping the country, but that has not led them to the source of the outbreak so far. Writing in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state public health officials said they had genotyped the virus from 30 of 110 California residents who contracted the disease but still cannot determine the source of the outbreak, which began in late December in two adjacent Disney theme parks in Southern California. All the specimens ""were measles genotype B3, which has caused a large outbreak recently in the Philippines, but has also been detected in at least 14 countries and at least six U.S. states in the last 6 months,"" they wrote. The Philippines had more than 53,000 confirmed cases of the measles last year. ""International travel to countries where measles is endemic is a well-known risk factor for measles, and measles importations continue to occur in the United States,"" they wrote in the report, which was released late Friday. ""However, U.S. residents also can be exposed to measles in the United States at venues with large numbers of international visitors, such as other tourist attractions and airports. This outbreak illustrates the continued importance of ensuring high measles vaccination coverage in the United States."" The CDC said last week that 121 people in 17 states and the District of Columbia had come down with the measles. Authorities have blamed the spread of a disease that was eliminated in 2000 largely on people who, for personal or religious reasons, are choosing not to have their children vaccinated or are delaying their immunizations. Update: On Tuesday afternoon, the CDC said the number of cases had grown to 141 in 17 states and Washington, D.C. an increase of 20 cases over the past week. Among the 110 California patients, ""49 (45%) were unvaccinated; five (5%) had 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine, seven (6%) had 2 doses, one (1%) had 3 doses, 47 (43%) had unknown or undocumented vaccination status, and one (1%)"" appeared to have been vaccinated or was previously infected by measles, the officials wrote. Twelve of the unvaccinated patients were infants who could not be vaccinated because they were too young; the measles vaccine is not recommended for children under a year of age. Among the other 37,  ""28 (76%) were intentionally unvaccinated because of personal beliefs, and one was on an alternative plan for vaccination,"" they wrote. Fifteen cases have been linked to the theme park exposure in six other states -- Arizona (seven), Colorado (one), Nebraska (one), Oregon (one), Utah (three) and Washington (two).  There also have been 10 cases in Canada and one in Mexico, they wrote.

"The 2015 measles outbreak already has spread to 84 people, more than health officials typically see in an entire year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. Most of the cases are traceable to an outbreak at Disneyland and another theme park in Southern California that began in late December and now has spread to six other states, including Utah, Washington, Oregon and Colorado. In all, measles has reached 14 states, according to Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The outbreak has generated sometimes fierce criticism of people who, for personal reasons or because they mistrust the vaccine, choose not to have their children immunized and prompted at least two school systems in California to ban unvaccinated students from school. Schuchat held a briefing for reporters and others Thursday in an attempt to “prevent measles from getting a foothold and becoming endemic again.” She urged parents to get the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine for their children and themselves, noting that the two-dose regimen is 97  percent effective and has been proven safe despite unproven concerns that it can lead to autism. She also said children should get their first dose at age 1, when it is recommended. Some parents have been delaying the age of first immunization. “MMR vaccine [is] very safe, very effective, really necessary,” Schuchat said. “And the 12-month routine first dose, we really strongly recommend. "">Measles, which is caused by a virus, is highly contagious. The respiratory illness is airborne, spread from person to person by coughing and sneezing. It is so infectious that an  unvaccinated person can contract it by inhaling the virus hours after a person with the disease has left a room. It can lead to potentially serious complications, including pneumonia, brain damage and deafness. About 15 percent of the people infected in the current outbreak required hospitalization, Schuchat said. The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000, but it has been resurgent in recent years, fueled by huge epidemics in other countries that were imported into the United States by travelers and spread mostly among unvaccinated people. Last year, for example,  when the measles toll in the Philippines reached 50,000 cases, the United States saw 644, including a cluster in Ohio among unvaccinated people in the Amish community."	228	"[{""start"": 557, ""end"": 824, ""text"": ""The outbreak has generated sometimes fierce criticism of people who, for personal reasons or because they mistrust the vaccine, choose not to have their children immunized and prompted at least two school systems in California to ban unvaccinated students from school"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1502, ""end"": 1793, ""text"": ""Measles, which is caused by a virus, is highly contagious.

There has been an outbreak of measles in the United States for the past two months. During this time, you may have read about the outbreak or overheard your parents talking about it. KidsPost thought it would help to explain what’s going on. What is measles? Measles is a viral infection that used to be a common childhood disease in the United States. Before the measles vaccine was given to American children in 1963, there were about 500,000 cases and 450 deaths reported each year. In the past 10 years, there have been an average of 60 cases of measles each year. Compare that to the 20 million cases that occur worldwide each year. Is measles serious? Most kids who get measles are sick for seven to 10 days. It begins with the symptoms of a cold: runny nose, cough, sore throat, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and fever. After a few days, a red, blotchy rash starts on the face and spreads all over the body. Serious complications include dehydration, pneumonia or an inflammation of the brain called encephalitis. Is measles contagious? When the Ebola scare hit last summer, one of the things doctors told people is that Ebola, while serious, is not highly contagious. The reason for this is because you can’t catch Ebola unless you come in direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the infection. Health officials reassured the public that Ebola was not airborne. That means you can’t catch it from breathing the same air as someone who has the infection. But measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to science. People with measles can spread the infection for four days before the onset of the rash and four days after. (That means people are contagious before they know they have measles.) Not only is measles spread through airborne exposure, but the virus can remain in the air for two hours after an infected person has left the area. How is measles treated? Like most viral infections, there is no specific treatment for measles. If someone gets the infection, he is treated with rest, fluids and fever medication. In some cases, people are hospitalized because they developed a complication of the disease. When did the current outbreak begin? The outbreak began in December and was linked to Disneyland in Anaheim, California. It’s presumed that the original patient entered the United States from another country. The infection spread rapidly to people who had not been immunized against it. To date, more than 120 confirmed cases have been reported in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Are you at risk for catching the infection? Most children receive two measles shots. The first is usually given between 12 months and 15 months. The second is usually given between ages 4 and 6. Vaccines aren’t completely effective, but if you’ve had both measles vaccines, your chances of becoming infected after being exposed to the virus are less than 2 percent. Why have so many people come down with measles? Over the past two decades, some parents have become concerned that vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they prevent. Many scientific studies have shown this isn’t true, but some people are still reluctant to give their children shots. Most states require children to be vaccinated against measles and other diseases to attend school. The reason for this policy is simple. The more people who are vaccinated, the less likely an outbreak will occur. This process is called herd immunity. Each jurisdiction has its own rules about mandatory vaccinations. Some, such as Maryland, have a very strict policy about immunizing students. But all states other than Mississippi and West Virginia allow parents not to vaccinate their children because of the family’s religious beliefs. Nineteen states also allow parents that option if the vaccinations are against their personal beliefs. Why are some people upset about the outbreak? Because there is a vaccine for measles, it is a preventable disease. And the way to prevent the spread of the disease is to keep most of the population immunized against the virus. However, some children can’t get the vaccine because they have cancer, other diseases that weaken their immune system or they are too young. If parents choose not to vaccinate their children, it puts others at risk. That’s why some people are upset about what’s taking place. — Howard J.

Momentum is building in California to eliminate the ability of parents to opt out of vaccines for their kids on the basis of “personal beliefs.” Reacting to a measles outbreak in the state, five Democratic members of the California legislature proposed legislation Wednesday that would repeal the “personal belief exemption.” The provision allows a waiver of the vaccination if a parent or guardian signs a form that says immunization is contrary to his or her beliefs. According to the Los Angeles Times, more than 13,000 California kindergarten students have waivers due to their parents’ personal beliefs, with more than 2,700 of those based on religious beliefs. There is no official breakdown of the nature of the beliefs specified by parents. However, significant numbers of Americans think vaccines are harmful to the health of children, despite the absence of supporting evidence, and are egged on by a few medical professionals as well as some libertarians. [Amid measles outbreak, anti-vaccine doctor revels in his notoriety] Anti-vaccine sentiment is blamed in part for the current measles outbreak that began in California’s Disneyland in early December and has since spread to at least eight states and Mexico, with 103 cases in California. The bill would not change provisions of the law allowing exemptions certified by a physician and based on concerns about children with medical conditions, such as allergies, that could cause them to react badly to vaccination. “People are starting to realize, ‘I’m vulnerable, my children are vulnerable,'” State Sen. Richard Pan, a sponsor and Democratic pediatrician from Sacramento, said at a news conference. “We should not wait for more children to sicken or die before we act. … As a pediatrician, I have personally witnessed children suffering life-long injury or death from vaccine-preventable infection. This does not have to happen.” [The saddest story Roald Dahl ever wrote, about his daughter’s death from measles]  California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) indicated he would be open to the legislation, though he did not commit himself. “The governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit, and any bill that reaches his desk will be closely considered,” spokesman Evan Westrup told the Associated Press. Separately, U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, Democrats from California, released an open letter to the California secretary of health and human services expressing their concerns about the state’s exemptions. “While a small number of children cannot be vaccinated due to an underlying medical condition,” they wrote, “we believe there should be no such thing as a philosophical or personal belief exemption, since everyone uses public spaces. As we have learned in the past month, parents who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their own family at risk, but they also endanger other families who choose to vaccinate.” Related Everything you need to know about measles	226	"[{""start"": 470, ""end"": 666, ""text"": ""According to the Los Angeles Times, more than 13,000 California kindergarten students have waivers due to their parents’ personal beliefs, with more than 2,700 of those based on religious beliefs."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 749, ""end"": 965, ""text"": ""ever, significant numbers of Americans think vaccines are harmful to the health of children, despite the absence of supporting evidence, and are egged on by a few medical professionals as well as some libertarian"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2767, ""end"": 2954, ""text"": ""As we have learned in the past month, parents who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their own family at risk, but they also endanger other families who choose to vaccinate."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	235	2023-03-25T09:18:45.517701Z	2023-03-25T09:18:45.517799Z	267.771
"  Measles have infected 129 people in 13 states in 2014, the most in the first four months of any year since 1996, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday as they warned clinicians, parents and others to watch for the potentially deadly virus. Thirty-four of the cases were imported via travel to other countries, including 17 from the Philippines, where a huge outbreak has affected 20,000 people and caused 69 deaths, said Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. There have been no measles deaths reported from the outbreak in the United States, and none since 2003. But Schuchat acknowledged that ""it's probably just a numbers game, probably just a matter of time until we have more.""   One or two of every 1,000 cases of measles are fatal, according to the CDC. California, with 58 cases, has been hit hardest by one of the 13 separate outbreaks of measles in the United States. New York has seen 24 infections and Washington state has had 13. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that generally affects young children, causing fever, a runny nose, a cough and a distinctive rash all over the body. About one in 10 children also gets an ear infection and one in 20 comes down with pneumonia. A person with measles is contagious as long as four days before the symptoms are apparent, Schuchat said. Parents and even physicians who haven't seen measles in years may be unaware of the early warning signs, she said. In the past 20 years, a concerted public health campaign, especially among lower-income families, has made measles outbreaks rare. The disease has been considered eradicated since 2000. But today, the number of unvaccinated children has begun to become a problem, Schuchat said. Some people are choosing not to have their children immunized for personal reasons and others are unaware of, or unable to get, vaccinations, before they arrive in the U.S. She said the CDC is also seeing growth in the disease pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Before vaccinations were available, about 500,000 people were infected with measles annually in the U.S., a number that fell to about 60 after the disease was all but eliminated in 2000. Since 2010, it has increased to an average of 155 cases per year. Still, she said, fewer than one percent of the toddlers in the United States have received no vaccines at all. ""Vaccinating your children is still a social norm in this country,"" she said. In a telephone news conference Thursday, CDC Director Thomas Frieden lauded the Vaccines For Children program started in 1994, after a measles outbreak from 1989-1991 resulted in 55,000 cases, primarily because poor and uninsured children had not been immunized. Among children born in the following two decades, the CDC estimated, vaccinations prevented an estimated 322 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths, saving about $295 billion. The program provides free vaccinations for measles and 13 other diseases. But ""we can’t let our successes result in complacency,"" Frieden said. ""In fact measles, is very common in some parts of the world...An it travels fast."" He said 20 million people across the globe get the disease annually, and 122,000 of them die. In a separate commentary Thursday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, epidemiologist Julia Shaklee Sammons warned that ""as more parents decline to vaccinate their children, measles incidence is increasing—a fact that alarms me both as a hospital epidemiologist and as a parent of a vulnerable infant too young to receive the measles vaccine."" When infected patients seek medical care, she noted, ""hospitals and clinics may inadvertently fuel transmission if those with measles are not rapidly triaged and isolated."" The proportion of vaccinated children varies by state, depending on the toughness of their immunization laws, Sammons said. Nationally the measles, mumps, rubella vaccination rate is over 90 percent, but in 15 states it is below that standard, she wrote. New York magazine reported last month on schools in California and New York with low immunization rates among students, in part because parents are choosing not to vaccinate them. The CDC said that 54 of this year's 58 California cases were in some way associated with importation of the virus from abroad. Twenty-five of the people infected were not immunized--19 of them because of philosophical objections--and 18 more had no documentation of vaccinations. Three were too young for routine vaccination and three others were not vaccinated for unknown reasons. Eleven had received two or more doses of vaccine that did not protect them. The vaccine is about 97 percent effective, said CDC official Gregory S. Wallace, so about three in 100 people who are vaccinated and exposed to the infection will contract it."	225	"[{""start"": 1707, ""end"": 1971, ""text"": ""But today, the number of unvaccinated children has begun to become a problem, Schuchat said.

The measles outbreak that originated in California’s Disneyland has now spread to seven people in Arizona, with up to 1,000 people in the state potentially exposed to the disease, including nearly 200 children. According to public health authorities, there are now 79 confirmed cases in California, 52 that have been linked to Disneyland. In addition to Arizona, cases have been reported in Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah and Washington state — all connected to California, according to state health officials. This week, two new cases in Arizona — a man and woman — were linked back to a local family reported to be infected when they visited the West Coast amusement park, according to the Arizona Republic. Health officials say the outbreak is a direct result of the increasing number of people — particularly in California — who have chosen to remain unvaccinated, partly because of the erroneous belief that vaccinations can cause autism. Arizona Department of Health Services director Will Humble said anyone who is unvaccinated or undervaccinated — those who have not yet received all doses — who has been exposed to the measles must be quarantined for three weeks. “To stay in your house for 21 days is hard,” he said. “But we need people to follow those recommendations, because all it takes is a quick trip to the Costco before you’re ill and, ‘bam,’ you’ve just exposed a few hundred people. We’re at a real critical juncture with the outbreak.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, the measles virus lives in mucus in the nose and throat. When measles patients cough or sneeze, “droplets spray into the air and the droplets remain active and contagious” for up to two hours. Arizona public health authorities confirmed the woman, who was diagnosed with measles in Maricopa County, had been exposed to the family that recently traveled to Disneyland — ground zero for the current outbreak. Officials said she went on to expose as many as 195 children between Jan. 20 and Jan. 21 at Phoenix Children’s East Valley Center, an urgent care center. It’s still not clear why she was there and whether she was vaccinated, but she has since recovered, according to the health department. “Mitigating factors allowed this person to go unreported for a few weeks. Luckily, we were able to quickly identify the small group of individuals that may have been exposed,” Bob England, director of Maricopa County Department of Public Health, said late last week in a news release. “However, we are not out of the woods yet. California is only a state away and there may be more secondary cases in Maricopa County. This is why we need residents and our healthcare community to be vigilant in identifying measles’ signs and symptoms.” It’s unclear how many people have been exposed to the man who was diagnosed in Pinal County after he came in contact with the same family that had been to Disneyland. Pinal County health officials put out a notice listing five places of business the man had visited and urged people who might have been exposed to him to review their immunization history and monitor themselves “for illness with fever and unexplained rash” until Feb. 13. The measles outbreak began in December, when someone reportedly infected with the virus visited the Disneyland Resorts in Anaheim, Calif. Over the past month, the disease has spread beyond that community, infecting close to 100 people in eight states. Mexico is also now battling the outbreak, according to news reports. California is working to get ahead of the measles. This week, 30 babies were put in home isolation in Alameda County after possible exposure. The disease is especially dangerous for infants because children younger than one year cannot get the MMR vaccine. On Tuesday, nearly 70 students at Palm Desert High School near Palm Springs were banned from class for two weeks because they haven’t been vaccinated. According to the CDC, symptoms of the measles are similar to those of the common cold: fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Humble said although Arizona is working to contain the illness, he’s sure it will spread. “I am certain we will have more just based on the sheer number of people exposed this time,” he said.	224	"[{""start"": 722, ""end"": 954, ""text"": ""Health officials say the outbreak is a direct result of the increasing number of people — particularly in California — who have chosen to remain unvaccinated, partly because of the erroneous belief that vaccinations can cause autism"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1588, ""end"": 1722, ""text"": ""When measles patients cough or sneeze, “droplets spray into the air and the droplets remain active and contagious” for up to two hours"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2765, ""end"": 2930, ""text"": ""It’s unclear how many people have been exposed to the man who was diagnosed in Pinal County after he came in contact with the same family that had been to Disneylan"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2932, ""end"": 3202, ""text"": ""Pinal County health officials put out a notice listing five places of business the man had visited and urged people who might have been exposed to him to review their immunization history and monitor themselves “for illness with fever and unexplained rash” until Feb. 13"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2932, ""end"": 3202, ""text"": ""Pinal County health officials put out a notice listing five places of business the man had visited and urged people who might have been exposed to him to review their immunization history and monitor themselves “for illness with fever and unexplained rash” until Feb. 13"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	233	2023-03-25T09:05:59.752605Z	2023-03-25T09:05:59.752671Z	485.648
