Stratocumulus clouds are rather boring. They’re not as elegant as cirrus clouds (those horsetail wisps high in the sky) or as majestic as cumulonimbus clouds (big, scary thunderheads). But stratocumulus clouds, which hover low in the sky and create vast decks of cloud cover, have a supreme value in our warming world: Their white tops reflect lots of solar radiation back into space. But Earth’s broad portfolio of clouds in the year 2019 could potentially be altered by extreme climate change. Those stratocumulus cloud decks could vanish, further intensifying global warming. That’s the unsettling conclusion of a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, based on a computer model that provides a new warning that climate change could deliver surprises on top of the already existing and clearly predictable consequences. The lead researcher, Tapio Schneider, a climate scientist at Caltech, hypothesized that very high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide could suppress the formation of stratocumulus cloud decks. He and his colleagues modeled the formation of such clouds and, after two years of computer calculations, concluded that the steady rise in atmospheric CO2 could trigger a sudden spike in temperature associated with disappearing stratocumulus clouds. The effect appeared intense if CO2 reached 1,200 parts per million — three times the current level, which is already much higher than the preindustrial level of carbon dioxide. If CO2 reached 1,300 parts per million, the new report states, the global atmospheric temperature would rise 8 degrees Celsius above whatever warming had already been produced from greenhouse gases. “It’s a dramatic effect,” Schneider told The Washington Post. The stratocumulus cloud decks “break up altogether,” he said. “Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once CO2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred,” according to the study. Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT, said of Schneider’s study: “What he’s done is certainly plausible, but these clouds are really hard to simulate. . . . It provides a plausible, but not yet proven, route by which you could have a tipping point in the climate.” Climate scientists have long been confounded by clouds. A cloud can amplify global warming, or it can limit it, depending on what kind of cloud it is, and its size, location, thickness, duration, etc. But clouds are hard to pin down in a computer model. They are remarkably insubstantial elements of the natural world. If you could bring all the clouds and water vapor in the atmosphere to the surface, it would form a liquid layer less than an inch deep, Schneider said, and clouds alone would create a layer no deeper than a coat of paint. “You need to predict what small fraction of that water vapor will condense into clouds,” Schneider said. There is no easy way to test whether clouds would really behave this way in a world with such alarmingly high concentrations of carbon dioxide. What’s certain is that a spike of 8 degrees C, in addition to warming already baked in the cake from greenhouse gas emissions, would presumably be catastrophic, not only for human civilization but for countless species and ecosystems jolted by the rapid climate change. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, when people began burning fossil fuels on a vast scale, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree Celsius, or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, with the warming driven by the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, from about 280 ppm to more than 400 ppm, a level surpassed in 2013 for the first time in recorded history. It is hard to imagine a world with anything near 1,300 ppm CO2. Schneider, for one, does not think such extreme levels of CO2 will actually materialize, simply because he assumes that human civilization will find a way to avoid putting all that carbon into the atmosphere. “I hope there’s going to be sufficient technological progress that we’re not going to get there. But it’s not outside the realm of the possible,” Schneider said. Matt Huber, a Purdue climate scientist who has studied the effects of clouds on climate, offered a cautious assessment of the new paper. “Whenever you see a surprising result in a climate model, you get concerned that the model is itself just too tippy, that there’s something that should be stabilizing the model,” he said. But Huber noted that the Schneider paper offers a potential answer to a long-standing riddle. For decades, scientists have known that 55 million years ago, the Earth endured a strangely hot phase — called the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). That’s the famous “crocodiles in the Arctic” period. How did Earth get so sweltering? Carbon dioxide is an obvious element of the mystery, but climate models cannot seem to nudge the planet into such high temperatures without extraordinary levels of CO2, such as 4,000 ppm or higher. And the geological record does not show CO2 higher than 2,000 ppm. So there must be another factor. One possibility has been that a massive escape of methane from the ocean floor tipped the climate into a new hothouse regime. But the Schneider paper offers another conjecture: Vanishing cloud cover could lead to a climate tipping point. Stratocumulus clouds are produced as warm air rises from the surface and cools, causing water vapor to condense. Such cloud decks are known in California as marine layers, and they are notorious for rolling into coastal cities and turning warm days cold. These clouds cover large swaths of the tropical ocean. The formation of the cloud decks depends on the cooling process at the top of the clouds. This occurs at a physical scale that traditional climate models cannot easily capture. “They simply fall through the computational mesh,” Schneider said. He and his colleagues have developed a new model that uses what is known as a large eddy simulation. The model indicates that the cooling process necessary for these cloud decks will be suppressed if the planet gets too warm.

Scientists who measure and forecast the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere said Monday that we may have passed a key turning point. Humans walking the Earth today will probably never live to see carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere once again fall below a level of 400 parts per million (ppm), at least when measured at the iconic Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, where the longest global record of Co2 has been compiled. “Our forecast supports the suggestion that the Mauna Loa record will never again show CO2 concentrations below the symbolic 400 ppm within our lifetimes,” write the researchers, led by Richard Betts of the U.K. Met Office’s Hadley Center, in Nature Climate Change. The study was conducted with colleagues from the Hadley Centre and Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the pre-industrial atmosphere were around 280 parts per million. But concentrations began to rise with the early growth of industry and continually climbed throughout the 20th century, as documented by the famous Keeling curve, based on observations taken at Mauna Loa dating back to the late 1950s. This record is referred to often as a “saw-toothed curve,” because every year, concentrations go up and down somewhat (because of the life cycles of plants across the globe, which draw in carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis). But nonetheless, the long-term trend is steadily upward because humans are putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than plants and other natural “sinks” can pull back out again. Concentrations have crossed 400 parts per million on a temporary basis. It began as brief excursions, and last year the annual average concentration at Mauna Loa was more than 400 parts per million for the first time (it was 400.9). Nonetheless, during the course of the yearly cycle in carbon dioxide concentrations, there were still some parts of the year last year when they remained below that level. What the new study suggests is that those days are over — carbon dioxide will never fall below 400 ppm this year, nor the next, nor the next. The reason is that the strong 2015-2016 El Niño event has pushed concentrations upward more than usual for a given year — El Niños tend to do that, because they dry out tropical regions, lessening tree growth and sparking vast wildfires. That means that even in September of this year, when annual concentrations are typically at their lowest (as northern hemisphere trees lose their leaves and vegetation growth declines heading into winter), they’ll likely still be slightly over 400 parts per million, scientists forecast. “I don’t think anything sort of special will happen just because we’re going past 400,” Betts said. “But I do think that these numbers are important for awareness, really. … It’s a reminder of the long-term effects we’re having on the system.” The paper also predicts that this El Niño will drive a year-to-year rise in average atmospheric concentrations of 3.15 parts per million, exceeding the single-year change caused by the last major El Niño, from 1997-1998, of 2.9 parts per million. On June 12, concentrations were at 407.26 parts per million, according to NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory, which monitors the data. But they should start to decline soon, according to the seasonal cycle, which reaches a peak in May and a low in September and is driven by the growth of plants in the northern hemisphere (where there is much more total land area). Because it presents a forecast that is naturally subject to some uncertainty, the study does note that there is still a possibility of a day this year that dips somewhat below 400 parts per million at Mauna Loa — but adds that it’s not that likely. “Daily values will be most likely to stay above 400 ppm, although values slightly below remain a small possibility,” the researchers note. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will continue to rise even though global greenhouse gas emissions from industry may be leveling off somewhat, the study adds — because each year still represents a net addition to the atmosphere, and carbon dioxide is a very long-lived greenhouse gas. Thus, even by 2050, the researchers don’t think we’ll find any way of getting back below 400 ppm. “In the longer term, a reduction in CO2 concentration would require substantial and sustained cuts in anthropogenic emissions to near zero,” they write. Barring dramatic cuts in fossil fuel emissions, combined with the development of some kind of “negative emissions” technology that actively withdraws carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, we’ll see rising carbon dioxide concentrations for some time, they note.

This story has been updated. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have spiked more in the period from February 2015 to February 2016 than in any other comparable period dating back to 1959, according to a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Earth System Research Laboratory. The change in average concentrations from February of last year to February of this year was 3.76 parts per million at the storied Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, leaving the concentration at 404.02 parts per million for February, based on preliminary data. Pieter Tans, lead scientist of NOAA’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network, confirmed that the increase, reported previously by New Scientist, represented a record year-over-year growth for Mauna Loa. He also said that in addition to the stark rise in carbon dioxide levels over the past year, researchers have now observed four straight years of increases of more than 2 parts per million in the atmosphere. “We’ve never seen that,” Tans said. “That’s unprecedented.” Indeed, the average annual increase during 2015, of 3.05 parts per million of carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa, was also the highest in the record, according to NOAA — exceeding the previous record of 2.93 parts per million in 1998, which was also a strong El Nino year. Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide were just 280 parts per million, rather than over 400 right now — and when the measurement record began at Mauna Loa in the late 1950s, were below 320 parts per million. So we have come a very long way, and very fast. Tans said the reason is very clear: Rates of fossil fuel burning remain at historically high levels, releasing 10 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere annually. “The emissions are at a record high, therefore the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 is also at a record high,” he said. However, there also appears to be a role for the El Nino phenomenon in the records this year. “CO2 tends to rise much faster during and just following El Niño events,” wrote Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography carbon dioxide program and son of Charles David Keeling (after whom the iconic graph of rising greenhouse gas concentrations is named), last October. At the time, Keeling forecast that because of the current El Nino event, we would probably never see CO2 levels decline below 400 again “in our lifetimes.” In that post, Keeling also explained why CO2 goes up so much during El Nino. It’s because of the way the phenomenon tends to drive droughts across the tropics, which in turn leads forests, like those in Indonesia, to lose carbon in wildfires — which happened at a massive scale in 2015. Drought also stunts forest growth, which leads to less carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere, Keeling wrote. “The loss of carbon from tropical forests in El Niño years is temporary as the forests tend to regrow in normal years, building back their biomass and sucking CO2 out of the air in the process,” Keeling concluded. “But the eventual recovery from this El Niño won’t bring us back below 400 ppm, because its impact will be dwarfed by the global consumption of fossil fuels, pushing CO2 levels ever higher.” Of late, the growth rate for carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere has been around 2.2 parts per million per year. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere fluctuate over the course of each year, forming a classic “saw-toothed curve” (seen above), due to the way that some parts of the Earth’s system (like trees and plants) pull more carbon out of the air during the northern hemisphere spring. That means that the level in February of this year, 404 parts per million as measured at Mauna Loa, will decline somewhat over the coming months. But overall, despite these fluctuations, the trend has been steadily upward. “Why should people be troubled by that?” Tans said. “There is no scientific doubt that higher CO2 in the atmosphere causes the inner heat balance of the Earth to change … This will have impacts on the climate.” He said the precise impacts can be difficult to pinpoint and predict, but they are unmistakable nonetheless. “What is very certain is that we do have an impact on the Earth’s climate that is risky,” he said. “We have no other home.”	562	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 312, ""text"": ""his story has been updated.

For the first time since we began to track the greenhouse gas in our planet’s atmosphere, carbon dioxide surpassed 400 parts per million in March — a concentration that scientists consider a significant milestone for Earth’s climate and our ability to reverse the trend. “We first reported 400 ppm when all of our Arctic sites reached that value in the spring of 2012,” said Pieter Tans, lead scientist of NOAA’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. “In 2013, the record at NOAA’s Mauna Loa Observatory first crossed the 400 ppm threshold. Reaching 400 parts per million as a global average is a significant milestone.” Why does a concentration of 400 ppm matter? “It’s the level that climate scientists have identified as the beginning of the danger zone,” Princeton University Prof.  Michael Oppenheimer told The Washington Post in 2014. “It means we’re probably getting to the point where we’re looking at the ‘safe zone’ in the rearview mirror, even as we’re stepping on the gas.” [In 2014, the U.N. warned of exponential CO2 growth] Global carbon dioxide concentration is higher than it has been in more than 800,000 years. That distressing fact is mainly courtesy of our current energy source of choice — the burning of fossil fuels, a process by which Earth’s carbon stores are essentially excavated from their natural position in the global carbon cycle and released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gas. The rate of that excavation and emission has been particularly staggering in recent years. “Humans burning fossil fuels have caused global carbon dioxide concentrations to rise more than 120 parts per million since pre-industrial times,” said Tans. “Half of that rise has occurred since 1980.” [The Mauna Loa Observatory record surpassed 400 ppm in 2012] NOAA, which released a statement marking the CO2 milestone  Wednesday morning, notes that the emission rate in 2014 seemed to have stalled at 2013 levels. But that was the only bright note in an otherwise somber global climate status update. “Stabilizing the rate of emissions is not enough to avert climate change,” it wrote. “NOAA data show that the average growth rate of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere from 2012 to 2014 was 2.25 ppm per year, the highest ever recorded over three consecutive years.” James Butler, director of NOAA’s Global Monitoring Division, pointed out how far we would need to go in order to see appreciable change in global carbon dioxide levels. “Elimination of about 80 percent of fossil fuel emissions would essentially stop the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” said Butler, “but concentrations of carbon dioxide would not start decreasing until even further reductions are made and then it would only do so slowly.” [Scientists say we are changing our climate in an ‘abrupt and irreversible’ way] NOAA says that global average CO2 levels are monitored at 40 different sites around the world. NOAA and their partner scientists “collect air samples in flasks while standing on cargo ship decks, on the shores of remote islands and at other locations around the world.”	561	"[{""start"": 272, ""end"": 787, ""text"": ""We first reported 400 ppm when all of our Arctic sites reached that value in the spring of 2012,” said Pieter Tans, lead scientist of NOAA’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. “In 2013, the record at NOAA’s Mauna Loa Observatory first crossed the 400 ppm threshold.

"When it comes to combating the heat-trapping greenhouse-gas emissions that are warming the globe, the United States has had something to cheer about lately. U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen enough that the country is more than halfway to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emissions pledge. But here's the bad news: Even if the United States keeps up its trend (though it could soon hit some bumps), it's barely putting a dent in global greenhouse-gas emissions. And those global emissions have helped the Earth hit some new milestones recently for the amount of these gases in the atmosphere. This new video from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences and NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory not only shows the recent global carbon-dioxide trend, but it also shows that humans have increased carbon-dioxide levels rapidly, and to their highest levels in at least 800,000 years: Our latest dubious carbon milestone Last year, for the first time in recorded history, the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide — the primary greenhouse gas that humans are emitting, mainly by burning fossil fuels — hit 400 parts per million. That may not seem like much, and 400 ppm doesn't represent a tipping point for our climate, but it's still nearly 50 percent higher than it was before industrial times began. Last year's 400-ppm breach was actually short-lived because it occurred in the spring at the peak of our planet's seasonal carbon-dioxide cycle. (Earth's plant matter is concentrated in the northern hemisphere, so global carbon-dioxide values peak in the spring, after which the summertime plant and leaf growth up north sucks out some of the carbon dioxide.) Once fall and winter come around, this trend reverses, and some carbon dioxide is let back out. Though that 400-ppm milestone was temporary last year, it’s a sign of things to come. This year, we hit 400 ppm two months earlier than last year. Not only that, but we've also had our first full month above 400 ppm in recorded history. One of the carbon-dioxide emissions curves shown in the video is particularly famous. Labeled ""Mauna Loa"" here, it's known as the Keeling curve, and it draws on measurements taken from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. You’ll see the seasonal carbon-dioxide cycle is especially marked in that curve, though the long-term upward trend wins out in the end. Think of the seasonal cycle, superimposed on the long-term trend, as being like a hill full of pine trees. Each tree's pointy shape represents the seasonal rise and fall of carbon dioxide. But each subsequent tree reaches slightly higher into the sky than the tree just below it, thanks to the upward slope of the hill. The carbon-dioxide level in the air should fall below 400 ppm again later this year as summer ramps up, but we don't have many years left until we eclipse 400 ppm for good. How much progress we still have to make on carbon-dioxide levels  One thing to keep in mind is that 400 ppm is mainly a mathematical and psychological milestone. We probably haven't hit any major tipping points by hitting 400 ppm. But the milestone still shows how close we are to hitting a more significant target from a policymaking and climatological standpoint. The United Nations has long said that the world must keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic effects, and to do that we’ll likely need to keep carbon-dioxide levels below 450 ppm (this threshold isn't exact). Note that this 450-ppm value actually includes both carbon-dioxide and carbon-dioxide-equivalent amounts of other greenhouse gases (such as methane and nitrous oxide), but other factors such as aerosol pollution are generally canceling out the effects of the non-carbon-dioxide gases, at least for now. Given the greenhouse-gas trajectory we’re on, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently said the world would need to cut its carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions by 40 to 70 percent by mid-century, and zero out these emissions by the end of the century. For comparison's sake, if we don't do anything more to cut carbon-dioxide emissions, we may reach 450 ppm by 2030. Hitting the IPCC's emissions targets won't be an easy task, as Brad Plumer noted recently, and progress internationally to secure emissions cuts has been wanting. The longer we wait, the more it will cost the economy in a given time period to meet these targets. But as the IPCC warns, it could also be very costly to do nothing."	560	"[{""start"": 920, ""end"": 1161, ""text"": ""Our latest dubious carbon milestone Last year, for the first time in recorded history, the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide — the primary greenhouse gas that humans are emitting, mainly by burning fossil fuels — hit 400 parts per million."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1162, ""end"": 1335, ""text"": ""That may not seem like much, and 400 ppm doesn't represent a tipping point for our climate, but it's still nearly 50 percent higher than it was before industrial times began"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1162, ""end"": 1335, ""text"": ""hat may not seem like much, and 400 ppm doesn't represent a tipping point for our climate, but it's still nearly 50 percent higher than it was before industrial times began"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 3247, ""end"": 3476, ""text"": ""The United Nations has long said that the world must keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic effects, and to do that we’ll likely need to keep carbon-dioxide levels below 450 ppm (this threshold isn't exact)"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3780, ""end"": 4167, ""text"": ""Given the greenhouse-gas trajectory we’re on, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently said the world would need to cut its carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions by 40 to 70 percent by mid-century, and zero out these emissions by the end of the century.

For the first time in human history, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached 400 parts per million (ppm). The arrival at this threshold represents a powerful symbol of the growing human influence on the Earth’s climate. Manmade emissions of carbon dioxide have increased the atmospheric concentration of CO2 from around 270 to 280 ppm in the late 1700s to today’s record high level – a 43 percent increase. Measurements of CO2 trapped in air bubbles from ice cores in Antarctica indicate today’s levels are unsurpassed in at least 800,000 years. “[The] increase is not a surprise to scientists,” said NOAA senior scientist Pieter Tans. “The evidence is conclusive that the strong growth of global CO2 emissions from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas is driving the acceleration.” Global CO2 emissions soared to a record high of 35.6 billion tonnes in 2012, up 2.6 percent from 2011 according to Climate Central’s Andrew Freedman. The rising concentrations of carbon dioxide, in response to these emissions, have been monitored at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii since 1958. They have been plotted on the iconic Keeling Curve, named after scientist Charles David Keeling, who initiated the measurements. At that time, the CO2 concentration was just 316 ppm. It’s possible the current CO2 levels haven’t been matched in millions of years.  Scripps Institution of Oceanography estimates the last time the concentration was at least 400 ppm occurred 5 to 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch. Carbon dioxide is a heat trapping greenhouse gas and its inexorable rise in recent history coupled with an increase in the Earth’s temperature raise concerns about human interference with the climate system and where temperatures and sea levels may be headed. During the Pliocene Epoch, temperatures were 5-7 degrees F warmer than today and sea levels were many feet higher, Scripps says. “There’s no guarantee that we’d experience the same levels of warming in the future if CO2 levels stay that high, but it doesn’t look good,” writes Time magazine’s Bryan Walsh. “Nor will CO2 levels stop at 400 ppm—barring a virtually impossible immediate turn away from fossil fuels, CO2 emissions will keep growing globally, and CO2 concentrations will keep rising.” * * * Here’s a nice infographic from Climate Central See also, this well-done Climate Central piece: The Last Time CO2 Was This High, Humans Didn’t Exist	559	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 244, ""text"": ""For the first time in human history, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached 400 parts per million (ppm).

"Humans are warming the planet. Scientists are 95 percent sure of this — as sure as they are that cigarette smoking causes cancer. That's one takeaway from the big new climate report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which began rolling out Friday. The major report synthesizes the vast array of climate science research out there. Humans have pushed temperatures higher by burning fossil fuels and clearing forests, the report says. If we keep producing heat-trapping greenhouse gases, that will lead to much more ice melt and higher sea levels in the decades ahead. None of this is too surprising. Climate scientists have known that humans are warming the planet for many years — their confidence has gone up, but the conclusion has stayed the same. Even so, it's worth reading through the summary of the IPCC report to see what else the climate panel has to say. There are some new details here, including the critical point that humans will have to keep the vast majority of their fossil-fuel reserves in the ground if we want to keep global warming below 2ºC, the level deemed ""dangerous"" by world leaders. 1) Humans are in control of how much the planet will heat up in the decades ahead. We can choose 1ºC (or less) of global warming. Or we can choose a drastic 4ºC. the recent slowdown But human influences on the climate are becoming increasingly dominant. ""By the mid-21st century, the magnitudes of the projected changes are substantially affected by the choice of emissions scenario,"" the IPCC report says. In other words, how hot the Earth gets will depend on how much carbon-dioxide we put into the atmosphere. In the chart above, the report shows how hot the Earth is likely to get under different emissions scenarios. If we managed to cut global emissions drastically — that's the blue line — we have a decent shot at keeping global warming below 1ºC. But if emissions keep rising unchecked — the red line — then temperatures could rise around 4ºC (or 7.2ºF). 2) Humans can only burn about one-sixth of their fossil fuel reserves if they want to keep global warming below 2ºC. For years now, world leaders have agreed that 2ºC is the level of “dangerous” global warming that humanity should avoid. The new IPCC report says we have to keep the vast majority of our oil, gas, and coal in the ground if we want to reach that goal. The math is pretty straightforward: Humans have already emitted about 531 billion tons of carbon since the Industrial Revolution, by clearing forests and burning fossil fuels. And, scientists calculate, we can only emit another 469 billion tons or so if we want a good shot at keeping global warming below 2ºC. We're currently on pace to do that by 2040. So how can we stay below 2ºC? Currently, the world has an estimated 3 trillion tons or so of carbon locked away in known oil, gas, and coal reserves. So we would only be able to burn about one-sixth of our remaining fossil fuels. The rest would have to stay in the ground. That's a daunting prospect. (For those interested, Kelly Levin of the World Resources Institute has much, much more detail on these numbers, and many thanks to her for these calculations.) 3) The oceans will keep rising even if humans stop emitting carbon tomorrow. But we can choose between medium sea-level rise or drastic sea-level rise. We've already warmed the planet enough to heat and expand the oceans and lock in some melting of land ice. So even if we do curtail emissions dramatically — again, that's the blue line — we can expect some sea-level rise in the decades ahead, possibly half a meter by the end of the century, and continuing thereafter. But if we keep emitting greenhouse gases at our current pace, then sea-level rise gets even more drastic. The IPCC is projecting up to a meter of sea-level rise by century's end if emissions stay unchecked — that's the red line. Oceans would continue to rise for centuries thereafter. By the way, the report points out that some models project even higher sea-level rise than one meter by centuries end. These are so-called ""semi-empirical"" models that have had some success, but don't actually model physical processes. The IPCC doesn't rule out these higher projections, but it can't assess their reliability. 4) Using geoengineering to cool the planet is fraught with risks. In recent years, some scientists have despaired of the idea that humans will ever cut their greenhouse-gas emissions and have looked to ""geoengineering"" schemes that could artificially cool the planet. One such idea is to sprinkle sulfate particles into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight. (Volcanic eruptions can lower global temperatures by a similar process.) The IPCC, however, thinks that this idea does carry some risks, like mucking with global patterns of rainfall. If, for some reason, the geoengineering process was ever halted, temperatures would rise very rapidly: Methods that aim to deliberately alter the climate system to counter climate change, termed geoengineering, have been proposed. Limited evidence precludes a comprehensive quantitative assessment of both Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and their impact on the climate system. CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on a global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. Modelling indicates that SRM methods, if realizable, have the potential to substantially offset a global temperature rise, but they would also modify the global water cycle, and would not reduce ocean acidification. If SRM were terminated for any reason, there is high confidence that global surface temperatures would rise very rapidly to values consistent with the greenhouse gas forcing. CDR and SRM methods carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. So even a last-resort fix to climate change might have unintended consequences. * Here's a good primer on what the IPCC is and what it's releasing. Note that only the ""summary for policymakers"" is coming out today (here), with the full 2,000-page scientific report on climate science released Monday. In the months to follow, the IPCC will also release separate reports on the human impacts of climate change and a look at the world's energy system.

The latest review of climate science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), though not finalized, is making the rounds.  The prevailing headline is that the panel is more certain than ever that most of the warming observed in recent decades is human-caused.  It’s level of certainty has increased from at least 90 percent in 2007 to at least 95 percent in the new report. Officials from the IPCC stress that the leaked draft is not its final product.  A government review is ongoing, so some of the conclusions may be altered.  But here are some of the more interesting preliminary findings…. 1) The recent rate of increase in carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is unprecedented in the last 22,000 years. 2) Glaciers worldwide shrunk 22 percent faster from 1993-2009 compared to the longer period from 1971-2009. 3) The Greenland Ice Sheet lost mass about 6 times faster between 2002-2011 compared to the period from 1992-2001. 4) The Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass nearly 5 times faster between 2002-2011 compared to the period from 1992-2001. 5) Sea level rise from 1901 to 2010 occurred at a rate of 1.7 millimeters per year and increased to 3.2 millimeters per year between 1993 and 2010. 6) Arctic sea ice extent decreased at a rate of 3.5 to 4.1 percent per decade from 1979-2012. 7) The 30 years from 1983-2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years. 8) The global average temperature is projected to warm by (an average of) 2 to 7  degrees F by 2100, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions and climate sensitivity. 9) The global average sea level is projected to rise by (an average of) 16 to 24 inches by 2100, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions and climate sensitivity. 10)  It is very likely that more than 20 percent of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere will remain there over 20,000 years after emissions stop. This is just a sprinkling of some of the findings – focused on observed and projected changes in temperature, ice sheets and sea level. When the report is finalized, I’ll provide a closer look…	557	"[{""start"": 141, ""end"": 390, ""text"": ""The prevailing headline is that the panel is more certain than ever that most of the warming observed in recent decades is human-caused.  It’s level of certainty has increased from at least 90 percent in 2007 to at least 95 percent in the new report"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 616, ""end"": 749, ""text"": ""The recent rate of increase in carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is unprecedented in the last 22,000 years."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 753, ""end"": 856, ""text"": ""Glaciers worldwide shrunk 22 percent faster from 1993-2009 compared to the longer period from 1971-2009"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 861, ""end"": 971, ""text"": ""The Greenland Ice Sheet lost mass about 6 times faster between 2002-2011 compared to the period from 1992-2001"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 976, ""end"": 1087, ""text"": ""he Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass nearly 5 times faster between 2002-2011 compared to the period from 1992-2001"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1092, ""end"": 1235, ""text"": ""Sea level rise from 1901 to 2010 occurred at a rate of 1.7 millimeters per year and increased to 3.2 millimeters per year between 1993 and 201"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1240, ""end"": 1329, ""text"": ""Arctic sea ice extent decreased at a rate of 3.5 to 4.1 percent per decade from 1979-2012"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1334, ""end"": 1427, ""text"": ""The 30 years from 1983-2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1431, ""end"": 1598, ""text"": ""he global average temperature is projected to warm by (an average of) 2 to 7  degrees F by 2100, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions and climate sensitivity."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1602, ""end"": 1764, ""text"": ""The global average sea level is projected to rise by (an average of) 16 to 24 inches by 2100, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions and climate sensitivity"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1771, ""end"": 1919, ""text"": ""t is very likely that more than 20 percent of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere will remain there over 20,000 years after emissions stop."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 141, ""end"": 390, ""text"": ""The prevailing headline is that the panel is more certain than ever that most of the warming observed in recent decades is human-caused.  It’s level of certainty has increased from at least 90 percent in 2007 to at least 95 percent in the new report"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	536	2023-04-11T21:51:39.793579Z	2023-04-11T21:51:39.793647Z	156.673
With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles. Sea level ranged between five and 40 meters (16 to 131 feet) higher than today. The Pliocene is not strictly comparable to our current era, and there are still questions about why that period was as warm as it was, but it's thought to be a useful historical guide. Here's a little more detail about what conditions were like at the time: As for what life was like then, scientists rely on fossil records to recreate where plants and animals lived and in what quantity. Pliocene fossil records show that the climate was generally warmer and wetter than today. ... The absence of significant ocean upwelling in the warmest part of the Pliocene would have suppressed fisheries along the west coasts of the Americas, and deprived seabirds and marine mammals of food supplies.  Reef corals suffered a major extinction during the peak of Pliocene warmth but reefs themselves did not disappear. Keep in mind, too, that the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide during the Pliocene era was a very gradual process over many thousands of years, caused by subtle changes in the Earth's orbit. Today, carbon dioxide is rising much more rapidly, largely due to fossil-fuel burning and land-use changes. Climatologists argue that speed will make a big difference: Richard Norris, a geologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, said the concentration of CO2 is one means of comparison, but what is not comparable, and more significant, is the speed at which 400 ppm is being surpassed today. “I think it is likely that all these ecosystem changes could recur, even though the time scales for the Pliocene warmth are different than the present,” Norris said.  “The main lagging indicator is likely to be sea level just because it takes a long time to heat the ocean and a long time to melt ice. But our dumping of heat and CO2 into the ocean is like making investments in a pollution ‘bank,’ since we can put heat and CO2 in the ocean, but we will only extract the results (more sea-level rise from thermal expansion and more acidification) over the next several thousand years.  And we cannot easily withdraw either the heat or the CO2 from the ocean if we actually get our act together and try to limit our industrial pollution–the ocean keeps what we put in it.” One final point: Humanity is all but certain to zoom past 400 parts per million. The big question is, how far past? For a long time, many climate experts thought we should aim to stabilize atmospheric carbon to about 450 parts per million. That goal looks daunting now. At the current rate, the world will pass that mark within a few decades. Indeed, even the most optimistic analyses of current trends, like this one from the International Energy Agency, which predicts that natural gas will displace coal, see us hitting at least 650 parts per million without drastic changes.

Since 1956, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has been gathering data on how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere — a very basic measure of how humans are transforming the planet and setting the stage for future climate change. The so-called Keeling Curve is attracting even more attention than usual this month, as the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is on the verge of hitting 400 parts per million, a new milestone (the readings hit 399.71 on Tuesday): Notice that the curve is jagged. As humans keep burning fossil fuels, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has trended upward over time. But there are still seasonal fluctuations. When trees in the Northern Hemisphere bloom in the spring and summer, they absorb some of that carbon. When the leaves wilt in the winter, carbon returns to the air and readings spike. The curve is a record of the planet's breathing. As such, even if Mauna Loa does register levels above 400 parts per million this May, it will prove temporary. The readings will drop again this summer by a few parts per million, and it will likely be a few years before levels remain above 400 ppm all year. But in an important sense, this year's milestone is beside the point. For decades now, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years — a fact scientists discovered by analyzing ancient air bubbles trapped in ice cores: In fact, even that's probably an understatement. Recent studies have estimated that current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are at their highest levels since the Pliocene, the geologic era between five million and three million years ago. Here's a description of that era from the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography: Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. 	555	"[{""start"": 496, ""end"": 611, ""text"": "".

Human influence on the Earth’s atmosphere touched what climate scientists called a dire milestone Friday as concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide nudged up to a level unseen in about 3 million to 5 million years — long before modern humans. A monitoring station in Hawaii recorded carbon dioxide concentrations of 400 parts per million Friday, dramatically up from the 316 parts per million recorded when the station made its first measurements in 1958. The monitor, high atop the Mauna Loa volcano, offers the longest-running record of atmospheric carbon dioxide measured directly from the air. Carbon dioxide is a primary greenhouse gas, efficient at trapping heat from the sun. The colorless gas is released from power plants and vehicles as they burn coal, oil and gas. “[The] increase is not a surprise to scientists,” said Pieter Tans, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The evidence is conclusive that the strong growth of global [carbon dioxide] emissions from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving the acceleration.” Climate scientist Joanna Haigh of Imperial College London said the particular figure reached Friday — 400 parts per million — holds no particular significance except as a milestone. “It gives us the chance to mark the ongoing increase in [carbon dioxide] concentration and talk about why it’s a problem for the climate.” Scientists have firmly linked rising atmospheric carbon dioxide to higher global temperatures, which have increased nearly a degree Fahrenheit, on average, since 1950. Larger temperature increases have occurred in the Arctic. In 2009, an international agreement sought to limit temperature increases to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100 to avoid catastrophic effects on the climate. Estimates from the 1700s show atmospheric carbon dioxide at about 270 parts per million — about 40 percent lower than today. Air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice cores show that, in the past 800,000 years, airborne concentrations remained lower than 400 parts per million. And scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and elsewhere have estimated that about 3 million to 5 million years have passed since so much carbon dioxide wafted in the Earth’s atmosphere. The temperature during that period, known as the Pliocene Epoch, was 5 to 7 degrees warmer than today, with seas tens of feet higher. Airborne concentrations of carbon dioxide vary by season and location on Earth. But the measurements from the Mauna Loa monitor, which is run by Scripps, are considered the gold standard. Concentrations there are plotted on the iconic Keeling Curve, named after scientist Charles David Keeling, who initiated the measurements in 1958. At that time, the carbon dioxide level was 316 parts per million. Concentrations of the gas have been rising steadily since — a reflection of the world’s fossil fuel economy. In 2012, global carbon dioxide emissions soared to a record high of 35.6 billion tons, up 2.6 percent from 2011.	554	"[{""start"": 55, ""end"": 248, ""text"": ""climate scientists called a dire milestone Friday as concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide nudged up to a level unseen in about 3 million to 5 million years — long before modern humans"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1411, ""end"": 1578, ""text"": ""Scientists have firmly linked rising atmospheric carbon dioxide to higher global temperatures, which have increased nearly a degree Fahrenheit, on average, since 1950."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1579, ""end"": 1644, ""text"": ""Larger temperature increases have occurred in the Arctic.

Levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose at a record-shattering pace last year, a new report shows, a surge that surprised scientists and spurred fears of an accelerated warming of the planet in decades to come. Concentrations of nearly all the major greenhouse gases reached historic highs in 2013, reflecting ever-rising emissions from automobiles and smokestacks but also, scientists believe, a diminishing ability of the world’s oceans and plant life to soak up the excess carbon put into the atmosphere by humans, according to data released early Tuesday by the United Nations’ meteorological advisory body. The latest figures from the World Meteorological Organization’s monitoring network are considered particularly significant because they reflect not only the amount of carbon pumped into the air by humans, but also the complex interaction between man-made gases and the natural world. Historically, about half of the pollution from human sources has been absorbed by the oceans and by terrestrial plants, preventing temperatures from rising as quickly as they otherwise would, scientists say. “If the oceans and the biosphere cannot absorb as much carbon, the effect on the atmosphere could be much worse,” said Oksana Tarasova, a scientist and chief of the WMO’s Global Atmospheric Watch program, which collects data from 125 monitoring stations worldwide. The monitoring network is regarded as the most reliable window on the health of Earth’s atmosphere, drawing on air samples collected near the poles, over the oceans, and in other locations far from cities and other major sources of pollution. The new figures for carbon dioxide were particularly surprising, showing the biggest year-over-year increase since detailed records were first compiled in the 1980s, Tarasova said in an interview. The jump of nearly three parts per million over 2012 levels was twice as large as the average increase in carbon levels in recent decades, she said. “The changes we’re seeing are really drastic,” Tarasova said. “We are seeing the growth rate rising exponentially.” The organization’s annual report on greenhouse gas levels was released ahead of a climate summit of world leaders at this year’s U.N. General Assembly meetings in New York. On Sept. 23, President Obama will meet with chief executives from dozens of other countries to discuss ways to lower industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases blamed for heating up the planet. Natural carbon dioxide is an essential ingredient for life on Earth, enabling green plants to convert sunlight into energy. But at excessive levels it acts as a heat trap, causing the planet to warm. Scientists say that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been rising since the start of the Industrial Revolution and that the increase has accelerated since the 1990s. The WMO’s data for 2013 shows the global average level of atmospheric carbon at just under 400 parts per million, about 40 percent higher than in ­pre-industrial times and higher than in any other period in at least 800,000 years. The symbolically important threshold of 400 parts per million — described by scientists as the level at which more dramatic climactic impacts become likely — will probably be crossed in the next two years, the report said. “It’s the level that climate scientists have identified as the beginning of the danger zone,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University professor of geosciences who was not involved in the WMO report. “It means we’re probably getting to the point where we’re looking at the ‘safe zone’ in the rearview mirror, even as we’re stepping on the gas.” A landmark report last year by a U.N.-appointed panel of climate scientists warned that, if current trends continue, the world could soon see major disruptions to both natural ecosystems and human civilization, including rising sea levels that could swamp many of the world’s coastal cities. That report, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, projected a rise in temperatures of up to nine degrees in the next century unless action is taken to lower carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Methane, another major greenhouse gas, also rose significantly in the WMO’s latest report, continuing a steady climb that began six years ago. Global concentrations of methane — a byproduct of farming and fossil-fuel extraction, as well as numerous natural processes — are now 21 / 2 times as high as they were at the start of the industrial age, in the mid-18th century, the report said. The organization’s annual report included, for the first time, figures on the increasing acidification of the oceans stemming from higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As the seas absorb more carbon dioxide from the air, the water’s chemical composition becomes more acidic. Studies extrapolating from the fossil record suggest that the rate of acidification is now “unprecedented, at least over the past 300,000 years,” the WMO said. Higher acidity in seawater is known to disrupt the life cycles of many marine species — from reef-building corals to shellfish beloved by humans — by interfering with the creatures’ ability to use sea-borne calcium to build their shells. In an indirect way, the acidification of seawater also exacerbates climate change: The oceans over time become less capable of absorbing carbon from the air, allowing more of the greenhouse gas to accumulate in the atmosphere, the report said.

Over the weekend, the climate system sounded simultaneous alarms. Near the entrance to the Arctic Ocean in northwest Russia, the temperature surged to 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius). Meanwhile, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eclipsed 415 parts per million for the first time in human history. By themselves, these are just data points. But taken together with so many indicators of an altered atmosphere and rising temperatures, they blend into the unmistakable portrait of human-induced climate change. Saturday’s steamy 84-degree reading was posted in Arkhangelsk, Russia, where the average high temperature is around 54 this time of year. The city of 350,000 people sits next to the White Sea, which feeds into the Arctic Ocean’s Barents Sea. In Koynas, a rural area to the east of Arkhangelsk, it was even hotter on Sunday, soaring to 87 degrees (31 Celsius). Many locations in Russia, from the Kazakhstan border to the White Sea, set record-high temperatures over the weekend, some 30 to 40 degrees (around 20 Celsius) above average. The warmth also bled west into Finland, which hit 77 degrees (25 Celsius) Saturday, the country’s warmest temperature of the season so far. The abnormally warm conditions in this region stemmed from a bulging zone of high pressure centered over western Russia. This particular heat wave, while a manifestation of the arrangement of weather systems and fluctuations in the jet stream, fits into what has been an unusually warm year across the Arctic and most of the mid-latitudes. In Greenland, for example, the ice sheet’s melt season began about a month early. In Alaska, several rivers saw winter ice break up on their earliest dates on record. Across the Arctic overall, the extent of sea ice has hovered near a record low for weeks. Data from the Japan Meteorological Agency show April was the second warmest on record for the entire planet. These changes all have occurred against the backdrop of unremitting increases in carbon dioxide, which has now crossed another symbolic threshold. Saturday’s carbon dioxide measurement of 415 parts per million at Hawaii’s Mauna Loa Observatory is the highest in at least 800,000 years and probably over 3 million years. Carbon dioxide levels have risen by nearly 50 percent since the Industrial Revolution. The clip at which carbon dioxide has built up in the atmosphere has risen in recent years. Ralph Keeling, director of the program that monitors the gas at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, tweeted that its accumulation in the last year is “on the high end.” Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that, along with the rise of several other such heat-trapping gases, is the primary cause of climate warming in recent decades, scientists have concluded. Eighteen of the 19 warmest years on record for the planet have occurred since 2000, and we keep observing these highly unusual and often record-breaking high temperatures. They won’t stop soon, but cuts to greenhouse emissions would eventually slow them down.

As world leaders grapple with how to cut global emissions of carbon dioxide, diplomats in Paris are recording progress in combating other pollutants that scientists believe are contributing powerfully to rising temperatures. A coalition of governments and private businesses has agreed to take up a series of initiatives to limit so-called “short-lived climate pollutants,” ranging from industrial chemicals used in refrigerators to soot particles given off by diesel engines. While emissions of these pollutants are small compared to carbon dioxide, some are vastly more powerful, pound for pound, in trapping heat in the Earth’s lower atmosphere. Participants in the efforts say controlling these pollutants could offer a way to slow global warming in the coming decades while giving scientists and policymakers more time to tackle the bigger challenge of curbing carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. “This will produce the biggest single piece of climate mitigation in the near term and avoid a half degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century,” Durwood Zaelke, founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development and an expert in international environmental law, told a news conference Friday at the Paris climate talks. In fighting climate change, “speed matters profoundly,” he said. Short-lived climate pollutants are so named because they dissipate relatively quickly in the environment — in years or decades, compared to hundreds or thousands of years for carbon dioxide. They include methane, a naturally occurring gas that is also given off in large quantities by oil and gas operations, farms and landfills; common industrial coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs; and “black carbon,” which consists mostly of soot particles. When black carbon settles on snow and ice it darkens the surface, drawing more heat from the sun and causing faster melting. On Friday, officials in Paris announced plans to broaden the Green Freight Action Plan, a coalition of 20 countries and several major corporations, including Volvo and Hewlett Packard, to reduce diesel soot from the transportation sector, especially heavy trucks and cargo ships. Separately, a business group called the Global Food Cold Chain Council announced new steps to cut back on the use of HFCs in commercial and industrial refrigeration. Dozens of U.S. companies are already participating in voluntary measures to speed up the shift from HFCs to alternative chemicals that are safer for the environment. Last month, more than 190 nations agreed in principle to scale back global production of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, the 1989 accord that banned production of chemicals that damage the Earth’s ozone layer. Details are to be finalized at an international conference in Dubai next year. “This collaboration is an excellent example of what can be accomplished when all parties work together in good faith to achieve a common goal,”  said Stephen Yurek, president of the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, the U.S. trade association representing refrigerant producers and air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment manufacturers. Multiple efforts already are underway to limit methane, which currently accounts for about 25 percent of the greenhouse-gas problem, experts say. Environmental and industry groups have launched initiatives to cut down on leaks of methane gas from oil and gas fields, the single biggest source of man-made emissions. Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said reducing such leaks offers a fast way to gain ground in the fight against climate change. “The higher temperatures get in the short run, the more likely it is that we are going to pass a trigger point that leads to runaway warming,” Krupp said. Cutting methane leaks “gives us an opportunity to minimize that risk,” he said.	551	"[{""start"": 1321, ""end"": 1510, ""text"": ""Short-lived climate pollutants are so named because they dissipate relatively quickly in the environment — in years or decades, compared to hundreds or thousands of years for carbon dioxide"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	530	2023-04-11T21:08:29.398000Z	2023-04-11T21:08:29.398098Z	214.609
In a groundbreaking climate change study, scientists have found that by neglecting to include the melting of Antarctica, we have vastly underestimated the potential for sea level rise over the next 80 years — and beyond. The most widely cited estimate of around three feet by 2100 includes sea level rise from thermal expansion (water expands when it warms) and the melting of smaller glaciers. It includes minimal contributions from Greenland and Antarctica. Instead, this study published in the journal Nature suggests that we should actually double that forecast when we include melting in Antarctica: approximately six feet of sea level rise by 2100. Just as alarming is the projection that Antarctica by itself could add 50 feet of sea level rise by 2500. What does that even look like? The 50-foot estimate is hard to imagine. The study essentially concludes that we could alter the face of the Earth over the next 100 to 500 years. In the study’s projection for 2500, almost the entire state of Delaware would disappear. Much of Manhattan and Brooklyn would be reduced to just slivers of their current selves. The southern coast of Florida would end north of Lake Okeechobee. California’s Central Valley would flood from Modesto to Colusa, and the state capital of Sacramento would be entirely under water. And this says nothing about the millions — billions? — of people who could be displaced around the globe. It’s a little easier to picture the 2100 projection, which, if this study is correct, would significantly change coastlines in the United States. Each of these maps was created by the research team at Climate Central. You can explore more coastlines in the interactive viewer. Climate Central used the highest resolution elevation maps available to create these projections. The researchers take into account the mitigating effects of levees, under the assumption that all levees will be able to withstand the pressure of rising seas (despite the fact that only 8 percent of the monitored levees in the United States are considered in “acceptable” condition). The outcomes range from dire in places such as Miami and New Orleans to avoidable with mitigation strategies in Washington, D.C. Most important to remember when scanning these images is that they still do not include the potentially significant sea level rise from Greenland. Miami New Orleans Tampa San Francisco Boston Washington, D.C. These sea level rise projections were created using the IPCC’s “business as usual” scenario, though there is certainly a caveat to this assumption. It seems unlikely we will be able to maintain everything that comes along with the business as usual scenario: high population growth, little improvement in energy efficiency, no policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and a continued, heavy reliance on fossil fuels. However, none of the scenarios — low or high emissions — take into account things that are not well-understood, such as the effect of melting permafrost, which in itself has the ability to inject large amounts of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. The portrait it paints is a worst-case scenario for how our planet could look if we continue today’s actions and policies unabated — or if we have simply underestimated how much greenhouse gas is entering the atmosphere. Either way, it’s an important potential outcome to examine, if only to serve as motivation to reduce fossil fuel emissions sooner rather than later.	550	"[{""start"": 655, ""end"": 759, ""text"": ""Just as alarming is the projection that Antarctica by itself could add 50 feet of sea level rise by 2500"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 939, ""end"": 1313, ""text"": ""In the study’s projection for 2500, almost the entire state of Delaware would disappear.

New scientific data released on Monday confirmed 2015’s place as a milestone year for the Earth’s environment, with both temperatures and greenhouse gases crossing symbolic thresholds with ominous implications for future climate change. The World Meteorological Organization, in an annual accounting of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, reported that average levels of carbon dioxide exceeded 400 parts per million in the early months of 2015, a rise of 43 percent over pre-industrial levels. And, in a separate report hours later, the Met Office and Climatic Research Unit at Britain’s University of East Anglia reported that the Earth’s average temperature has crossed the symbolically important 1-degree C (1.8 F) mark, with temperatures over the first nine months of the year exceeding historic norms by exactly 1.02 degrees C. The reports are likely to add to concerns about global warming in a year that climate experts say is almost certain to surpass 2014 as the hottest year in recorded history. “We are moving into unchartered territory at a frightening speed,” WMO Secretary General Michel Jarraud said of the report’s findings. The WMO maintains the world’s biggest network of sensors detecting changes in the makeup of the Earth’s atmosphere. For decades it has tracked rising concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring chemical compound that is vital for plant life and also acts as an insulating blanket, trapping the sun’s heat and making the planet warmer than it would otherwise be. With the burning of fossil fuels, levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide have risen steadily, soaring from about 278 ppm during ­pre-industrial times to above 390 ppm by the start of the current decade. Many scientists contend that the carbon dioxide levels should remain well below 400 ppm to avoid long-term disruptions to the Earth’s climate. But since 2012, several of the WMO’s 125 individual monitoring stations have detected readings above that threshold. The global average climbed to 397.7 ppm in 2014, the WMO report said, and then, in early 2015, it exceeded 400 ppm for the first time since record-keeping began, the organization's data shows. The level then dipped, as usual, with the arrival of the spring growing season in the Northern Hemisphere, when trees and other plants take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. But WMO officials say the planetary average is expected to remain above 400 parts per million beginning in 2016. “We will soon be living with globally averaged CO2 levels above 400 parts per million as a permanent reality,” Jarraud said. The long-term implications for the planet, he said, include “hotter global temperatures and more extreme weather events,” as well as melting ice, rising sea levels and increased acidity in oceans. “It is an invisible threat, but a very real one,” he said. The WMO report, an annual compilation of monitoring data from the organization’s Global Atmospheric Watch program, shows carbon dioxide concentrations rising by 0.5 percent from 2013 to 2014, roughly on par with the average annual increase over the past decade. But two other key greenhouse gases — methane and nitrous oxide — appear to be increasing at a fast rate, the report said. Methane increased by 9 parts per billion from 2013 to 2014, compared with an average annual increase of 4.7 ppb, the report said. The combined radiative “forcing” from all these gases — essentially the warming effect on the planet — has now risen by 36 percent since 1990, the report said. It said consequences will continue to be felt for centuries, since new emissions of carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere for that long.. The East Anglia report confirming the 1-degree temperature rise is new evidence of “unequivocal warming” of the Earth, said Peter Stott, head of the climate monitoring and attribution team at the British University. U.S. climate scientists say the planet is on track to break last year’s heat record — a near-certainty in the light of this year’s unusual “El Niño” weather pattern in the Pacific. “As the world continues to warm in the coming decades, however, we will see more and more years passing the 1 degree marker — eventually it will become the norm,” Stott said. The release of the reports comes three weeks before the start of international negotiations in Paris on a proposed treaty to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases. Diplomats from more than 190 countries are expected to participate in the talks, which are intended to put the planet on a path toward capping and then reducing carbon pollution. The Obama administration has pledged to reduce U.S. emissions by up to 28 percent by the year 2030, compared with the baseline year of 2005.
