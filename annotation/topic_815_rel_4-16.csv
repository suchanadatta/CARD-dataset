The State Department has no new information on the whereabouts or welfare of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, detained two weeks ago in Iran, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday. “We remain concerned about his detention in Iran,” along with others seized July 22, Psaki said. “Our focus is on doing everything possible to secure the safe return and release of Mr. Rezaian and the others detained with him,” Psaki said. “We, of course, call on the Iranian government and continue to call on the Iranian government to immediately release him and the other individuals.” Rezaian was arrested with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, and two other people. One was released but the others remain jailed and have not been heard from. Iran has announced no charges. The names of the others arrested with Rezaian and Salehi have not been made widely public, but Psaki noted that both Rezaian and the third person held hold dual citizenship. The State Department has requested access to Rezaian and the other dual national, working through Switzerland, which has acted as an intermediary since the rupture of U.S.-Iranian diplomatic relations following the 1979 revolution. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, considering those who hold it to be Iranian only, and thus routinely denies such requests for jail visits by the Swiss. Psaki said there was no update to report on the Swiss request, indicating that Iran has either denied the request or has not responded. Psaki also said she could not corroborate or refute media reports on Monday that a caretaker or doorman at Rezaian’s apartment building died after an altercation with Iranian security agents seeking Rezaian’s arrest. “We, of course, have seen the reports that an individual in Mr. Rezaian’s building died from injuries sustained” at the time of the arrest, Psaki said. “We don't have any further information or confirmation of those reports.” The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a question about the veracity of those reports or queries about Rezaian’s whereabouts or status. Iran has periodically arrested dual nationals visiting or working in Iran, in some cases holding them for many months. Asked Tuesday about the United States’ continued negotiations with Iran while it holds Americans, Psaki said the matters are separate. The talks, which will resume within a month, are aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.	163	"[{""start"": 743, ""end"": 773, ""text"": ""Iran has announced no charges."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1478, ""end"": 1693, ""text"": ""Psaki also said she could not corroborate or refute media reports on Monday that a caretaker or doorman at Rezaian’s apartment building died after an altercation with Iranian security agents seeking Rezaian’s arres"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1478, ""end"": 1693, ""text"": ""Psaki also said she could not corroborate or refute media reports on Monday that a caretaker or doorman at Rezaian’s apartment building died after an altercation with Iranian security agents seeking Rezaian’s arres"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	173	2023-03-22T14:53:02.712661Z	2023-03-22T14:53:02.712763Z	227.215
Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post correspondent who has been held captive by the Iranian government for more than 500 days, was granted a small reprieve Friday when his captors allowed a Christmas Day visit from his wife and mother. “After several efforts, Yegi and I were able to secure permission from the court to meet with Jason for several hours today, Christmas,” Rezaian’s mother, Mary, said in an email to The Post. Yegi is Rezaian’s wife, Yeganeh Salehi, an Iranian citizen who is a correspondent for the National, a newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates. “This is the first time in the year that I have been visiting him in Evin Prison that I could spend an extended time there and bring him his first home-cooked meal in months,” Mary Rezaian said in her email. “We had a wonderful time together reminiscing of holidays past.” The Post correspondent earlier this month marked more than 500 days in captivity. That’s longer than the 52 U.S. Embassy personnel who were held captive from November 1979 to January 1981. Rezaian, 39, was born in California and holds both U.S. and Iranian citizenships. He was quietly convicted in closed proceedings earlier this year after being charged with espionage and related allegations. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron issued the following statement: “We are enormously pleased that our colleague Jason was permitted to spend extended time with his mother, Mary, and his wife, Yegi. It is a happy occasion for them and for all of us. And yet, we have to note, this visit is a rare exception in the 522 days of tragic, unjust imprisonment of a good, honorable and innocent man. “We welcome this act of basic humanity, and we encourage his jailers in Iran to follow up by doing all that justice and decency require: Release Jason from prison and allow him a return to life as a free man who can spend time with his family where and whenever he pleases.” Rezaian is being held in Evin Prison, which houses a number of high-profile political prisoners. A spokesman for Iran’s judiciary last month confirmed that a prison sentence was handed down in a statement on the state Islamic Republic News Agency’s website, according to the Associated Press. The length of the sentence has not been disclosed publicly. Mary Rezaian’s email included a message from her son: “Jason wants all his colleagues at The Post, the advertising department, cartoonists, everyone including the janitors to know how very much he appreciates their efforts, support and goodwill. He knows you all are working harder than any other entity to secure his release. And the knowledge of that is what gives him strength every day. “Jason is sending his warmest nondenominational season’s greetings to everyone at The Post and wishes for a very happy and productive new year.”	162	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 232, ""text"": ""Rezaian, The Washington Post correspondent who has been held captive by the Iranian government for more than 500 days, was granted a small reprieve Friday when his captors allowed a Christmas Day visit from his wife and mother"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1116, ""end"": 1239, ""text"": ""He was quietly convicted in closed proceedings earlier this year after being charged with espionage and related allegations"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1920, ""end"": 2015, ""text"": ""Rezaian is being held in Evin Prison, which houses a number of high-profile political prisoners"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1116, ""end"": 1240, ""text"": ""He was quietly convicted in closed proceedings earlier this year after being charged with espionage and related allegations."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	172	2023-03-22T14:49:12.773038Z	2023-03-22T14:49:12.773130Z	230.04
The following is a statement from independent United Nations experts calling for the immediate release of Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, who is awaiting a verdict in Iranian court. Read the full story here. GENEVA (14 August 2015) – United Nations human rights experts today urged the Iranian Government to immediately release the Washington Post’s correspondent in Tehran, Jason Rezaian, who now awaits verdict after his fourth and possible final hearing earlier this week. “The arrest, detention and secret trial of Mr. Rezaian violate his rights and intimidate all those working in the media in Iran,” said the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, David Kaye. “His continued detention violates basic rules that not only aim to protect journalists, bloggers, human rights activists and others but to guarantee everyone’s right to information.” Iranian authorities detained Mr. Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, over a year ago, though she was subsequently released. In secret proceedings, he has reportedly been accused of espionage, collaboration with hostile governments, gathering classified information and disseminating propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran. “Mr. Rezaian seems to have been detained for the simple fact of having exercised his rights to freedom of expression, association and political participation,” said human rights expert Seong-Phil Hong, who currently heads the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. “His rights to legal counsel of his choice and to due process of law seem to have been forgotten.” Mr. Rezaian’s trial has been held closed to the public and even his close relatives. He has had no opportunity to present witnesses or evidence in his defense, or to examine and challenge witnesses and evidence against him. Mr. Rezaian has also been deprived of his right to consular visitation. The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, reminded the Iranian Government of its responsibility to ensure that journalists do not face prosecution for exercising their professional activities. “Mr. Rezaian’s case is part of a broader crackdown on freedom of expression in Iran. Journalists must be protected, not harassed, detained or prosecuted,” he stressed. The UN experts noted that Mr. Rezaian, who is being held at Evin Prison in Tehran, was placed in solitary confinement for five months and subjected to full-day interrogation sessions that caused significant physical and psychological strain. The conditions at Evin Prison have resulted in Rezaian’s dramatic weight loss, respiratory problems, and chronic infections. “He has suffered unlawful treatment during his year-long incarceration,” Mr. Hong highlighted. “We urge the Iranian Government to release Mr. Rezaian as well as all those exercising their rights to expression who have been arbitrarily arrested, detained and prosecuted,” the human rights experts said. The Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures’ experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.

"After more than 18 months, Jason Rezaian was released from an Iranian prison through a deal between the U.S. and Iran. “I want people to know that physically I’m feeling good,” Rezaian told Post editors on Monday. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron and Foreign Editor Douglas Jehl met with Rezaian for two hours in a conference room in Landstuhl, Germany. Baron and Jehl said that ""the face-to-face meeting so soon after Rezaian’s return was an encouraging sign."" During the meetings, Rezaian described how at one point he spent 49 days in solitary confinement. He got his exercise by walking around an 8-by-8-foot concrete courtyard, for five hours every day.   Read more: Freeing a reporter: Secret talks and a scary last-minute delay Family members and congressmen reunited with freed Americans For Rezaian and others freed from Iran, journey home could be a long one"	160	"[{""start"": 475, ""end"": 572, ""text"": ""During the meetings, Rezaian described how at one point he spent 49 days in solitary confinement."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	170	2023-03-22T14:34:01.787422Z	2023-03-22T14:34:01.787525Z	57.283
It’s a long trip from Tehran, but it won’t really end when three Americans released from Iranian prisons over the weekend touch down in the United States. It may be months before they can reclaim the freedom to live an ordinary life, before they feel as if they are truly at home again. Journalists, diplomats and others who have been held overseas have suffered sleeplessness, nightmares and illnesses induced by their imprisonment. They have confronted the inevitable choices about whether to seek privacy or accept publicity. For the prisoners released Saturday, those questions will be complicated by a heated presidential campaign. And then there are the little things. Joshua Fattal, an American who was arrested by Iranian officials while hiking near the border between Iraq and Iran and who spent two years in captivity, recalled moving into his first apartment after his release in 2011. He promptly lost his keys. “I wasn’t allowed to touch keys for a long time,” he explained. How individuals respond to captivity varies widely, said Frank Ochberg, a psychiatrist at Michigan State University and a leading figure in research on traumatic stress. “I don’t think we really know why one person is more emotionally and physically resilient than somebody else,” he said. For those leaving prison, a comprehensive medical checkup is crucial, Ochberg said. Poor nutrition, unsanitary conditions and environmental toxins in prison can combine with stress to produce or exacerbate a range of medical conditions, such as diabetes, infections, thyroid disorders, circulatory problems, multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Three of the American prisoners leaving Iran — Jason Rezaian, a correspondent for The Washington Post; Saeed Abedini, an evangelical pastor; and Amir Hekmati, a former Marine — arrived in Germany on Sunday afternoon, where they were receiving medical attention at a U.S. military hospital. A fourth prisoner, student Matt Trevithick, was released and left the country separately. A fifth American, Nosratollah ­Khosravi-Roodsari, was also released but chose to remain in Iran. In general, Ochberg said, seeing a psychologist isn’t always necessary, especially for the former prisoners who have family and close friends to return to and a sense of purpose in their professional lives. That isn’t to say that acclimating to freedom is easy. Roxana Saberi, a journalist imprisoned in Iran in 2009, had a habit of looking over her shoulder when she first returned to the United States. While she was in prison, the Iranians had demanded that she spy for them once she was released. It took her some time to shake the feeling that they would kidnap her and imprison her again because she was not cooperating. “Those captors were very good at putting that fear in my head, that they could find me wherever I was,” Saberi said. “It’s not a fear that’s based in reality. It’s just that some of those fears are, kind of, ingrained in my psyche.” Like Rezaian, Saberi had been living and reporting in Iran when she was arrested, accused of espionage and locked up in Evin Prison. An appellate court ordered her release, and she was freed after spending 100 days in captivity. Back at home, she couldn’t sleep at times. “I had nightmares that people were coming for me, because I was taken from my apartment in Tehran,” she said. “Those nightmares are very rare now,” she added. “It took me probably a good two years to feel like I was really in a good place.” Saberi chose to share her ordeal with the public. “I tried to focus on writing about my experiences and talking about my cellmates I had left behind,” she said. “It gave me a sense of purpose.” For others, the notoriety is disorienting. Fattal often felt as though people in the United States saw him only as a symbol in the political controversy surrounding Iran, not a human being. “People have such strong opinions about the politics, where as a prisoner, that’s your life,” he said. It was strange to find “everyone arguing about you and what you mean,” he added. “You just want to kind of get your feet on the ground and figure things out again.” That discomfort might be even more pronounced for Rezaian, Abedini and Hekmati, who are returning to the United States during a presidential campaign in which candidates on both sides of the debate about Iran probably will invoke their names and their stories in support of their positions. Fattal predicted that Democratic and Republican candidates alike will point to what Rezaian suffered behind bars to show that Iran can’t be trusted. Rezaian, a journalist, will have a chance to write about his incarceration and set the terms of the debate over the episode himself. “He will have to make a decision about how soon he wants to be public, how much he wants to say that could be private and intimate,” said Ochberg, the psychiatrist. “There are definitely people who are going to be curious.” For now, all that is still in the future, and Rezaian and his fellow former prisoners can enjoy their freedom. “Initially, it’s absolutely fantastic,” said David Rohde, an investigative journalist for Reuters. The Taliban kidnapped Rohde in Afghanistan in 2008 while he was reporting for the New York Times. He escaped after seven months in captivity. “You’re not locked in a room. You eat when you want. You hug your loved ones when you want,” Rohde added. “Whatever difficulties you face, it’s so much better than being there.”	159	"[{""start"": 287, ""end"": 527, ""text"": ""Journalists, diplomats and others who have been held overseas have suffered sleeplessness, nightmares and illnesses induced by their imprisonment.

Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and the man who negotiated his release from an Iranian prison, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, lauded the principle of bringing Americans in trouble home, no matter how hard the task, as they shared a stage Thursday at the opening of The Post’s new headquarters. Rezaian, who was released with four other U.S. citizens Jan. 16, and Kerry both choked up with emotion while addressing senior Post executives and invited guests in the main conference room at The Post’s K Street offices in Northwest Washington. Rezaian occasionally stopped to regain his composure as he recalled his 18 months in captivity and trial on espionage and other charges. His family and The Post had called the charges trumped-up accusations leveled against a journalist just doing his job. “For much of the 18 months I was in prison, my Iranian interrogators told me The Washington Post did not exist, that no one knew of my plight, that the U.S. government would not lift a finger for my release,” said Rezaian, who was accompanied by his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, his brother Ali, and the men’s mother, Mary Rezaian. “Today I am in this room with the very people who helped prove the Iranians wrong.” In a long list of thank-yous to his family and Post editors who worked to keep his case in the spotlight, Rezaian thanked Kerry and Brett McGurk, currently a special presidential envoy who negotiated with the Iranians for 14 months for a prisoner deal that got most of the imprisoned Americans out. “No other country would do so much for an ordinary citizen, and I know that,” Rezaian said. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who worked as a senator to get an accounting of prisoners of war and other military personnel lost in Southeast Asia, recalled a desperate search for Rezaian’s mother and wife, who could not be located in Tehran in the final hours before a Swiss plane bearing the group lifted off. U.S. negotiators demanded that the plane not leave without the women, and Kerry enlisted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to help locate a judge in the middle of the night and ensure that the women were at the airport and authorized to depart. “In the military, the most sacred pledge is you can never leave a buddy behind,” said Kerry, pausing momentarily until the emotion in his voice came under control. “Like most pledges, it’s a lot easier to say than to do, no matter how great the effort.” Kerry said the anxiety Rezaian’s family felt for his welfare was shared by the families of the other Americans released as part of the prisoner deal. He vowed to continue working to get information on the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who has been missing in Iran since 2007. Kerry noted that across the world, 71 members of the news media were killed on the job last year and almost 200 imprisoned. He said journalists once were usually accidental casualties but now are more likely to be deliberately targeted for the stories they have brought to light. “A country without a free and independent press has nothing to brag about, nothing to teach, no way to fulfill its potential,” Kerry said. When Kerry arrived, he sat in the front row between Rezaian and The Post’s owner, Jeffrey P. Bezos. Kerry said journalism is not a dying enterprise, calling curiosity and the desire to know the truth “part of the human DNA.” “The new building is a neon sign that shows faith in the future of newspapers, and that The Washington Post’s storied past in speaking truth to power is one of the reasons that people in the media are prepared to stand up to the powerful,” Kerry said.	158	"[{""start"": 550, ""end"": 1130, ""text"": ""Rezaian occasionally stopped to regain his composure as he recalled his 18 months in captivity and trial on espionage and other charges.

The prison cell that has been Jason Rezaian’s home for most of the past 141 days has no mattress. He has slept on blankets on the hard floor and awakened each morning with back pain, for which he has received no treatment. He suffers from chronic eye infections that have persisted for so long his family fears permanent damage to his vision. For more than a month, he has been afflicted by a groin inflammation so painful he sometimes has trouble standing. Almost five months after Rezaian’s still-unexplained arrest, family members say conditions in Iran’s Evin prison are taking a fearsome toll on the 38-year-old Tehran correspondent for The Washington Post. But even worse than the physical discomforts, they say, are the psychological effects from near-total isolation and uncertainty over how long the ordeal will last. The uncertainty deepened further Sunday withIran’s announcement that formal charges — still unspecified — have been filed. “Every day, we’re in new territory,” Rezaian’s brother, Ali, a California businessman, said in an interview. “Never has a Western journalist been held this long. It’s taking a devastating toll on him, physically and mentally.” Worry over Rezaian’s health has prompted family members to speak in unprecedented detail about his well-being as he nears the end of his fifth month in detention. In interviews, relatives spoke of his growing despair in recent weeks as Iranian officials repeatedly dangled the possibility of freedom and then took it away again. Iranian officials have kept Rezaian in solitary confinement for most of his time in detention, never allowing him to meet his attorney and permitting only a handful of visits with his wife and one other relative, family members say. He was not allowed to contact his U.S.-based family until two weeks ago, when he was permitted to call his mother on Thanksgiving Day. “At first, I thought he sounded great, but as we talked, I could tell he wasn’t,” Mary Breme Rezaian said of the conversation. “We tried to talk about past things and previous Thanksgivings, but we both kept breaking down in tears.” Rezaian, a San Francisco native and son of an Iranian immigrant, was arrested at his Tehran home July 22 with his wife, Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi. She was released on bail in October, but Iranian officials extended Rezaian’s detention for an additional two months, citing an ongoing investigation. In Iran, the filing of formal charges sometimes can lead to a release after a bail hearing, but it also throws new uncertainty into the case, including the possibility of more delays, according to human rights experts familiar with the country’s legal system. “In national security cases, the judge can renew temporary pretrial detention indefinitely,” said Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch. “And [the judge] can prevent lawyers speaking to clients or accessing files.” No public explanation has been provided for the arrests, and Iranian officials did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment for this article. Some experts have speculated that Rezaian has been caught up in a domestic power struggle between Iranian political factions feuding over Tehran’s recent diplomatic opening toward the West. Iran’s influential Human Rights Council secretary, Mohammed Javad Larijani, last week called the case a “fiasco” and expressed hope that the matter would be quickly resolved. The Obama administration, which is engaged in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, has stepped up pressure on Iran’s government in the past week. On Sunday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry urged Iran to drop the charges against Rezaian, saying the journalist “poses no threat to the Iranian government or to Iran’s national security.” A State Department spokesman said Tuesday that the United States remained “committed to returning Jason Rezaian to his family, friends and loved ones.” But with no end to the ordeal in sight, the Rezaian family’s frustration is growing. Relatives have begun to speak more candidly, drawing on details provided by visitors to paint a portrait of Rezaian’s life since his arrest. Their account, which matches descriptions by former inmates of Evin prison, depicts an endless cycle of physical deprivation, extreme isolation and frequent interrogations apparently aimed at coercing Rezaian to confess to wrongdoing. “It is constant pressure for him: psychological pressure, interrogation tactics,” Ali Rezaian said. “They’re trying to manipulate his psychological state, to get misinformation to make him more compliant with what they want him to do.” Since the day of his arrest, relatives say, Rezaian has been mostly kept in solitary confinement in Evin, a fortress-like prison on Tehran’s outskirts originally built by Iran’s last monarch, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Former prisoners who spent time in Evin’s solitary-confinement unit described cramped cells that are miserably hot in the summer and cold in winter. One former inmate, Iranian-born scholar and author Haleh Esfandiari, recalled a lack of amenities other than a sink, a pair of blankets and a Koran. Esfandiari spent 105 days in Evin and, like Rezaian, had no mattress. “The door is locked, and you’re on your own,” said Esfandiari, who now directs the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington think tank. “To go to the bathroom, you have to knock on the door. The whole idea [is] to move you to despair, to make you feel isolated,” she said. “They keep repeating that no one in the outside world cares about you.” For Rezaian, the ordeal has been complicated by health problems. The journalist was being treated for high blood pressure at the time of his arrest, and family members worried that a combination of stress and a lack of access to medicine could aggravate his condition. Rezaian eventually was given an Iranian version of his blood-pressure medication, but inthe meantime, other problems emerged. His chronic eye infections went untreated for weeks, and the symptoms have continued since the prison recently began administering eye drops, family members said. More troubling is a testicular inflammation that surfaced about a month ago and causes bouts of excruciating pain, family members said. In recent days, Rezaian was given a sonogram to determine the cause of the inflammation, but the results of the tests are not yet known. “They’ve been undertreated,” Ali Rezaian said of his brother’s medical problems. “He has been able to see a doctor twice, but in both cases it took over a month of efforts and him complaining about conditions.” He described his brother as “very depressed, almost to the point of losing hope.” Rezaian’s surprise telephone call at Thanksgiving brought a measure of relief, ending a four-month drought in direct contact between the prisoner and his U.S. relatives. Mary Rezaian said she spoke with her son for half an hour, but she was acutely aware that others were present in the room with her son and listening to the conversation. “There were topics I could not begin to address,” she said. “Both of us were bemused to be speaking to one another. There was not advanced warning, so we couldn’t really prepare.” Although other journalists have been arrested in Iran, Rezaian did not expect that he would be targeted, his mother said. Rezaian had taken great care not to touch any of the tripwires that had gotten other journalists in trouble with Iran’s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the agency that grants credentials to foreign journalists. “He knew about the high-profile cases where people had broken the rules,” she said. “He followed the rules.” She said her son did not complain about his plight during his Thanksgiving phone call other than to express regret about upsetting the family’s holiday plans. Before his arrest, Rezaian had expected a visit home for the holidays with his wife, the first since their recent marriage. “I was really hoping to bring Yegi this year,” he told his mother, using his wife’s nickname. Mary Rezaian tried to be reassuring during the call, thinking at the time that her son probably would be released soon, she said. After all, he had not been charged with a crime, and the clock was running down on the 60-day extension that had kept him locked up since October. “The expectation was that we’d be seeing each other,” she said. The announcement of formal charges against Rezaian came nine days later.	157	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 1339, ""text"": ""son cell that has been Jason Rezaian’s home for most of the past 141 days has no mattress.

Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian went on trial Tuesday on espionage and other charges in a closed Tehran courtroom more than 10 months after he was imprisoned, but the proceedings were adjourned without any indication of when they would resume. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Abolghassem Salavati, a judge known for draconian sentences, read the four-count indictment in a two-hour session in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court. The semiofficial Mehr News Agency said Rezaian roundly denied having done anything outside the normal activities of a news reporter. “I am a journalist, and all of my activities have been conducted as a journalist, and all were legal,” Mehr quoted him as saying when the judge asked about his contacts with U.S. Consulate officials in Dubai, where Rezaian’s family says he was seeking a visa for his Iranian-born wife. It could not be determined from the Mehr account whether the news agency, which is affiliated with the government, had a reporter in the courtroom. Rezaian’s attorney, Leila Ahsan, told the family that the trial would continue “at a later session,” according to Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian. It was not clear whether another court date has been set or whether Ahsan was not permitted to say more. Under Iranian law, it is illegal to reveal details about a closed-door hearing. The defendant’s mother, Mary Rezaian, and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, a reporter for the National newspaper in Abu Dhabi, were nearby during the proceedings. Rezaian may not have even been aware of their proximity. His mother traveled to Tehran two weeks ago hoping to attend his trial, but her request was denied. The women went to the courthouse Tuesday. However, they were not allowed access to the floor where the proceedings were held, Ali Rezaian said. After they waited for about five hours, he said, a clerk informed them that the proceedings had ended. They did not get to see Jason Rezaian, even from afar. He apparently entered and exited the courthouse through a back door, his brother said, based on Iranian news accounts and the few details Ahsan could share. “We have absolutely no idea what happened in court, other than the fact the indictment against Jason was read,” Ali Rezaian said. The closed-door nature of the trial has been condemned by journalism organizations, The Washington Post and the State Department. “It certainly adds to concerns, and it fits, unfortunately, into a pattern of a complete lack of transparency and lack of due process that we’ve seen since Jason was detained,” said Jeff Rathke, deputy spokesman for the State Department. “While we call for it to be open, we also maintain he never should have been held and tried in the first place.” Rathke said the State Department is “monitoring” the progress of Rezaian’s trial, a task he acknowledged is difficult because no outsiders are allowed in the courtroom.He called for “all of the absurd charges to be dropped and for Jason Rezaian to be released immediately.” Rezaian, 39, is The Post’s Tehran bureau chief. He was arrested July 22, along with his wife and two photojournalists. All but Rezaian have been released on bail. Rezaian was born and raised in California, but he holds Iranian as well as U.S. citizenship. The government in Tehran does not recognize dual nationality and contends that Washington has no legal standing to press for his release. Rezaian has been accused of espionage and propaganda against Iran. He faces four charges that carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The Post has vigorously protested his detention. During months of nuclear negotiations with Iran, the State Department has repeatedly raised the cases of Rezaian and two Americans already convicted in Iran: former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati and pastor Saeed Abedini, as well as a missing former FBI agent, Robert Levinson. The four Americans have been mentioned on the sidelines of the talks, however, and it does not appear that their release would be a condition for a nuclear deal with Iran.

Update: Archived video of the press conference is available below. This post has also been updated to include text of the remarks given at the event. The National Press Club is hosting a press conference today at 2pm ET to discuss the latest developments in the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent who has been imprisoned in Iran since July 2014. Statements are expected from John Hughes, NPC president, Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, and Douglas Jehl, Washington Post foreign editor. Boxing legend Muhammad Ali also issued a statement urging Iran to free Jason Rezaian. Remarks given by John Hughes, president of the National Press Club (edited for brevity): Good afternoon. I’m John Hughes, president of the National Press Club, and an editor for Bloomberg’s First Word, the breaking news desk in Washington. We are here to talk about the case of Washington Post Reporter Jason Rezaian. Jason has been held in an Iranian prison since July 22. This is the longest captivity for a Western journalist in Iran. I am joined up here by Ali Rezaian, Jason’s brother, and Doug Jehl, Jason’s editor at the Washington Post. We at the National Press Club, on behalf of our 3,100 members worldwide, speak out year round on press freedom through our programs and statements. Today, we are taking the additional step of holding a news conference. Why? First, unfortunately, more journalists around the world are being prevented from doing their jobs. We at the Club are raising our voices to fight this trend. Second, with Jason, this is personal. Washington is our home. Jason’s newspaper lands on our front porches. It is read at our breakfast tables. Jason is part of our Washington journalism community — he’s like family. So today, we are making a special announcement. It is my great honor to announce that the Club’s Press Freedom Committee, and Board of Governors, voted to give Jason one of our greatest recognitions — the John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award. This distinction is for journalists who face adversity in the performance of their craft and who show a commitment to press freedom. We will recognize all Club award winners at a prestigious dinner in our ballroom on July 29. We expect Jason will be free to collect this award. In the past, we have seen nations large and small decide that they do not want us to go to the microphone and say “this winner cannot be with us tonight because he or she continues to be held in a prison.” It is in Iran’s power to prevent this from happening. Iran can set Jason free. We hope and believe leaders will do the right thing. It is time — it is past time — for Jason to be released. We at the National Press Club will raise our voices, again and again, until that happens. People from change.org are here today. Can you stand up please? Later, they will be available to help those of you in the room sign the petition for Jason. But now can you all bring up those boxes please. Thanks – now these are boxes of signatures like this and there are about 230,000 of them that have been collected so far. That number is going to go up after the interest we generate today. Please add your voice to this cause. Earlier today, the National Press Club was proud to release a statement from the Greatest — Muhammad Ali, about Jason’s case. We can’t tell you how excited and honored we were to do this. That Muhmmad Ali was willing to speak out on Jason’s case tells you what kind of Champ he truly is. We want to state publicly how grateful we are that he did this. Before we take questions I want recognize some special guests. Jason’s former classmates from the Marin Academy are here, led by Rachel Goeiz. Can you all please stand. These folks have known Jason for many years. A journalism teacher who worked with Jason is here, Timathea Workman. Can you raise your hand? These people are here today to support Jason. He is that kind of person, and many people feel a strong connection to him and are working to set him free. Remarks given by Douglas Jehl, foreign editor of The Washington Post: Last year was among the most dangerous years ever recorded for journalists working abroad. Reporters and photographers working in zones of war and deadly disease make incalculable sacrifices for readers around the world, including readers of The Washington Post. At The Post, we feel particular outrage at the severe treatment endured by Jason Rezaian, our cherished Tehran correspondent, who has now been detained in Iran for 233 days. At every turn, Iran’s handling of the case has reinforced an impression of state-sponsored injustice. Jason is a fully-accredited journalist who has done nothing wrong. He has been held since July 22 without access to a lawyer, without visits by consular authorities, without a public accounting of the charges against him. He has been subjected to extensive interrogation, which has taken a significant toll. We know that fairness and justice could only result in Jason’s immediate release. The approaching Iranian New Year, Noruz, should be a season of mercy, and we call on Iran to act on this spirit. Until Jason is free, his treatment by Iran can only be seen as an abomination worthy of the world’s condemnation. Remarks given by Ali Rezaian, brother of Jason Rezaian: Thank you all for joining us today. First I would like to thank the National Press Club for making this event possible. I would also like to thank Reporters Without Borders and Change.org for their tireless efforts on Jason’s behalf. Finally, I’d like to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts, both public and private, of The Washington Post and our family’s advisors who have been working towards Jason and Yegi’s release for these past 232 days. Before we take questions I want to update you on Jason and Yegi’s situation and give you a sense of our ongoing efforts to raise international awareness of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s unprecedented detention of a credentialed journalist. I’ll also discuss expected future milestones in the case. As of today, my brother Jason has been held in Iran’s Evin prison for nearly eight months. This is twice as long as any other western journalist. Throughout his ordeal, Jason has been subjected to intense interrogation, isolation and has been denied timely medical treatment. The Iranian government has never provided evidence of any wrongdoing on his part and they have systematically ignored their own legal process to extend his detention, deprive Jason of his right to legal counsel and deny virtually all his protections under the Iranian constitution. As you can imagine, Jason’s imprisonment has been tremendously difficult on him. For nearly five months, Jason was held in solitary confinement, frequently interrogated for 7-10 hours per day and then subjected to week-long periods of isolation. Within the first two months of his detention Jason lost nearly 50 pounds. He suffered though months of debilitating back pain and serious infections, exacerbated by delays in treatment. I am happy to report that, in the recent months, Jason has been treated by appropriate physicians and has been moved from solitary into a shared cell. But while we are told that his physical condition has improved, we know that these past 8 months have taken a great toll on his psychological condition. Any person subjected to these conditions would be psychologically scarred, but in Jason’s case there is the added burden of knowing that, without even the pretense of evidence, the country which he worked so hard to demystify to the world continues to deprive him of his rights and ignores their legal process to prevent him from presenting a defense. While Jason’s wife Yeganeh was released on bail after nearly two months in Evin, she continues to suffer. For months, she was forbidden to consult an attorney. Her press credentials were revoked, and she lives in constant fear of punishment for any misstep in her daily life. All this while she works desperately within Iran to free Jason and is unable to interact with many of her friends. In early January, their case was referred to the Revolutionary Court and assigned to a judge known for imposing harsh sentences and limiting defendants’ ability to prepare and present a defense. Since the case entered the judiciary, Yeganeh and Jason have, after nearly six months, been able to hire an attorney, though pressure and illegal tactics were employed to prevent Jason from retaining separate council. I am happy to report that Jason and Yeganeh’s attorney has begun the review of their case file. Separately, the judge recently approved her request for more frequent visitation and Jason and Yegi be allowed to resume face to face meetings. We have been fortunate enough to have a tremendous support system which I mentioned earlier and I want to highlight some of our current efforts. First I would like to call your attention to the letter released today and joined by many notable journalists and international organizations calling on the leader of Iran’s judiciary to revisit this case. We are confident that any fair reading of the evidence will result in Jason and Yegi’s immediate release. Today, we are also making available two videos for your use. The first video is produced by The Washington Post and focuses on the facts of Jason and Yegi’s ordeal. The second video, produced by Jason’s friend of 35 years Robbie Stauder, focuses on our mother’s trip to Iran in December to visit Jason. We are thrilled by the overwhelming response to our petition on change.org/freejason. As an individual you can join the nearly two hundred and fifty thousand people who have signed the petition at change.org/freejason. It is notable that this petition has remained one of the fastest growing petitions on change.org for the past month with people from over 80 countries calling for Jason’s immediate release. As always, information about the case, links to relevant articles and updates can all be found at: www.freejasonandyegi.com, #freejason or @freejasonyegi on Twitter and at www.facebook.com/freejasonyegi. Thinking about what’s ahead– When my mother returned from Iran in January she told me Jason said “Tell Ali to get me out before my birthday.” At the time, that seemed like a reasonable time line, albeit one that I do not control. Jason’s birthday is this coming Sunday the 15th. Iranians around the world celebrate New Years, Nowruz, at the Spring Solstice. This year it falls on March 20th. This is a very significant time of year for Iranians. A time of new beginnings when families gather and a time of generosity and mercy. Jason and Yegi’s lawyer has requested a temporary bail for Jason for the first five days of the new year. In the spirit of Nowruz, I would ask all those in power in Iran consider if they truly believe that Jason should begin the new year in Evin, and that Judge Salavati please allow Jason to spend the Nowruz with his wife and her family.	155	"[{""start"": 270, ""end"": 375, ""text"": ""Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent who has been imprisoned in Iran since July 2014"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 514, ""end"": 599, ""text"": ""Boxing legend Muhammad Ali also issued a statement urging Iran to free Jason Rezaian."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 840, ""end"": 1037, ""text"": ""We are here to talk about the case of Washington Post Reporter Jason Rezaian.
