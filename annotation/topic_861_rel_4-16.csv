Maybe it was the string of customer-service disasters, starting with the Costa Concordia tragedy last year and leading up to the recent Carnival Triumph “poop” cruise, on which passengers were left adrift in the Gulf of Mexico for five days without working toilets. Maybe it was the threat of government regulation from Sen. Charles Schumer (D.-N.Y.), a vocal critic of the cruise industry, that made it move. Then again, maybe we should just take the cruise industry at its word on its decision, announced just before the Memorial Day holiday, to introduce a passenger “bill of rights.” But here’s what we have: a promise by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) to add a list of “rights” to its ticket contracts, the legal agreement between passengers and the cruise line. These include the right to leave a docked ship if it can’t provide essentials such as food, water, bathroom facilities and medical care; the right to a full refund for a trip canceled because of mechanical failures, or a partial refund if a trip is cut short for the same reason; and the right to timely updates about any changes in a ship’s itinerary caused by a mechanical failure or an emergency. None of these rights are new. Instead, they codify “many longstanding practices of CLIA,” according to Christine Duffy, the organization’s chief executive. “The cruise industry is committed to continuing to deliver against the high standards we set for ourselves in all areas of shipboard operations,” she adds. But would the bill have affected the outcome of any recent customer-service meltdowns, including the Triumph fiasco, or even the latest disaster, a fire that cut short a sailing on Royal Caribbean’s Grandeur of the Seas last month? Stewart Chiron, a Miami travel agent who’s known for his pro-industry views, says that the answer is “no.” Rather, he thinks that the reason for the bill is political. Late last year, CLIA merged with several trade groups, including the European Cruise Council, the Asia Cruise Association and the Passenger Shipping Association, and is just taking the new organization on a “test drive” with this bill. “It made sense to quickly agree on a consistent cruise passenger bill of rights,” he says. Perhaps too quickly. Although CLIA representatives claim that they collaborated closely with Schumer on the bill, the senator appeared to be caught off guard by the sudden announcement, made at a time when no one was likely to pay attention to it. In a letter to CLIA, Schumer pressed the association for specifics on its new pledge. Who determines that essential provisions such as food and water can’t be provided? What exactly are the cruise lines’ current reimbursement practices? How will passengers be notified of changes to their itinerary? Schumer has called the bill “a step in the right direction” but has stopped short of endorsing it. “I still have many remaining questions, both on the content and how the bill of rights will be enforced,” he told the Associated Press. A CLIA representative said that the organization will answer him “soon.” Passengers are skeptical, too. Some say that they’d prefer deeds to words when it comes to passenger protections. “If the cruise lines had any brains, they’d forgo some of their billions of profits yearly for their good name and get their guys trained in damage control,” says Richard Johnson, a retired naval officer who lives in Cedar Hill, Tex. “And firefighting.” To others, the existing passenger contract is something of a joke, and adding passenger rights language is little more than a punch line. Bruce Helenbart, an engineer from Hazelwood, Mo., says that he recently had to wade through a 20-page cruise ticket contract and sign it before setting sail. It included disclaimers stating that the cruise line wasn’t responsible for the ship’s doctor, provisions limiting Helenbart’s ability to sue the cruise line, and a clause that allowed the company to alter the itinerary any way it chose to. What’s more, the agreement was what’s known as an “adhesion” contract — a one-way agreement that bound him. If he didn’t sign it, he couldn’t board. “It’s all there except about the volunteering to be turned into a manipede,” he says. James Walker, a maritime attorney based in Miami, says that customers are correct to disbelieve the cruise industry’s new customer-service rhetoric. “It’s actually a step in the wrong direction,” he told me. “What this bill of rights does, in fact, is limit the liability of cruise lines.” For example, if this bill had been in effect during the Triumph disaster, then Carnival would have been obligated only to refund part of the passengers’ payment — not to repay the cost of the entire cruise, cover passengers’ transportation expenses, zero out their onboard bills, issue a voucher for a future cruise and pay them $500 each, as Carnival did, he says. “I would view this as a PR move that effectively limits the rights of passengers,” he adds. “They are proposing rights that are beneficial to the cruise lines, but not to their customers.” The cruise industry needs the positive publicity that would probably come from an uncritical industry press. But more importantly, says Walker, it hopes to keep likely legislation by Schumer, which would have the force of law, from ever reaching the Senate floor. Bill or no bill, the fact remains that you’re still giving up a lot of rights when you sign up for a cruise. Maybe too many. The only way to avoid that — at least for the foreseeable future — is to stay on dry land. E-mail Christopher Elliott at chris@elliott.org.

Last month, just days after the cruise ship Costa Concordia ran aground off a Tuscan island, killing 17 people and leaving 15 missing, Discovery Channel announced that it would “dissect the anatomy” of the Friday the 13th disaster and — with the quiet confidence of a network long used to being the only game in town — said the docu would air “this spring.” But on the same day an Italian court refused to lift the house arrest order for the ship’s captain — who is under investigation on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the vessel before all passengers were evacuated — National Geographic Channel pounced. NatGeo announced Tuesday that it had hired the producers of the quick-turnaround British documentary “Terror at Sea: The Sinking of the Concordia” — which already aired on the United Kingdom’s Channel 4 — to rework it for the United States under the name “Italian Cruise Ship Disaster: The Untold Stories.” It will air Sunday, NatGeo announced. And that beats to air by one week Discovery’s premiere of “Cruise Ship Disaster: Inside the Concordia.” “Just announced! National Geographic Channel to air first U.S. documentary detailing the Italian cruise ship disaster moment-by-moment,” NatGeo bragged Tuesday. Discovery’s Costa Concordia project will be a very focused forensic investigation that uses experts from the Massachusetts Maritime Academy and that includes survivor stories and eyewitness accounts. Discovery crews will be covering the teams charged with figuring out how to salvage a shipping vessel larger than the Titanic. The Discovery docu will address such questions as: What happened at the time of the accident? What role did captain Francesco Schettin play? How did the crew evacuate the ship? What are the mechanics of searching the site while guarding the waters against environmental damage? What lies next for the massive, unprecedented salvage mission? And will salvage teams be able to save the ship and successfully dismantle its once mighty hull and frame? “With so many unanswered questions, Discovery will piece together not only the immediate events, but the bigger story of what comes next in recovery and restoration,” Nancy Daniels, executive VP of production and development for Discovery Channel, said recently. NatGeo’s Concordia program promises to detail the sinking in a “still raw” account, told primarily through the eyes of those who experienced it, who are also American. “American survivors tell their haunting story in depth and share exclusive home video footage,” NatGeo promised. For the NatGeo telecast, the British documentary’s non-American interviews have been swapped out for American ones: Sameer and Divya Sharma from Massachusetts were celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary, and 18-year-old Amanda Warrick, who was traveling with her older brothers, tossed out the idea on the Friday-the-13th departure date that “something’s gonna happen.” When the ship hit the rocks, “at first there was a tilt and a shake of the ship — that’s when tables and glasses started crashing. I was kind of in shock. I remember immediately standing up and looking at my brothers. I was just kind of speechless and silent,” Amanda says in the docu. “It’s really an experiential look at this — what it would be like if you were on” the ship, Michael Cascio, NatGeo exec VP of programming, told The TV Column. “We thought our contribution would be best handled by airing accounts of people who were on it,” including “lots of user-generated video.” “We’ve used this kind of witness approach before,” Cascio said, noting the channel’s premiere April 13 of the documentary “Witness: Disaster in Japan,” about that country’s earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant emergency. That docu aired one month after that disaster. “When we did the Japanese disaster, and some of these other disasters — it’s a niche to be filled — the news networks have done their bits and pieces, but nobody has put it together,” he said. In tune with ‘The Voice’ In its second night as The Best Thing to Happen to NBC in Ages, the singing competition series “The Voice” clocked nearly 18 million viewers. That’s NBC’s biggest audience in the Monday 8-to-10 p.m. time slot in five years. That total also puts “The Voice” not far behind Fox’s “American Idol,” which last Wednesday (its stronger night) logged 18.5 million viewers. Yes, the night before, “The Voice” had enjoyed a post-Super Bowl broadcast and snagged 37 million viewers.   Following “The Voice” on Monday, NBC’s new highly hyped musical drama, “Smash,” hung on to about 12 million viewers — and the biggest ratings among the prized 18- to-49-year-olds of any regular 10 p.m. drama on any network this season.  “Idol” exec producer Nigel Lythgoe, who got on the phone with reporters Tuesday to discuss his show, said “The Voice,” as well as Simon Cowell’s “The X Factor,” had created singing-show fatigue among viewers, but he seemed peevish at suggestions that “Idol” was limping along. “My God, the rest of the world would love these ratings, for God’s sake!” Lythgoe said. “Let’s hope all of the other shows, like ‘X Factor’ and ‘The Voice,’ continue to be successful for 11 years. I’ll celebrate. . . . I’ll keep my fingers crossed for them,” Lythgoe added. No, we don’t think anyone believed him. Asked for his thoughts on “The Voice” this season, Lythgoe pronounced the show “gimmicky” and in need of “stronger talent,” although he said he liked the relationship between judges Blake Shelton and Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, reports The Post’s Emily Yahr.	326	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 355, ""text"": ""Last month, just days after the cruise ship Costa Concordia ran aground off a Tuscan island, killing 17 people and leaving 15 missing, Discovery Channel announced that it would “dissect the anatomy” of the Friday the 13th disaster and — with the quiet confidence of a network long used to being the only game in town — said the docu would air “this spring"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 358, ""end"": 636, ""text"": ""t on the same day an Italian court refused to lift the house arrest order for the ship’s captain — who is under investigation on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the vessel before all passengers were evacuated — National Geographic Channel pounce"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2942, ""end"": 3095, ""text"": ""When the ship hit the rocks, “at first there was a tilt and a shake of the ship — that’s when tables and glasses started crashing.

Pat Busovicki’s Eastern Caribbean cruise on the Carnival Dream almost ended in a nightmare. One afternoon, after plummeting down its Twister water slide, she says, she found herself trapped in a dangerous undertow. “I couldn’t get out,” remembers the retired librarian from Westlake, Ohio. She says that crew members didn’t assist her, and only after her sister cried for help did another passenger jump into the water and rescue her. Busovicki, like a small but growing group of consumer advocates and passengers, believes that cruise lines aren’t doing enough to protect their customers. Despite an industry effort to regulate itself, consumer groups are asking the government for tougher rules that would ensure them safer passage. When Busovicki visited the ship’s doctor, he told her that she’d nearly drowned in the pool. The experience put a damper on the rest of her vacation, and she says that she was disappointed when Carnival didn’t try to make up for the incident. In an e-mail, Carnival said that it’s “extremely sorry” for what happened to her but insisted that it followed safety procedures similar to those for land-based water slides. “The safety and well-being of our guests are at the forefront of our mind on all cruises, with making sure that you have a fun and memorable vacation coming a close second,” the company said. Carnival offered her a $100 credit as a “gesture of goodwill.” A Carnival representative reviewed Busovicki’s claim after she contacted me and said that the firm had handled her case by the book. Not only are its shipboard slides designed with safety in mind, the representative said, but an undertow is unlikely, since the landing trough is a flattened-out, shallow extension of the slide, with at least four team members staffing the area at all times. “She was treated with care and compassion both from our medical team and our guest services staff, and a full examination of what she reported was conducted,” said Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz. “The guest services team followed up with her several times and had an in-person meeting with her so that she could share her concerns, according to the ship’s notes.” The cruise industry claims that trips are safe, despite congressional hearings and passenger accounts that have suggested otherwise. In an attempt to preempt government regulation, the industry adopted a “passenger bill of rights” that addressed some of the most common cruise complaints. The document gave customers the right to get off a docked ship if food, water and medical care can’t adequately be provided on board; the right to a full refund for a trip that’s canceled because of mechanical failures; and the right to have full-time, professional emergency medical attention available aboard ocean cruises. But is the self-imposed bill of rights, which is now more than a year old, enough to ensure cruise passengers’ safety? Some industry watchers are doubtful. “The bill of rights didn’t give passengers any real additional rights,” says Kendall Carver, chairman of the International Cruise Victims Association. “Instead, it was a PR move.” What are cruise lines trying to avoid? A proposed law called the Cruise Passenger Protection Act. Among other things, the bill would compel cruise lines to offer customers a clear, upfront summary of the restrictive terms and conditions in cruise contracts. It would also give the federal government more authority to protect cruise ship passengers, including investigating complaints such as Busovicki’s. In addition, the proposed law would make all alleged crimes on cruise ships publicly available information. The FBI currently reports only crimes that are no longer under investigation, leaving passengers with the impression that cruises are practically crime-free. Although the industry’s effort to self-regulate slowed momentum in Congress, it didn’t stall the proposed law entirely. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), who’s chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, is trying to incorporate parts of the bill’s language into an upcoming Coast Guard reauthorization bill. That follows a Senate hearing this summer in which passengers testified about the lack of consumer protections. The Cruise Passenger Protection Act is necessary to “level the playing field” for passengers, according to Edward Bassett Jr., a Boston attorney who specializes in transportation policy. He notes that some of the laws that apply to cruise ships are more than a century old and were passed to encourage shipbuilding rather than consumer protection. “In the past, the courts have liberally construed these statutes in the ship owner’s favor,” he says. “New legislation is needed to give passengers from this country meaningful legal rights which can be enforced here in the United States.” The cruise industry disagrees. “The Cruise Passenger Protection Act is a solution in search of a problem that punitively singles out the cruise industry, needlessly creates a new federal bureaucracy at taxpayer expense, and will likely increase the cost to consumers in taking a cruise,” says Michael McGarry, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association. Although it can sometimes be a challenge to separate rhetoric from reality on this issue, there are practical takeaways for anyone planning a cruise this fall. Consider an insurance policy with a medical evacuation benefit, so that if you fall ill, you can return to the States quickly. Medical care aboard ships, despite claims to the contrary, is not always up to American standards. Take a camera and use it to collect evidence if there’s an incident on board. Cruise lines may videotape common areas, but if there’s an incident, they won’t give you the footage, says Jack Hickey, a maritime lawyer based in Miami. “Get the full names, addresses, e-mail addresses and cell numbers of all witnesses.” For now, government regulators may be powerless to mediate matters such as customer satisfaction, billing issues or itinerary changes, but that isn’t stopping them from trying. The Federal Maritime Commission’s little-known Cruise Passenger Assistance program can contact a cruise line on the passenger’s behalf and facilitate “a discussion” of the problem at 866-448-9546 or by e-mail at complaints@fmc.gov. And, of course, a competent travel agent can help if you have a customer-service problem. Until the proposed laws are enacted — if indeed they ever are — it’s best to take the same precautions you would on a land-based resort vacation. E-mail Christopher Elliott at chris@elliott.org .

Costa Concordia sinking leaves cruise ship passengers alarmed — and out of luck Christopher Elliott The tragic sinking of the Costa Concordia cruise ship last week is leaving a line of worried passengers in its wake. Betty Westbrook is among them. The retiree from Allen, Tex., called me hours after the ship sank off the Italian coast, hoping that I could help her. “What are my chances for a refund?” she asked. Westbrook believes that had she been aboard the cruise liner, she might have been a casualty. “I’m 82, and I couldn’t have made it off the ship without help,” she says. Reading about the Concordia crew’s alleged unpreparedness for disaster has made her nervous about her February cruise to the Bahamas on the Carnival Magic. The Concordia went down Jan. 13 after running aground near the island of Giglio. At least 11 passengers died. The ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, is reported to have maneuvered the ship too close to a fishing village. He has been arrested and is under investigation for abandoning ship, causing a shipwreck and manslaughter. Costa Cruises is owned by Miami-based Carnival, the world’s largest cruise line operator, and not surprisingly, some passengers are now having second thoughts about their floating vacation. A nonscientific online survey conducted soon after the disaster by the opinion Web site SodaHead.com found that one-quarter of those polled were “less likely” to book a cruise after the Costa disaster. Westbrook told me that when she heard about the Concordia sinking, she phoned her travel agency immediately to find out whether she could cancel her cruise. The answer to her question is: no refunds — at least not for her. “We’re not making any changes to our refund policy,” said Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen. If she canceled, Westbrook would lose her deposit or 75 percent of the total cruise fare, whichever is greater. Costa, however, is offering passengers scheduled to sail on the Concordia through Feb. 25 their money back and a 30 percent cruise credit. Meanwhile, the cruise line says it is covering the costs of lodging and return transportation for the Concordia’s survivors, as well as offering counseling to the passengers and their families “as needed.” It is also refunding all voyage costs, including onboard expenses. In a statement issued just after the incident, Costa and its corporate parent sought to assure passengers such as Westbrook that its vessels are safe. “Costa is committed to ensuring that no such incident ever occurs again,” it said. “Our number-one priority is always the safety and security of our guests and crew, and we comply with all safety regulations.” But passengers have some cause for concern, particularly when it comes to Costa, says Miami-based maritime lawyer Jim Walker. “In the last two years, Costa has had three significant incidents where crew members have been killed and passengers have been injured,” he says. On Feb. 26, 2010, the Costa Europa rammed into a pier in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, as it was trying to dock in rough weather. Three crew members were killed and three passengers were injured. And on Oct. 18, 2010, the Costa Classica collided with a Belgian cargo ship near China’s Yangtze River, injuring several passengers. Costa’s safety record isn’t the only thing that should frighten passengers, say Walker and other legal experts. Also worrisome are the flimsy legal rights passengers have when they book a cruise, outlined in a legal document known as the ticket contract, which is available on the cruise line’s Web site and is normally included with your ticket. For passengers with future cruise plans, the contract delivers some bad news: If you want a refund, and you’re within two weeks of departing on a European cruise, you’re out of luck. (If it’s anywhere between 44 and 15 days until your vacation, you can get half your money back.) The contract is equally restrictive as it applies to the Concordia’s survivors. The fine print limits the cruise line’s liability to about $71,000 per passenger, requires that any claim against the company be filed within a year, restricts the filing venue to a court in Genoa, Italy, and applies Italian law to resolving the dispute. For cruises from U.S. ports, Costa’s contract limits the venue for filing suit to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, effectively turning any lawsuit into a costly federal case. Other ticket language prevents smaller complaints from being brought together as class actions, further limiting passengers’ access to justice, say legal experts. Cruise line claims adjusters often send a series of letters to injured survivors, asking for more information. The time required for correspondence and documentation runs down the clock on any claims, according to David Deehl, an adjunct law professor at the University of Miami and the vice chairman of the American Bar Association’s Admiralty and Maritime Law Committee. “They’re appearing to want to settle, asking for more and more information,” he says. In fact, they’re usually intent on paying the least they can under the law. One place where cruise lines move quickly is in shoring up their own defense, Deehl notes. “They have their own civil defense lawyers who are often flown right to the ship to interview crew and passengers immediately, locking in their defense theories with sworn testimony,” he told me. If you’re considering a cruise vacation, experts suggest reviewing the ticket contract before booking to know what rights you have. If you’re uncomfortable with the terms, they recommend sticking to a land-based vacation. Travel insurance might help the Concordia’s survivors recover some of their lost property and pay for the expense of their interrupted vacation. But only the most expensive policy, known as “cancel for any reason” insurance, would have allowed a passenger like Westbrook to get a refund. (And read the policy carefully — some “cancel for any reason” policies offer only a percentage of your money back.) Westbrook says thather friends have advised her to stop worrying. After all, her vacation is taking place half a world away and on a different cruise line, even if it’s owned by the same company. But she says it’s difficult, although “it looks like I don’t have much of a choice.” It’s too bad that the survivors had to wait until the Concordia sank before they discovered that they have few rights of redress. And too bad it took a maritime disaster to reveal to other cruise passengers that they have virtually the same problem.

BEIJING — As wind and rain lashed the Eastern Star cruise ship Monday night and lightning illuminated the sky, 43-year-old tour guide Zhang Hui was making his way back to his cabin. It was just before 9:30, and many of the elderly members of his tour group had gone to bed. Suddenly, the storm on the Yangtze River transformed into a freak tornado. Water started seeping into rooms, even through closed windows, Zhang recalled. Then, the boat listed 45 degrees, sending bottles skidding off tables and onto the floor. “It looks like we have run into big trouble,” he told a colleague, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. He had barely uttered the words when the boat listed again. Zhang had an instant to grab a life jacket and tumble out the window, as furniture and blankets hurtled toward him. Zhang is one of just 14 people, out of the 456 aboard, known to have survived what appears to be China’s worst shipping disaster in seven decades. More than 36 hours after the Eastern Star overturned, 13 bodies had been recovered and more than 425 people remained unaccounted for, authorities said. About 180 navy divers were joined by more than 110 rescue boats and six helicopters Tuesday night, battling wind, rain and darkness to look for anyone who might be clinging to life. After jumping out the window, Zhang, who cannot swim, saw several people in the waters around him, pleading for help. “I was submerged by one wave after another, and I drank a lot of water,” he told Xinhua from his hospital bed. “The raindrops hitting my face felt like hailstones.” At one point, another ship passed by, but its crew did not see him. “I told myself, it’ll be fine if I just hang in there a little longer,” he said. Zhang ended up drifting more than 50 miles downstream over the course of 10 hours before he rowed his way to shore at daybreak using tree branches. State radio said the four-decked ship overturned in just two minutes in a sudden tornado and did not issue a distress call. The alarm was raised only when a handful of survivors swam ashore. The captain of the vessel and the chief engineer were among the first to be rescued and were being questioned by police. State television showed rescue workers in orange jackets standing on the upturned hull of the ship. One was shown hammering on the hull, then pressing his ear to the rusty metal to listen for replies. Another worker used a power tool in an attempt to cut through the hull to reach people trapped in an air pocket who were reported to have been calling for help, according to state media. State media showed photographs of Premier Li Keqiang at the scene, apparently giving instructions to rescue workers. The instructions — from both Li and President Xi Jinping — “have fully shown how the party and government care for the public, and how the government puts the people’s interest above everything else,” Transport Minister Yang Chuantang said at a televised news conference. About 18 hours after the ship capsized, navy divers rescued a 65-year-old woman from deep inside its bowels, teaching her how to use breathing equipment before bringing her to the surface, as Li looked on. The death toll seemed likely to surpass that of the April 2014 sinking of a ferry in South Korea, when 304 people, most of them children, drowned. This is also likely to go down as the worst shipping disaster in China since the steamship Kiangya blew up on the Huangpu River in southeastern China in 1948, killing more than 1,000 people. Most passengers on the Eastern Star were 50 to 80 years old, state media reported. They were on an organized 11-day cruise along the Yangtze, Asia’s longest river, and its famous Three Gorges region. Xinhua said initial investigations established that the ship, licensed to carry 534 people, was not overloaded and that it had enough life jackets. Experts said China’s maritime safety record is relatively good, and regulations were further beefed up after the South Korean disaster. Extreme weather appeared to be the main culprit: China’s weather bureau said a small but intense tornado, lasting about 15 or 20 minutes, swept across the river as the ship passed. “There were life vests in prominent positions in every room, and the boat was open style,” Zhang said, according to Xinhua. “If it hadn’t capsized so fast, more people would have been saved.” Nevertheless, questions remained about why the vessel capsized so suddenly and why the captain apparently left his sinking ship so swiftly. Angry relatives of those aboard the ship gathered in Shanghai, from where many of the passengers had booked the tour. Some of the relatives briefly scuffled with officials over what they deemed a lack of communication, the news agency Reuters reported. Among them was Huang Yan, a 49-year-old accountant, who said she thinks her husband and father were on the ship. “Why did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?” she shouted, according to the Associated Press. Chutian Metropolis Daily, a local newspaper, reported that another tourist boat was cruising the same section of the river Monday night but decided to stop for the night near Hubei province after encountering bad weather. The Eastern Star carried on. Ship-positioning data showed that the vessel changed direction about 10 minutes before capsizing, the business magazine Caixin and state media reported, raising questions about whether that maneuver contributed to the disaster. Crew member Liu Yiqing, 43, was in charge of repairing and maintaining electric circuits and electronic equipment on the boat but had disembarked May 24 after his father was hospitalized. The decision probably saved Liu’s life. “At first, I really couldn’t believe that such a disaster would happen to the people around me,” he told Xinhua. “They were my brothers and sisters, and we ate together only a few days ago. We work together all year round and have very deep affection for each other. It is so painful.” The boat sank in 50 feet of water, about 110 miles west of Hubei’s capital, Wuhan, and about 700 miles south of Beijing. When he reached the shore, Zhang crawled up the bank on his hands and knees. He was so exhausted he could barely stand. Later, he telephoned his wife and teenage son. “I’m still alive,” he told them, as they choked with tears. Xinhua did not say whether Zhang’s colleague, with whom he was chatting as the boat listed, also survived. Gu Jinglu and Xu Yangjingjing contributed to this report.

Glasses and wine bottles crashed to the floor in pieces, the lights went dark, passengers screamed and the Costa Concordia began to list against the rock into which it had plowed. Then emergency lights came on, waiters began serving dinner plates and people were told everything was under control — it was no more than a simple generator failure. The surreal last hours aboard the doomed Italian cruise ship — a swirl of confusion, bad information, clueless and panicking crew members — were described in detail Wednesday by a Massachusetts couple who survived the ordeal. Through it all, from the jarring crash that disrupted their dinner until their lifeboat narrowly escaped, Divya and Sameer Sharma said they never heard a word from the ship’s captain, received helpful instructions from any crew member or were told the truth about what had happened. Theirs was a vivid description of the Jan. 13 accident in which a showboating captain ran his 952-foot ship onto the rocks 300 yards off the coast of an Italian island and left an inept crew and bewildered passengers to fend for themselves in the dark as the vessel began to roll onto its side. Twenty-five people died and seven remain missing. The hearing before the House maritime subcommittee was primarily geared toward reassuring testimony that the $35 billion North American cruise ship industry is the safest on earth. “There was nothing wrong with the ship. This was a very good ship. There is nothing wrong with our ships,” said Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), a former tugboat captain on the Yukon River. Committee members and most of the testimony laid the blame squarely on the captain, Francesco Schettino, who took the ship five miles off course and abandoned it before all the passengers and crew had escaped. Testimony from a U.S. Coast Guard admiral, cruise industry lobbyists, a maritime union, a cruise ship captain and cruise line officials all agreed that cruise ships of all nations operating out of U.S. ports are better inspected, that crews are better trained and that much more rigid guidelines prepare passengers for emergencies that may require them to abandon ship. “We have the most rigorous examination process in the world,” said Coast Guard Vice Adm. Brian M. Salerno. “This is a safe industry, objectively speaking.” Committee members and industry officials said the sinking of the Costa Concordia, owned by a subsidiary of Miami-based cruise operator Carnival, has prompted a review and upgrading of cruise line safety programs. But even as lawmakers heard testimony, another ship owned by Costa Cruises, the Costa Allegra, was being towed to port in the Indian Ocean after suffering a fire and losing power this week. The Sharmas told the committee that they received no safety instructions when they boarded and that they stumbled upon their life jackets by accident when hanging up clothes in their cabin locker before heading to dinner. “As we had just ordered our appetizers, there was a violent shaking of the ship followed by loud crash noises as the plates and glasses broke due to the listing of the ship,” Divya Sharma said. The lights went out and “everyone nearby started to scream.” When emergency lights came on, there was an announcement that everything was under control, she said, “and the staff began bringing out everyone’s food as if nothing bad had happened.” When the Sharmas saw some dining room crew begin to panic and cry, they returned to their cabin and stumbled around in the darkness to get their life jackets. Divya Sharma does not know how to swim. Another announcement urged calm, said the problem was under control and to await instructions, but “there was a sense of panic in the announcer’s voice,” Divya Sharma said. “The reason that the announcements were made on ‘behalf’ of the captain is because the captain wasn’t there.” A state room attendant snapped at them to stay in their cabin, but they made their way to the lifeboat deck. Although it was almost an hour after the accident, they were ordered back to their cabin. “People started to panic and get frustrated as the ship was tilting more,” Divya Sharma said. They said that they rushed into a lifeboat and then were ordered out because it was overcrowded but that they held their places. When the boat reached the water, its engine belched blue smoke and ran in circles. As it puttered ineffectively, the listing ship appeared about to topple and crush them. People began to panic, but finally the lifeboat inched clear. “We trusted the crew members and this captain with our lives,” Divya Sharma said. “No one deserves to die on their vacation.”	321	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 572, ""text"": ""es and wine bottles crashed to the floor in pieces, the lights went dark, passengers screamed and the Costa Concordia began to list against the rock into which it had plowed.

After the U.S. Coast Guard called off the search for a Virginia Tech senior who fell from a Carnival cruise ship this weekend, a U.S. senator said Cameron Smook didn’t have to die. Smook had boarded the Carnival Glory with friends Saturday, and on Sunday the company informed the family that he was missing at sea, the family wrote in a public statement to the Virginia Tech community after learning that the extensive air and sea search had ended. Read more about Cameron Smook here. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement, “Today, as our thoughts and prayers with the family and friends of Cameron Smook, the stark tragic fact is that readily available life-saving technology could have spared him.” He added: “Reprehensibly, five years after the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010 was enacted, cruise lines still refuse to upgrade outdated video surveillance technology for the latest in automatic man overboard detection. “The cruise industry should be ashamed and embarrassed by this failure to embrace this lifesaving technology. “Such technology could have immediately detected Cameron’s fall and made sure valuable time was not wasted reviewing camera footage. In the last two months four individuals have fallen overboard from cruise ships.” A spokeswoman for Carnival Cruise Lines forwarded a request for a response to Blumenthal to the Cruise Lines International Association, which speaks for the industry as a whole. The industry group issued a statement, which said safety of passengers and crew are a top priority, and said: “Our thoughts are with the family of the young man who is missing. “While incidents of man overboard in the cruise industry are rare, and typically found to be the result of an intentional or reckless act, cruise lines take a number of steps to help prevent such situations. These include mandatory railing heights, well-trained personnel, and video cameras.” It cited statistics from a maritime research and analysis firm in London that overboard incidents have declined by 50 percent from 2009 to 2013, and that year there were 13 people who fell overboard out of 21 million passengers. “Current law requires cruise lines to integrate technology that can be used for capturing images of passengers or detecting passengers who have gone overboard, to the extent such technology is available,” the statement said. “To date, no man-overboard detection system has shown to perform reliably enough for wide-scale deployment.  The industry does continue to assess, develop and trial such technologies in collaboration with maritime authorities.” Smook, who had expected to graduate in May with a degree in mining and mineral engineering, was warmly remembered by faculty members for “his energy, his spirit, and his ability to make others laugh,” according to a release from the university: “Emily Sarver, an assistant professor of mining engineering, recalled Smook from several classes that he took under her during his sophomore and senior years, including this most recent semester. “’Cameron was a student in one of the first classes I taught in the mining engineering department. I am so fond of him. I can remember his smile on the first day of class – friendly, interested, a bright spirit. I got to know him well over the past few years, and I’m grateful for that,'” she said. “‘He was one of those students who would crack a joke in class, but it was always appropriate and appreciated. Light sense of humor, and so well liked by his peers. He had great potential to do good things in the mining community. We’re like a little family here in mining, and Cameron will be sorely missed. Our very best wishes are with his family at this difficult time.’” “Added Greg Adel, department head of mining and minerals engineering: ‘Cameron was an excellent student and an outstanding young man. He was about to embark on a career with Martin Marietta Corp. after graduation. He had a wonderful future ahead of him and this is truly a sad day.'”	320	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 179, ""text"": ""he U.S. Coast Guard called off the search for a Virginia Tech senior who fell from a Carnival cruise ship this weekend, a U.S. senator said Cameron Smook didn’t have to di"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 541, ""end"": 725, ""text"": ""oday, as our thoughts and prayers with the family and friends of Cameron Smook, the stark tragic fact is that readily available life-saving technology could have spared him.” He added"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 728, ""end"": 1193, ""text"": ""Reprehensibly, five years after the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010 was enacted, cruise lines still refuse to upgrade outdated video surveillance technology for the latest in automatic man overboard detection. “The cruise industry should be ashamed and embarrassed by this failure to embrace this lifesaving technology. “Such technology could have immediately detected Cameron’s fall and made sure valuable time was not wasted reviewing camera footage"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1195, ""end"": 1274, ""text"": ""n the last two months four individuals have fallen overboard from cruise ships"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	328	2023-03-29T09:38:55.707058Z	2023-03-29T09:38:55.707178Z	311.863
The remarkable thing about the proposed Cruise Passenger Protection Act is that on its face, it looks entirely unremarkable. The law would require cruise lines to publicly report all alleged crimes on a ship and to disclose their passenger contracts in plain English. But dive into the bill, and it delivers a little shock to both passengers and the cruise industry. For travelers, it’s the surprise that, thanks to a legal loophole, cruise lines and the federal government currently don’t do what the new law would require, including publicly reporting every alleged and significant crime committed aboard cruise ships. It’s also a troubling reminder that at sea, you don’t have the same rights as on land. For cruise lines, the bill’s passage would significantly tighten the government’s regulatory screws — a step that the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), says is urgently needed. “I’m convinced that the only way we’re going to make a meaningful difference for consumers is by taking legislative action,” he said in a prepared statement. “We need to make sure this industry gives consumers all the information they need to make a fully informed decision before they book a cruise vacation.” The Cruise Passenger Protection Act was introduced in late July, just before what was expected to be a contentious congressional hearing on the cruise industry’s lack of consumer protections. On the agenda: the need for accurate crime reporting and the issue of safety problems that continue to plague the industry. Instead, the cruise industry took many observers aback by agreeing to voluntarily adopt at least one provision of the bill, a step some industry-watchers believe was meant to render the new law moot. “I was blindsided,” says maritime attorney and cruise industry critic Jim Walker, who attended the hearing. “For eight years, the cruise industry has been saying how safe it is, how heavily regulated it is. “I think they knew that this bill would pass.” Practically speaking, here’s what the industry’s preemptive compliance means: Three major cruise lines — Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line — have voluntarily published on their Web sites a list of major crimes allegedly committed aboard their ships. The reportable crimes include homicides, suspicious deaths, missing persons, kidnappings, assault with “serious” injury, theft of more than $10,000, rape and sexual assault. Previously, these crimes were reported to the Coast Guard, but thanks to a late revision in another bill, only cases that the FBI considered closed needed to be made public. That left passengers with the impression that their vessels were practically crime-free. On its Web site, Norwegian has reported just two alleged crimes on its ships for the first half of 2013: an assault on a passenger involving “serious” bodily injury and one sexual assault. For the past three months, a period when it carried 380,000 passengers, it claims to have a spotless record. The other cruise lines also reported very low crime rates. Carnival claimed just 10 alleged reportable crimes in the last quarter, and Royal Caribbean only six. Rockefeller said that after reviewing the information published online, he believes that “it falls short of what passengers need to make an informed decision about potential safety issues on their vacations.” Specifically, it fails to include reports of sexual crimes against minors. But to the cruise industry, Norwegian’s two incidents reflect the reality of life at sea. By any measure, travel aboard a commercial cruise line is “exceptionally safe,” says David Peikin, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association, an industry trade group. “In many areas, cruising offers passengers more protections and transparency of information than any other hospitality or transportation business.” The cruise industry has taken the concerns of passengers and legislators seriously, he notes. In May, for example, CLIA’s member lines adopted a set of voluntary policies that set minimum standards for safety, comfort and care in the event of a mechanical failure or a shipboard emergency. The Passenger Bill of Rights, Peikin noted, is a legally enforceable agreement between a cruise line and its guests. But some consumer advocates are unimpressed with the cruise industry’s voluntary steps. They say that cruise lines have fought common-sense crime reporting for the better part of a decade and agreed to take these steps only because Congress was about to force their hand. “Cruise lines won’t give anything up unless they have to,” says Kendall Carver, chairman of the International Cruise Victims Association, which represents cruise passengers. The issue is far from resolved. The Cruise Passenger Protection Act contains several provisions that, taken together, would significantly increase government oversight. They include the creation of an advisory committee for passenger vessel consumer protection and the addition of a new director-level position within the Transportation Department to act as a liaison between victims of cruise crime and the federal government. Among other things, the law authorizes the secretary of homeland security to withhold or revoke the clearance required to operate a cruise ship if a company doesn’t report its crimes or fails to pay a penalty. In effect, the DOT would become the lead federal agency for cruise ship consumer protection, not unlike the role it plays in aviation consumer protection. The bill would also give the federal government the authority to investigate consumer complaints. The cruise lines say that they are reviewing the bill. Passengers are, too. “It’s definitely headed in the right direction,” says Rob Qualls, who runs a diagnostic sensors equipment company in Indianapolis. He believes that the bill puts some much-needed accountability on an industry that has operated outside the law for too long. The plain-English passenger contract alone makes it worthwhile, because it will notify passengers of their rights — something they often don’t know. Whether the cruise industry’s lobbyists manage to defeat the Cruise Passenger Protection Act or not, we can be grateful that, however briefly, a legislative spotlight has illuminated what some say is one of the least understood, if not the least regulated, sectors of the travel industry.

On Friday morning we finally saw them, those wretched refugees of the Carnival Triumph, after five days stranded at sea. They disembarked the floating Port-a-John on which they had been imprisoned, some wearing white cruise line bathrobes to protect themselves against the unexpected chill, kneeling to kiss the ground as they came ashore. “United States,” a woman in a floppy hat breathed ecstatically to a television reporter. “Ain’t nothing better.” A cruise represents not only a vacation, but a very specific kind of vacation. One books it when one does not want to have to decide, or plan, or worry, or change money, or get tetanus shots. The people who would take a cruise have considered hiking through Nepal, cycling through Norway, staying at quaint little flophouses in Eastern Europe — it’s not like they don’t know those travel options exist — and thought, “No.” They do not believe that getting your wallet stolen in Mexico City is “a good story.” I have cruised, and I loved it, and so I say fondly: A cruise ship’s passenger log is comprised entirely of the exact demographic that is least prepared for a cruise to go to pot. A cruise is a giant boat full of your mother-in-law. Your mother-in-law does not belong in the wild. What happened: Midway through a four-day Mexican cruise, the Triumph’s engine room caught fire, the ship lost power, and then suddenly it was just drifting, somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. A four-day trip became an eight-day one. A 102,000-ton boat, the length of three football fields and containing 4,000 passengers, was reduced to Huck Finn’s raft. It took three days for some gallant little tugboats to tow it into port in Mobile, Ala. There was nothing for watchers at home to do but imagine the hellscape aboard the doomed vessel. But now the survivors are back, ready to share what really happened. On the “Today” show, Matt Lauer encouraged two female passengers to tell him everything. But everything, edited. “Not too graphic,” he warned them. This was, after all, a morning show. The women appeared briefly flummoxed, trying to figure out how to tell a G-rated version of the story. “It was, like, post-natural disaster,” Julie Billings said finally. “But stuck on a boat.” Excuse us, Matt Lauer, but how could the story not be graphic? The filth, the waste, the rapid decline, is precisely what made the saga so horrifying for viewers and readers at home. We hung onto every bleated-out text message of despair, every description of what they were eating, and where they were sleeping, and where their waste went. (In red plastic bags. Marked with hazardous-waste symbols. Left outside state rooms. In ice buckets.We saw pictures.) It was a drama, but not of danger. It was a drama of discomfort. The smell. Just think of the smell.Skip this paragraph if you don’t want to think of the smell. The unrefrigerated food and the unrefreshed bodies, the uncirculated dankness of the cabins, so filthy that passengers began sleeping on deck chairs instead, lugging their pillows to some high-thread-count open-air slumber party. “I’m just happy to be alive,” a woman told “Good Morning America.” Hell is other people. Hell is other people on a boat. What will it take before we accept this? After David Foster Wallace writes about it in an erudite essay? After a Concordia captain abandons his sinking ship? After a New York Times reporter mentions that his journey on the classy Cunard was delayed for several hours so workers could scrub the ship down after a norovirus outbreak? It’s over now, all over. Carnival put the passengers on buses, heading either to New Orleans or to their origin point of Galveston, Tex. The company had promised to cover all travel expenses home. And to give each passenger $500 in compensation. As well as a credit. A credit for another cruise.	318	"[{""start"": 3, ""end"": 119, ""text"": ""day morning we finally saw them, those wretched refugees of the Carnival Triumph, after five days stranded at sea"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1258, ""end"": 1848, ""text"": ""Midway through a four-day Mexican cruise, the Triumph’s engine room caught fire, the ship lost power, and then suddenly it was just drifting, somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico.

BEIJING — Relatives of those who died aboard a cruise ship that sank on the Yangtze River expressed bitterness and dismay after the Chinese government issued an ­official report this week principally blaming bad weather for a disaster that killed 442 people. Although the government also recommended that the captain and 43 other people face punishment for their roles in the sinking of the Eastern Star, relatives said the government appeared to be playing down human error to avoid embarrassment. “The whole report is a lie, and they made it up to escape responsibility,” said a 63-year-old man whose wife drowned in the sinking. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid harassment by police. “I just feel deeply helpless. There was no transparency in the investigation.” The ship’s captain was among 12 who survived China’s worst peacetime maritime disaster, which occurred on the evening of June 1 during a 10-day cruise on the Yangtze. The cabinet’s investigative team concluded that the disaster was “caused by strong winds and heavy rains resulting from a squall line accompanied by a downburst, a very rare weather phenomenon,” the official Xinhua News Agency said. Xinhua said the investigators “suggested” that 43 people — including local government and Communist Party officials, maritime regulators and shipping company executives — be given administrative punishments, which could include demotions and firings. It also recommended that the professional certification of the ship’s captain, Zhang Shunwen, be revoked and that legal authorities investigate whether he should face criminal charges. But relatives of several victims said the report appeared to play down or ignore what they considered to be the criminal responsibility of various people for allowing a ship they described as unsafe to ply the river. “This report has obviously played up the role of weather but hidden the responsibilities of the administration and business,” said a woman whose mother died in the sinking. “The real reasons for the accident were not shown until the end of the report,” she said, citing references to unsafe modifications to the ship, a lack of maintenance, and inadequate crew training and preparation for emergencies. “Nobody has been charged with any crimes.” Other relatives said the report appeared to ignore the question of whether the captain and surviving crew members had abandoned ship too early. “If they had time to escape, why didn’t they inform the passengers?” said Zheng Qian, whose husband’s parents died on the vessel. Zheng said relatives had been contacted by the government to ask whether they had questions about the report. “We have a lot of questions,” she said, adding that she and her husband wanted to see the evidence and data that led investigators to their conclusion. “We don’t trust the report,” she added. “We think the problem is the ship. It was all because of the ship and the captain.” Victims’ relatives have long complained of a lack of information during the investigation and about being asked to sign away their right to ask questions in return for compensation. Their efforts to get information have been met with obstruction, harassment and surveillance, they say. “The investigative team has never let relatives get involved or allowed an independent investigative organization in,” the 63-year-old man said. “They closed the door and investigated themselves. How can we trust their report? It’s like the person who makes mistakes scrutinized himself and cleared himself.” Many relatives have faulted Zhang, the captain, for continuing the ship’s journey during the storm when two nearby vessels dropped anchor. The report said that the captain had tried to stabilize the ship but that the vessel was overwhelmed by a sudden burst of wind and rain and capsized in about a minute, Xinhua reported. But the investigators also said that the captain and his chief mates had “insufficient knowledge” about extreme weather and possible dangers and that they “responded inadequately.” The Eastern Star was built in 1994 for passenger transport, was converted into a cruise ship in 1997 and reconstructed in 2008. The ship’s ability to withstand strong winds was reduced to a certain extent by those modifications but was still in line with official requirements, said Wu Yousheng, a shipping expert who participated in the probe, Xinhua reported. Nevertheless, the ship was insufficiently stable to withstand the storm, in which winds reached Level 12 on the Beaufort scale — more than 73 mph, or hurricane force — in a short time and rain fell at a rate of nearly four inches an hour. Relatives said the ship and crew were clearly not prepared for rough weather and should not have been on the river. “I felt a chill when I saw the news,” said Candy Tang, 35, whose 6-year-old daughter died. “The result is not surprising. I can do nothing about it. I’m exhausted.” Xu Jing contributed to this report.	317	"[{""start"": 8, ""end"": 258, ""text"": ""— Relatives of those who died aboard a cruise ship that sank on the Yangtze River expressed bitterness and dismay after the Chinese government issued an ­official report this week principally blaming bad weather for a disaster that killed 442 people."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 259, ""end"": 498, ""text"": ""Although the government also recommended that the captain and 43 other people face punishment for their roles in the sinking of the Eastern Star, relatives said the government appeared to be playing down human error to avoid embarrassment."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 948, ""end"": 1179, ""text"": ""The cabinet’s investigative team concluded that the disaster was “caused by strong winds and heavy rains resulting from a squall line accompanied by a downburst, a very rare weather phenomenon,” the official Xinhua News Agency said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2008, ""end"": 2235, ""text"": ""The real reasons for the accident were not shown until the end of the report,” she said, citing references to unsafe modifications to the ship, a lack of maintenance, and inadequate crew training and preparation for emergencies"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3859, ""end"": 4039, ""text"": ""But the investigators also said that the captain and his chief mates had “insufficient knowledge” about extreme weather and possible dangers and that they “responded inadequately.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3535, ""end"": 3672, ""text"": ""Many relatives have faulted Zhang, the captain, for continuing the ship’s journey during the storm when two nearby vessels dropped anchor"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4641, ""end"": 4755, ""text"": ""Relatives said the ship and crew were clearly not prepared for rough weather and should not have been on the river"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4040, ""end"": 4401, ""text"": ""he Eastern Star was built in 1994 for passenger transport, was converted into a cruise ship in 1997 and reconstructed in 2008.

The Carnival Pride cruise ship struck a gangway as the ship was docking in Baltimore on Sunday morning, sending the gangway crashing down on three parked vehicles. Some passengers said they felt a thud as the bow of the ship struck the gangway but they weren’t sure what it was. No one was injured in the incident and the pickup trucks that were crushed were unoccupied, officials said. Some on the cruise, which was returning from an eight-day trip to the Bahamas, said they weren’t too concerned about the incident after learning no one was hurt. “Accidents happen,” said Esther Smith, of Wellsville, Pa. She and her husband, Eric Smith, were celebrating her 50th birthday on the cruise. “The fact that no one was hurt changed the whole mood of it,” Eric Smith said. No one was using the gangway, which is used by passengers to get on and off the ship, when the ship made contact with it, said Jennifer De La Cruz, a spokeswoman for Carnival. The pickup trucks belong to cruise employees. The Carnival Pride is one of two cruise ships that have a home port in Baltimore, port spokesman Richard Scher said. The incident caused minor damage to the ship, but De la Cruz said it planned to deport on time Sunday afternoon for another cruise. Passengers getting on and off the ship had to use a crew gangway at the pier level. “I was just so thankful that no one was hurt,” said Michele Church, 56, of Wilmington, Del. She saw the aftermath of the incident from her ninth-floor room. “Because someone could easily got killed.” Nicole Newsome, a friend of Church’s from Wilmington who was part of an eight-person group of friends, said she felt a “hard thump” when the gangway was struck. “We just thought that’s what happens when you dock,” said Newsome, 45. Carol Francis, 68, of Towson said it sounded like a “big boom” and was initially concerned about someone being trapped in the truck that was crushed. But she said she wasn’t worried for her own safety. “It wasn’t like we were in the middle of the ocean,” she said.	316	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 162, ""text"": ""nival Pride cruise ship struck a gangway as the ship was docking in Baltimore on Sunday morning, sending the gangway crashing down on three parked vehicle"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	324	2023-03-29T08:58:06.264112Z	2023-03-29T08:58:06.264183Z	171.225
As Carnival Corp. announced plans to salvage the Costa Concordia last week, the world’s attention focused again on cruise safety — or rather, the lack of it. The Concordia struck a reef off the coast of Italy in January and partially sank, claiming the lives of 32 passengers. Carnival will refloat the hull in a $300 million salvage operation said to be the largest in history. Coincidentally, it’s been almost two years since the passage of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, a law that promised to make cruising safer by requiring cruise lines to install peepholes in cabin doors, improve the handling of crime evidence and report crimes to the Coast Guard and the FBI. Given that travelers are thinking about security on cruise ships and that the summer vacation season is just around the corner, there’s no better time to ask whether the rules are working as intended. But that’s a hard question to answer. The law couldn’t have prevented the sinking of the Concordia, for example. That was reportedly caused when its captain, Francesco Schettino, foolishly steered his vessel away from its programmed route to do a maneuver known as a sail-by salute. And common sense can’t be legislated, as they say. But what about some of the other provisions? David Peikin, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), a cruise industry trade group, wouldn’t comment on whether the law is working but insisted that cruising is safe and that passenger safety remains the industry’s “number one” priority. Peikin pointed to several independent studies showing even before the law went into effect that the cruise experience was exceedingly safe and said that cruise lines are reporting crimes to the government as required. I wondered what others thought, so I revisited some of my sources from a 2010 column on the act. Interestingly, that story also featured a quote from a CLIA spokesman about safety being the No. 1 priority. Kendall Carver, chairman of the International Cruise Victims Association, a passenger advocacy group, doesn’t think that the law has helped passengers. “It’s a travesty,” he said. In just the past month, several stories have raised serious concerns about cruise ship safety. A TV exposé about alcohol consumption on cruise ships showed passengers on a Royal Caribbean vessel drinking during a mandatory safety briefing. Royal Caribbean denounced the report as “sensationalistic” and said that it trains its staff in how to serve alcohol to guests in a responsible way. Also, five men in St. Kitts went on trial for robbing 17 cruise passengers on a shore excursion in 2010. The suspects are accused of taking money, phones and jewelry from the passengers in a crime that the St. Kitts & Nevis Observer called “the most infamous crime in St. Kitts in recent time.” And then there’s actor John Travolta, who is reportedly being sued for sexual harassment by Fabian Zanzi, a former cruise line employee. The star of “Pulp Fiction” is accused of accosting Zanzi on a Royal Caribbean ship and offering him $12,000 for sex. Are any of these incidents being reported to the FBI and the Coast Guard? Not exactly. Some of these alleged crimes didn’t take place on cruise ships, so they’re excluded. Others happened before the current reporting requirements went into effect. Peikin says that these incidents, as well as the Costa disaster, have nothing to do with the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act. “There is no connection between the two,” he says. Fair point. But a look at the cruise ship crime statistics that are reported (if you can find them on the Coast Guard Web site) raises other concerns. In the Coast Guard’s latest report, which covers Jan. 1 through March 31, cruise lines disclosed just three incidents involving missing persons and alleged crimes. In the previous quarter, they also reported only three, and in the one before that, zero. In all, cruise lines have reported only 19 crimes to the government since 2011 — a number that to some seems improbably low. One who thinks it’s too low is James Walker, a maritime lawyer based in Miami. “These numbers are even less than the number of crimes the cruise lines will admit occurred,” he says. Back in 2006, Royal Caribbean told Congress that in the previous three years, 66 rapes and sexual assaults had been reported, he says. But in a civil case that Walker’s firm handled, a court ordered the cruise line to produce its raw crime data, which showed that the total number of reported sex-related crimes was actually around 273 — a number that included allegations of sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual harassment and inappropriate touching. The International Cruise Victims Association’s Carver is also skeptical of the crime statistics. He alleges that the actual number of crimes is hundreds of times higher. “That’s the most disappointing part of the new law,” he says. “The statistical database is largely incomplete.” The problem is a loophole in the law, which stipulates that the FBI doesn’t have to include open files in crime statistics. As long as a case isn’t closed, it doesn’t get reported. “Many travel agents are now marketing cruises by referring their clients to the Coast Guard database for the proposition that there are virtually no crimes at all on cruise ships,” Walker adds. “It makes a mockery of the law.” All this makes it difficult to say whether the law is working. There were no comprehensive, publicly reported crime statistics for the cruise industry before the act went into force. And if industry critics are to be believed, no reliable numbers that passengers could compare those crime figures with are being disclosed today, anyway. So it’s impossible to know whether all the other items the act requires — the peepholes, the evidence handling, the additional rights granted victims to sue a cruise line — are doing any good. But that may not be the worst part. With only a few lonely voices, such as Carver and Walker, who advocate primarily for victims, cruise passengers have no organized lobbying presence in Washington to raise their concerns. CLIA spent nearly $2 million lobbying Congress last year, slightly less than what it spent in 2010, which was a record. And that doesn’t include individual lobbying by large cruise lines such as Carnival ($710,000 in 2011) and Royal Caribbean ($1.1 million). So we’re in the same place we were in before the passage of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act: with no idea how safe a floating vacation actually is. The cruise industry insists that it’s more secure than any land vacation. Critics say that it’s one of the riskier trips you can take. The truth probably lies somewhere in between.

After a harrowing and unhygienic five days of floating in the Gulf of Mexico without power or flushing toilets, the Carnival Triumph finally managed to drag her sorry stern back to port in Mobile, Ala., a little over a week ago The last time the same sort of mishap — an engine-room fire — occurred was in 2010 on another Carnival ship, the Splendor. The next time this happens. . . . Well, will there be a next time? For perspective on the situation, the Travel section contacted two cruise industry experts: Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor at Cruise Critic, and Jay Herring, author of “The Truth About Cruise Ships” and a former senior officer with Carnival Cruises. How common are engine room fires and other meltdowns on cruise ships? Herring: Cruising is very safe. These incidents are very rare — maybe once a year, once every couple of years. You’re more likely to be hurt driving to the cruise ship terminal than are you actually being on a cruise. Brown: Engine room fires happen, but 99 percent of the time passengers aren’t affected. Is Carnival to blame? Herring: It could happen anywhere. Any ship at sea is at risk for a mishap. How serious was the situation? Herring: On a scale of 1 to 10, Costa was a 10. [Last year’s Costa Concordia accident in Italy caused 32 deaths.] This is a 5 or 6. Did Carnival handle the disaster well? Brown: This is a textbook case of how not to react. Nothing about the handling of the situation seemed well done. Any heroes deserve a mention? Brown: The crew kept everyone safe. The cruise line had better be generous to the crew. Do you think Carnival’s compensation package — reimbursement for the trip, credit twoard a future cruise and $500 — is fair? Herring: I think the compensation is more than adequate. Will this event affect future bookings? Brown: Not only virgins [newbie cruisers] but people who have cruised before are skittish. It’s a challenge to get past it. But if we can get past Costa, we can get past this. Any advice for people now nervous about cruising? Brown: Any ship designed after 2010 must have two engine rooms. If you have any concern, go for a ship that has this new feature. Would you still sail Carnival? Brown: I would take Carnival tomorrow. This was an aberration.

BEIJING — Divers battled submerged debris and crews sliced into the upturned hull of a Chinese cruise liner Wednesday in a last-ditch hunt for survivors two days after the ship capsized with 456 people aboard. Early Thursday, the Chinese state television reported that the death toll had climbed to 75, leaving more than 360 people still unaccounted for. Just 14 people are known to have survived the disaster on the Yangtze River. Most were retirement-age tourists on an 11-day cruise. In the water, a tumble of beds, tables and chairs blocked divers’ access into the capsized Eastern Star. Some cabin doors also were locked, officials said, making the job of finding survivors and retrieving bodies significantly harder. Atop the hull, rescue teams began cutting through the metal in an attempt to find anyone who might be trapped in air pockets, the official People’s Daily reported. Amid the search, questions emerged about whether the boat, which had four decks and a relatively shallow draft, had been sufficiently stable to withstand stormy weather. Also facing scrutiny is its captain, who continued the cruise as rain and wind intensified Monday night — even while other vessels dropped anchor. The captain and his chief engineer were among the first to be rescued. Police are questioning them. But the Chinese government, ever wary that public outrage could be turned against the authorities, attempted to control the narrative. Officials discouraged local journalists from visiting the scene and tried to prevent foreign journalists from speaking to passengers’ relatives. China’s Internet police issued warnings against those who sought to point fingers or spread malicious rumors online. Censors deleted critical comments on social media. The government’s main focus, however, remained on the rescue effort, with nearly 2,000 workers, more than 100 boats and 200 divers deployed in what could be China’s worst ship-related disaster in nearly seven decades. Helicopters and planes scoured the waters of the Yangtze as the search area expanded to 135 miles downstream. Transport Ministry spokesman Xu Chengguang said that divers would continue searching for survivors and try to move the vessel only when more salvage boats arrived. “Our number one priority is to rescue people,” he said at a televised news conference. “As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we will not give up.” But Xu said that strong currents, wind and waves made the job harder. Sand and mud kicked up by the storm reduced visibility underwater. Diver Zhang Hucheng said he and his colleagues stay underwater for an hour at a time. “Now we are completely relying on our hands to search,” he told the official Xinhua News Agency. “Even though we have strong torchlights, the river water is very muddy. We can’t see anything.” Two people, including a 65-year-old woman, were brought out alive from air pockets inside the vessel Tuesday after rescuers apparently heard voices yelling for help. Xinhua showed images of bodies in yellow bags being ferried away by military rescue workers. Premier Li Keqiang, the Communist Party’s point man in disasters, was photographed bowing before two bodies covered in white shrouds. Li has also been photographed poring over maps, directing rescue workers and meeting survivors, to demonstrate, in the words of officials, how genuinely the government “cares for the people.” According to China Digital Times, a Web site dedicated to detailing media censorship, the government issued a directive to domestic news organizations not to send reporters to the scene and instead to rely on official media. “Reporters already there must be immediately recalled,” the directive said. “All coverage must use information released by authoritative media as the standard.” Nevertheless, some reporters from outside the state mouthpieces turned up, according to foreign journalists in the area. In 2011, journalists and others used social media to break news of a high-speed train crash in the eastern city of Wenzhou in which 40 people died and ask uncomfortable questions about safety. The resulting investigation saw powerful heads roll in China’s Railways Ministry, which was subsequently dismantled. Ever since, the Communist Party has dramatically cracked down on freedom of speech online. On Wednesday, Internet police in the central province of Hubei, where the disaster occurred, denounced “lawless people who ignore the truth, maliciously spread rumors online and even send out scam texts to families of the victims.” On a social media account, authorities vowed to punish anyone who made up rumors. Internet police in the northeastern city of Shenyang said only people with “ulterior motives” or who were “dead evil” would want to point fingers at a time when the nation should be focused on the recovery effort. Some social media posts — later deleted by authorities — criticized the effort to control news reporting. Others complained that the captain of the Eastern Star had deserted his sinking ship. “The captain and crew members displayed 100 times better escaping skills than the passengers,” one user posted on a microblogging site. “The captain is so professional he escaped unscathed.” On Tuesday, angry relatives of the passengers gathered at a government office in Shanghai — from where many of the passengers had booked the tour — and demanded more information, some briefly scuffling with officials, according to the Reuters news agency. Many relatives were taken Wednesday to the rescue site at Jianli in central Hubei province and were briefed by officials. One of those aboard the vessel was Gao Qianyue, who had just celebrated her third birthday and was taking her first boat trip with her newly retired grandparents. “She is only 3 years old, and now she is soaked in water — please save her first,” the girl’s mother cried, according to local media, before pointing at her husband. “The three people he is closest to — his mom, his dad and his daughter — are all on the boat, with their life uncertain. What is he going to do? What should we do?” In Shanghai, Wang Sheng said he had paid for his 72-year-old father and 65-year-old mother to take the cruise to see the Three Gorges Dam but regretted he had not gone along. “My mom was reluctant to go,” he cried, according to Xinhua. “If only I had gone with my father. At least I am young and strong, and I can swim. Maybe I could even have saved him. I am so sorry.” Meanwhile, attention turned to the safety of the Eastern Star, a 251-foot-long and 36-foot-wide vessel, especially in stormy weather. “Our shipbuilding and design have not taken into consideration extreme weather conditions such as storms and tornadoes when building ships used for inland rivers,” said Liu Shuguang, deputy director in the College of Economics at the Ocean University of China in Qingdao. “The capsized boat has a quite shallow bottom but is very high. It is only suitable for calm and tranquil weather conditions,” Liu added. But the possibility of human error playing a role also appeared to grow after local media reported that three other ships nearby had dropped anchor as the storm intensified. “The visibility was terrible, like being in fog, and the rain was interfering with the radar so you couldn’t make anything out,” Li Yongjun, the captain of a freighter, told Xinhua. Li said he decided to slow down, drop anchor and wait out the storm. As he did so, the Eastern Star passed his ship and continued upriver.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s president said Monday that she will push to disband the coast guard in the wake of a ferry disaster last month that left more than 300 people dead or missing, calling its rescue operations after the disaster a failure. The coast guard has been under growing public criticism of its alleged poor search-and-rescue work after the ferry Sewol sank on April 16. Most of the victims were students from a high school near Seoul who were traveling to the southern tourist island of Jeju. “The coast guard’s rescue operations were virtually a failure,” President Geun-hye Park said in a nationally televised speech. She said she will push for legislation that would transfer the coast guard’s responsibilities to the National Police Agency and a new government body she plans to establish. Park also again apologized for the government’s handling of the sinking, one of the deadliest disasters in decades in South Korea. “The final responsibility for not properly dealing with this incident is placed on me,” she said. Park has apologized for the incident at least three times. About one month after the sinking, 286 bodies have been retrieved and 18 people are still missing. About 172 people, including 22 of the ship’s 29 crew members, survived. Prosecutors last week indicted the ferry’s 15 crew members who were tasked with navigating the ship, four on homicide charges.	312	"[{""start"": 7, ""end"": 252, ""text"": ""uth Korea — South Korea’s president said Monday that she will push to disband the coast guard in the wake of a ferry disaster last month that left more than 300 people dead or missing, calling its rescue operations after the disaster a failure"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 254, ""end"": 391, ""text"": ""The coast guard has been under growing public criticism of its alleged poor search-and-rescue work after the ferry Sewol sank on April 16"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 517, ""end"": 641, ""text"": ""The coast guard’s rescue operations were virtually a failure,” President Geun-hye Park said in a nationally televised speech"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1105, ""end"": 1402, ""text"": ""About one month after the sinking, 286 bodies have been retrieved and 18 people are still missing.
