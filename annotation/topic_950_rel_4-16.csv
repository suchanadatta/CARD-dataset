I’ve just posted a story online that takes a step back from the tragic death of Philip Seymour Hoffman and looks at the twinned epidemics of heroin and opioids. In many ways this is a disturbing story, because we all know people who have suffered from addiction and its often lethal consequences. This isn’t a topic I’ve written much about, so I’m learning a lot as I go. Let me add a bunch of links to the conversation. The CDC tracks overdose deaths, and what’s striking to my eye is the very large increase in overdoses from pharmaceuticals since 1999. “Drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2010. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle traffic crashes.” “Of the 22,134 deaths relating to prescription drug overdose in 2010, 16,652 (75%) involved opioid analgesics (also called opioid pain relievers or prescription painkillers), and 6,497 (30%) involved benzodiazepines.” Those are big numbers in a single year — far more than the slightly more than 3,000 deaths from heroin overdoses. Perplexing fact: A wide government survey shows that non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is flat for the past decade — and yet the overdoses have gone way up. What’s that about? See the survey here. Here’s a thought: Pill-popping of Vicodin and OxyContin, etc., among teenagers has dropped a bit, but the Baby Boomers are using more of them. Your average 50-something person is much more likely to be a user of illicit drugs than a 50-something person of a decade ago: “Among adults aged 50 to 64, the rate of current illicit drug use increased during the past decade. For adults aged 50 to 54, the rate increased from 3.4 percent in 2002 to 7.2 percent in 2012. Among those aged 55 to 59, the rate of current illicit drug use increased from 1.9 percent in 2002 to 6.6 percent in 2012. Among those aged 60 to 64, the rate increased from 1.1 percent in 2003 to 3.6 percent in 2012. These trends partially reflect the aging into these age groups of members of the baby boom cohort (i.e., persons born between 1946 and 1964), whose rates of illicit drug use have been higher than those of older cohorts.” Russell Brand has a good column on addiction in The Guardian. And here’s another one by Brand — zowie. “…the disease of addiction is not rational. Recently, for the purposes of a documentary on this subject, I reviewed some footage of myself smoking heroin. I sit wasted and slumped with an unacceptable haircut against a wall in another Hackney flat (Hackney is starting to seem like part of the problem), inhaling fizzy black snakes of smack off a scrap of crumpled foil. When I saw the tape a month or so ago, what was surprising was that my reaction was not one of gratitude for the positive changes I’ve experienced. Instead I felt envious of this earlier version of myself, unencumbered by the burden of abstinence. I sat in a suite at the Savoy hotel, in privilege, resenting the woeful ratbag I once was who, for all his problems, had drugs. That is obviously irrational, but the mentality and behaviour of drug addicts and alcoholics is wholly irrational until you understand that they are completely powerless over their addiction and, unless they have structured help, they have no hope.” Which brings up another terrific essay on addiction, by Seth Mnookin, in Slate: “Most adults with jobs and mortgages and spouses and kids can have a glass of wine after work. For me, a glass of wine is a gateway to my past—and that past provides a pretty robust pool of evidence that there’s not much separation between my having a drink and my ending up alone in an apartment with a needle in my arm.” At the Knight Science Journalism Tracker, a guest post discusses media coverage of the Hoffman case. Here’s the top of my story: The death last Sunday of Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman at age 46 focused media attention on the nationwide surge in heroin use and overdoses. But the very real heroin epidemic is framed by an even more dramatic increase since the beginning of the century in overdoses from pharmaceutical drugs known as opioids. These are, in effect, tandem epidemics — an addiction crisis driven by the powerful effects on the human brain of drugs derived from morphine. Prescription opioids are killing Americans at more than five times the rate that heroin is, according to the most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These drugs are sold under such familiar brand names as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet and can be found in medicine cabinets in every precinct of American society. They’re also sold illicitly on the street or crushed and laced into heroin. There have been numerous efforts by law enforcement agencies to crack down on “pill mills” that dispense massive amounts of the pharmaceuticals, as well as regulations aimed at preventing users from “doctor shopping” to find someone who will write a prescription. Those efforts have had the unintended effect, officials say, of driving some people to heroin in recent years as their pill supply dries up. The latest government survey of drug abuse shows a drop since 2010 in first-time users of illegally obtained OxyContin. But heroin use is up. It’s akin to pushing on a beanbag chair. Health officials in Maryland, for example, reported that in the first seven months of 2012, a 15 percent drop in pharmaceutical opioid overdoses was accompanied by a 41 percent increase in heroin overdoses. Market forces play a role in this drug substitution, as do the brutal realities of addiction and the need for a fix. Street heroin is much cheaper than a pharmaceutical — typically $10 a packet for heroin, compared with perhaps $80 on the street for an 80-milligram OxyContin, public health officials say. The stigma and lethality of street heroin — long viewed much more negatively than drugs such as cocaine, according to government surveys — are no deterrent to someone facing the agony of withdrawal from an opioid. “In the storm of narcotic withdrawal, any opiate port will do,” said Jim Hall, an epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University who studies addiction. Prescription painkillers may also grease a slippery slope toward a relapse for former heroin addicts. Hoffman appears to be a case in point. He was found with a needle in his arm and dozens of heroin packets in his Manhattan apartment. The autopsy and initial toxicology tests were inconclusive, and so the precise cause of Hoffman’s death — whether he overdosed on heroin alone, for example, or in combination with one or more other drugs — is pending further investigation. But the actor revealed last year that, after being clean for two decades, he suffered a relapse into heroin use after first taking prescription pills. “The main driver of overdoses right now in our country is from opioid medications, more than from heroin,” said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In 2010, according to the CDC, 3,036 people died in the United States from heroin overdoses, up from 1,960 in 1999. But 22,134 people died in 2010 from pharmaceutical drug overdoses, nearly triple the 7,523 deaths reported in 1999, according to the CDC. About three out of four of those overdoses — 16,652 — were from opioids. Most of the rest of the overdoses came from such drugs as Xanax, Valium and Ativan, which are used for anxiety or sleeplessness and are categorized scientifically as benzodiazepines. Most people who abuse pills don’t have legal prescriptions for them. They get them from family and friends, and sometimes from drug dealers. Young people may view them as safer than street drugs like heroin because they are manufactured as medicine and originate with doctors. “We have tried to shatter the myth that these are safe,” Volkow said. Young people are often the victim of chemical combinations they don’t understand, said Karen Hacker, director of the Allegheny County Health Department, which includes the city of Pittsburgh. They combine the pills with alcohol and other drugs. They may feel that snorting or smoking certain drugs is safer than injecting them. And they may not realize that slow-release opioid painkillers have long-lasting effects. “We had people going to sleep kind of drunk and literally not waking up in the morning,” Hacker said. Her county had a rash of 16 deaths between Jan. 17 and Jan. 30 from heroin laced with the opioid painkiller fentanyl, which is many times stronger than heroin. The chief medical examiner, Karl Williams, said that in the 1980s and 1990s Allegheny County would typically have about 100 overdoses annually, but in the late ’90s the numbers began steadily rising, and now there are about 250 overdoses each year. Even that huge rate of overdoses didn’t prepare the coroner for what he saw on Friday, Jan. 17, when three bodies were brought in with signs of heroin overdoses. The next day, Saturday, he saw four more cases, and then Sunday brought three more — 10 deaths in just three days. Laboratory tests showed that all had taken a lethal 50-50 mixture of cocaine and fentanyl. The overdoses from the fentanyl-laced heroin apparently have stopped, said Williams and Hacker — presumably because word got to users that they were in grave peril from heroin sold in plastic envelopes stamped “Theraflu” and “Bud Ice.”      	710	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 159, ""text"": ""t posted a story online that takes a step back from the tragic death of Philip Seymour Hoffman and looks at the twinned epidemics of heroin and opioids"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 421, ""end"": 938, ""text"": ""The CDC tracks overdose deaths, and what’s striking to my eye is the very large increase in overdoses from pharmaceuticals since 1999. “Drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2010.

THE PROGNOSIS Marijuana legalization is enjoying a surge of support, both among American voters and 2020 presidential candidates. But that enthusiasm has led to some hasty claims about the drug’s usefulness that aren’t borne out by research. Five years ago — as the country’s opioid crisis had just started garnering national attention — a study got a lot of buzz suggesting that opioid overdose deaths were 25 percent lower in states that had given the nod to medical marijuana. At the time, policymakers were starting to search for the best ways to respond to the crisis, and the public was just starting to learn about the so-called “Lazarus drug” Naloxone, which rapidly reverses opioid overdoses. But now, Stanford University researchers have released a new study finding the exact opposite: States that allowed marijuana use for medical purposes actually had 23 percent more deaths from opioid overdoses, when they looked over a longer period of time. “The new work appears to be a cautionary tale about inferring cause and effect — wanting research to show something it can’t because the nation is in the grip of a deadly opioid epidemic or because there is money to be made by offering possible solutions,” my Post colleague Lenny Bernstein writes. It was intriguing to think that the problem of opioid overdoses, which have taken more than American 400,000 lives in the past two decades, could have such a simple solution upon which states were already embarking. Thirty-three states plus the District of Columbia now allow the use of medical marijuana. Last week, New Mexico joined New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in approving it specifically for patients addicted to opioids. (Although not every state is embracing medical marijuana products. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) vetoed a bill last month that would have expanded a medical cannabidiol program allowing capsules and extracts, saying the state needs to “proceed cautiously” on changes.) South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, criticized the veto: The correlation between medical marijuana and lower opioid overdose seemed to be confirmed in a 2014 study by Johns Hopkins researchers, who found 24.8 percent fewer deaths in the period from 1999 to 2010 after states passed laws legalizing medical marijuana. The Stanford researchers came up with very similar results while looking at the same time period, but the data reversed once they extended the analysis to 2017. “A lot of people interpreted the first study as causal because it’s congenial to their goals,” Chelsea Shover, a postdoctoral fellow in psychiatry who was part of the Stanford research team, told Lenny. “It did not say that one is causing the other.” “I wish it were true,” she added. “I wish that passing medical cannabis [laws] would solve the opioid crisis. But the evidence doesn’t support that.” Shover told Lenny the conflicting results could be related to the fact that only 13 states had medical marijuana laws for the initial study, and many of them were in the West, where the opioid epidemic arrived later. Many more states had approved medical use of marijuana by the end of the study time period, leaving researchers with few states to use for comparison. Of course, marijuana could still hold some value for trying to combat opioid abuse — especially given the public’s increasing acceptance of it. Because it’s useful as a nonaddictive pain reliever, it can give doctors better options when seeking relief for their patients. Three in 4 Americans back medical marijuana, although it’s not yet recognized by the federal government as a medically beneficial drug. Support for recreational use of marijuana has also rapidly risen, with 2 out of 3 people now in favor of legalizing it broadly. The Democratic presidential candidates have been paying close attention to public opinion. The field of 2020 candidates nearly all agree marijuana should be decriminalized. Former vice president Joe Biden, who for years opposed the idea, said last month that people shouldn’t be prosecuted for smoking marijuana and added that as president he would allow states to keep making their own decisions on the matter. Even former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, one of the moderate Democrats in the race, signed some marijuana laws in his state after initially characterizing the legalization of recreational pot as “reckless.” Here’s what some other presidential contenders have said. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.): Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.): And, of course, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), perhaps the most vocal candidate on the issue: AHH: A judge issued a preliminary injunction that will allow Missouri’s last abortion clinic to remain open for at least another 10 days, saying the state's health department must decide by June 21 whether to grant the clinic's license renewal application. “The department has so far refused to do so, citing health concerns officials say they found during an annual inspection,” our Post colleague Reis Thebault reports. “But the preliminary injunction that Circuit Court Judge Michael Stelzer granted Planned Parenthood prevents its license from expiring until he makes another ruling.” “The ruling, Stelzer stressed, is not an opinion on whether the license should be approved or denied,” Reis adds. If the department decides not to renew the clinic’s license, it would become the only state in the country without a clinic that performs abortions. It would be the first time since 1974 that has been the case in the United States. “While this is welcome relief for patients and providers at Planned Parenthood, this fight is far from over,” Colleen McNicholas, a doctor at the clinic, said in a statement about the ruling. “Abortion access in Missouri is hanging on by a thread … We are too close to losing our rights and freedoms and we will not back down today, tomorrow, or ever.” OOF: More than 180 CEOs of companies such as Twitter, Atlantic Records and Warby Parker signed an open letter condemning stricter state antiabortion laws, charging that the restrictions threaten “the economic stability of their employees and customers, and makes it harder to build a diverse workforce and recruit talent,” our Post colleague Rachel Siegel reports. The letter appeared as a full-page ad in Monday’s New York Times. It marks the latest effort from leaders in the business community to put pressure on states that passed abortion restrictions. “Several industries have moved to exert pressure on states that limit access to abortion,” Rachel writes. “Some of the biggest names in Hollywood — including Walt Disney and WarnerMedia — have suggested that they might pull their business from Georgia if its new law survives a court challenge. Filmmaking is a $9.5 billion industry in Georgia that created more than 92,000 jobs last year, according to a McKinsey study.” As companies consider how to respond, Democrat and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has urged Hollywood leaders to keep businesses in the Georgia and to “#StayandFight” by financially supporting groups challenging the state’s new ban.  OUCH: Insys Therapeutics has filed for bankruptcy protection, just days after agreeing to a $225 million settlement over federal charges related to its sale of a highly addictive fentanyl spray. It’s the first time a pharmaceutical company has filed for Chapter 11 protection to help pay for expenses related to its role in the ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States, our Post colleague Taylor Telford reports. But other drugmakers could follow suit. Taylor reports OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is reportedly considering bankruptcy as it deals with lawsuits from numerous states over its role in the opioid crisis. The Arizona-based Insys settlement will end criminal and civil investigations into allegations the company was involved in a bribery scheme meant to get physicians to illegally prescribe the spray, Subsys, to patients who may not have needed the drug. The company “said it will continue operating while it considers selling its assets to cover the settlement. It will use its cash to stay afloat, including payment of employee wages and benefits, and will seek court approval to pay its suppliers and vendors in full.” — The Trump administration has proposed a change to a federal rule that has enabled older individuals with mental or physical disabilities who are also unable to communicate in English to qualify for benefits. But the Social Security Administration now says the inability to read, write or speak in English isn’t necessarily a major barrier, The Post’s Kimberly Kindy reports. “Members of Congress are squaring off over the proposal, with several Democrats saying the Trump administration is promoting an unnecessary and polarizing policy change that discriminates against older workers and is anti-immigrant,” she writes. “Some Republicans who favor the rule change say the current system is antiquated and does not take into account how multilingual U.S. citizens and residents have become.” The agency predicts if the proposed rule is finalized, there would be about 6,500 applicants a year who would no longer quality for benefits, which the administration expects will save $4.6 billion. “Altogether, 8.5 million people receive some form of federal disability insurance at an annual cost of about $133 billion, agency records show,” Kimberly writes. “Current projections show the program will have insufficient funds to pay all claims as soon as 2052.” — California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) reached an agreement over the weekend with the state’s Democratic-controlled legislature to include in his first budget funding to extend public health insurance to cover young adult undocumented immigrants, our Post colleague Scott Wilson reports. California will be the first state to make such a move. The budget agreement will allow for coverage for immigrants up to 25 years old who can sign up for Medi-Cal, the state health insurance plan for low-income people. In response to the deal, the California Immigrant Policy Center called the funding for expanded coverage “a clear step forward” but also said the “exclusion of undocumented elders from the same health care their U.S. citizen neighbors are eligible for means beloved community members will suffer and die from treatable conditions.”  “The expansion, which is expected to affect about 90,000 young adults, would begin Jan. 1 and is estimated to cost $98 million in its first year, a small fraction of the state’s roughly $213 billion budget,” Scott writes. “The full legislature must vote by June 15 on the budget deal, which is expected to pass easily.” — A hotel in the small town of Yale, Mich., is offering a free stay and transportation to women who come to the state to get an abortion. The manager of the Yale Hotel posted on Facebook offering her help to women who need to travel to Michigan amid new restrictions that have made it more difficult to obtain an abortion elsewhere, as our Post colleague Antonia Noori Farzan reports. “Dear sisters that live in Alabama, Ohio, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, or any of the other states that follow with similar laws restricting access,” Shelley O’Brien, 55, wrote in a Facebook post. “We cannot do anything about the way you are being treated in your home state. But, if you can make it to Michigan, we will support you with several nights lodging, and transportation to and from your appointment.” — A new nonpartisan group, Mental Health for US, wants the 2020 candidates to talk more about mental health and substance abuse. They’re launching a new effort to get presidential contenders and congressional candidates to share their stances on policy proposals that address mental health services and the addiction crisis, Stat’s Megan Thielking reports. The group, which launched yesterday, “aims to push candidates in both parties to be more vocal about their policy ideas to improve mental health care — particularly as the 2020 election increasingly centers on health care issues like expanding Medicare or lowering the price of prescription drugs,” Megan writes. “It’s the product of a collaboration between some of the nation’s most prominent mental health groups, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and the Jed Foundation.” Former Rhode Island congressman Patrick Kennedy (D), who co-chairs the new group, called it a “formative time in policymaking in our country … Having the advocacy community speak with one voice … that’s the best chance we have at making real progress.” — And here are a few more good reads:  Today Coming Up Did Bernie Sanders ‘consistently’ vote against the Hyde amendment?:	739	"[{""start"": 242, ""end"": 478, ""text"": ""Five years ago — as the country’s opioid crisis had just started garnering national attention — a study got a lot of buzz suggesting that opioid overdose deaths were 25 percent lower in states that had given the nod to medical marijuana"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1473, ""end"": 1692, ""text"": ""Thirty-three states plus the District of Columbia now allow the use of medical marijuana.

Using medical marijuana to help cure opioid addiction may seem counterintuitive. But a growing number of physicians and patient advocates say marijuana should be added to the list of traditional treatment options, pointing to studies that show it helps reduce opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. A bill being considered by lawmakers in Maryland would make it the fourth state to explicitly legalize the use of marijuana to treat opioid-abuse disorder, following Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. The effort is strongly opposed by many in the medical establishment, who say there is insufficient research to show that marijuana is an effective treatment and warn that about 10 percent of cannabis users become addicted to it. Supporters counter that large-scale research at the federal level is unlikely so long as marijuana remains a Schedule I drug, a classification for drugs deemed to have no medical value and a high potential for abuse. Some of the loudest voices in the discussion so far have been members of the medical marijuana industry, who could profit if the bill is passed, and those who work with the three anti-opioid treatments already approved by the federal government — methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone — who could lose clients if people turn to cannabis to treat withdrawal symptoms. The Maryland bill has not yet been scheduled for a committee vote. After similar legislation failed to advance last year, Maryland’s medical marijuana commission studied the issue, concluding there is “no credible scientific evidence” that marijuana can successfully treat opioid addiction, though it also found that states that have implemented medical cannabis laws saw reductions in opioid prescriptions for pain among Medicaid and Medicare enrollees and experienced fewer opioid overdose deaths. The commission did not offer a clear recommendation on whether lawmakers should approve the bill, which would add opioid-abuse disorder to the list of “qualifying medical conditions” that can be treated with medical cannabis. Opioid-related overdose deaths have soared in recent years in Maryland, with 1,185 in the state in the first half of 2018, the most recent data available. The vast majority of those deaths were related to fentanyl, a synthetic drug that can be 50 times stronger than heroin. Advocates say the increasing number of overdose deaths underscores the need for new solutions. “Yes, there needs to be more research,” said Gail Rand, a patient advocate and the chief financial officer for ForwardGro. “However, we believe there is enough research, especially considering the urgent need.” Patricia Frye, a physician in Takoma Park, said her patients who use marijuana and opioids to treat chronic pain need smaller doses of opioids than those who eschew cannabis. She said she has also observed decreases in anxiety and depression among users of medical marijuana. Frye said it should not be a deterrent that marijuana can be addictive because opioids are far more lethal. “They may be unproductive or sit on the couch, but [marijuana] won’t kill them,” she said. Studies show the addiction rate for marijuana is about 10 percent. Joseph Adams, a physician associated with the Maryland-D.C. Society of Addiction Medicine, testified against the legislation, saying it was part of a “desperate effort” to find alternatives to traditional methods for treating addiction, which he said are unfairly stigmatized. He is the medical director of a methadone program with several locations in Baltimore. Listing opioid-abuse disorder as a qualified medical condition could increase opioid-related overdose deaths, Adams said, because patients could stop using methadone or other proven treatments. Adams’s organization is part of a cohort of drug policy groups — which includes the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence — that oppose using marijuana to treat opioid addiction without more research. The states that have allowed marijuana to be used to treat opioid addiction have done so with a variety of restrictions. Regulations in Pennsylvania, for example, only permit physicians to prescribe medical cannabis if traditional treatments fail, or if cannabis is used in conjunction with traditional treatment options. Physicians in Maryland already can authorize marijuana for opioid addicts if their patients have “severe or chronic pain.” Supporters of the bill say explicitly including opioid-abuse disorder in the list of qualifying conditions is necessary for more doctors to begin seeing marijuana as a viable treatment option. “People are educated enough now to understand that medical cannabis can help with pain, but until it becomes brought to the public’s attention more, I don’t think it’s a go-to to deal with opioid-abuse disorder,” Rand said in an interview. “And it should be.” rachel.chason@washpost.com	738	"[{""start"": 81, ""end"": 300, ""text"": ""But a growing number of physicians and patient advocates say marijuana should be added to the list of traditional treatment options, pointing to studies that show it helps reduce opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 303, ""end"": 504, ""text"": ""bill being considered by lawmakers in Maryland would make it the fourth state to explicitly legalize the use of marijuana to treat opioid-abuse disorder, following Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2047, ""end"": 2321, ""text"": ""Opioid-related overdose deaths have soared in recent years in Maryland, with 1,185 in the state in the first half of 2018, the most recent data available.

Two studies published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine find that the availability of medical and recreational marijuana is linked to lower rates of opiate prescribing. In the first study, Hefei Wen of the University of Kentucky and Jason M. Hockenberry of Emory University found that the passage of medical and recreational marijuana laws were followed by reductions in Medicaid opiate prescription rates of 5.88 percent and 6.38 percent, respectively. “Marijuana liberalization may serve as a component of a comprehensive package to tackle the opioid epidemic,” Wen and Hockenberry concluded. In the second study, Ashley C. Bradford, W. David Bradford and Amanda Abraham of the University of Georgia found that at the state level, medical marijuana laws were associated with an 8.5 percent reduction in the number of daily opioid doses filled under Medicare Part D, relative to states without medical marijuana laws. Reductions were even higher (amounting to 14.4 percent) for states that allowed medical marijuana dispensaries. States that allowed home marijuana cultivation had 6.9 percent reductions in opiate prescriptions. “These findings further strengthen arguments in favor of considering medical applications of cannabis as one tool in the policy arsenal that can be used to diminish the harm of prescription opioids,” the authors concluded. The studies are the latest in a long line of research showing that marijuana availability is associated with reductions in opiate use and misuse. But the Wen and Hockenberry report is significant for finding a link between recreational marijuana and opiate use — most previous research has focused on medical marijuana. There is widespread agreement among doctors and public-health experts that marijuana is effective at treating chronic pain. Doctors often treat that condition with opiate medication, despite little evidence that opiates are effective for it. “Marijuana is one of the potential alternative drugs that can provide relief from pain at a relatively lower risk of addiction and virtually no risk of overdose,” Wen and Hockenberry wrote. “These findings suggest that medical and adult-use marijuana laws have the potential to reduce opioid prescribing for Medicaid enrollees, a segment of population with disproportionately high risk for chronic pain, opioid use disorder, and opioid overdose.” In a speech in New Hampshire last month outlining the administration's plan to deal with a nationwide opiate overdose crisis that claimed over 42,000 lives in 2016, President Trump called on researchers to “come up with a painkiller that’s not so addictive.” The latest studies suggest that such a painkiller already exists — it is called marijuana, and it is legal for medical use in 29 states and for recreational use in nine states plus the District. But the Trump administration has taken an adversarial stance toward states that have legalized marijuana in some fashion. The Justice Department rescinded an Obama-era policy of noninterference for state-legal marijuana operations, and the attorney general has expressed an interest in prosecuting medical marijuana providers. If the latest research is any indication, those actions might simply make the opioid epidemic even worse.	737	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 178, ""text"": ""tudies published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine find that the availability of medical and recreational marijuana is linked to lower rates of opiate prescribing"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 180, ""end"": 604, ""text"": ""n the first study, Hefei Wen of the University of Kentucky and Jason M.

The face of the nation’s opioid epidemic increasingly is gray and wrinkled. But that face often is overlooked in a crisis that frequently focuses on the young. Consider this: While opioid abuse declined in younger groups between 2002 and 2014, even sharply among those 18 to 25 years old, the epidemic almost doubled among Americans over age 50, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Because of information like that, the Senate Special Committee on Aging convened a hearing Wednesday on opioid misuse by the elderly. “Older Americans are among those unseen in this epidemic,” said Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.), the top Democrat on the panel. “In 2016, one in three people with a Medicare prescription drug plan received an opioid prescription. This puts baby boomers and our oldest generation at great risk.” Unwittingly, Medicare compounds the epidemic by funding needed opioids that can be abused, but, generally, not funding the care and medicines needed to fight opioid addiction. “Overall, one in three older Americans with Medicare drug coverage are prescribed opioid painkillers. However, while Medicare pays for opioid painkillers, Medicare does not pay for drug and alcohol treatment in most instances, nor does it pay for all of the medications that are used to help people in the treatment and recovery process,” William B. Stauffer, executive director of the Pennsylvania Recovery Organizations Alliance, in Harrisburg, Pa., said at the hearing. “Methadone, specifically, is a medication that is not covered by Medicare to treat opioid use conditions.” Offering scary statistics and practices involving older folks, Gary Cantrell, a deputy inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services, said “our nation is in the midst of an unprecedented opioid epidemic.” He focused on Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Part D is the prescription drug section of Medicare, the government health insurance program covering older people. About a half-million Part D recipients “received high amounts of opioids” in 2016, Cantrell said. Almost 20 percent of that group are at “serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose,” he warned, placing the high risk in two categories — those receiving “extreme amounts of opioids” and some “who appeared to be ‘doctor shopping.’ ” Doctor shoppers “each received high amounts of opioids and had four or more prescribers and four or more pharmacies for opioids,” Cantrell explained. “While some of these beneficiaries may not have been doctor shopping, receiving opioids from multiple prescribers and multiple pharmacies may still pose dangers from lack of coordinated care. Typically, beneficiaries who receive opioids have just one prescriber and one pharmacy.” Many elderly get hooked on opiates through prescriptions, rather than street drugs like heroin. “Older adults are at high risk for medication misuse due to conditions like pain, sleep disorders/insomnia, and anxiety that commonly occur in this population,” said Stauffer, who is in long-term recovery. “They are more likely to receive prescriptions for psychoactive medications with misuse potential, such as opioid analgesics for pain and central nervous system depressants like benzodiazepines for sleep disorders and anxiety. One study found that up to 11 percent of women older than age 60 misuse prescription medications. The combination of alcohol and medication misuse has been estimated to affect up to 19 percent of older Americans.” Sixty-one-year-old Denise Holden is in long-term recovery, too, but she became addicted as a young woman seeking a heroin high. She’s been in recovery for almost 25 years, after first using drugs when she was 19. She got clean, then relapsed, as is common, then got clean again. Staying that way, even after decades clean, is not easy. “I recently had back surgery,” the West Melbourne, Fla., resident said in an interview. “I had a spinal fusion and so I had been taking opiates for a period of time. You know, the older we get the more aches and pains we get. … We injure ourselves, we have surgeries. So, for people in recovery it’s a slippery slope because when you reintroduce that opiate to your system, your mind starts playing all kinds of tricks on you — ‘Oh you should take more, oh you should take less, oh you should throw them out. Oh no, take them all at once.’ It’s very difficult, like it’s a mind game. It is very challenging I would say, but it’s not impossible.” Holden urged seniors to take medicines only as prescribed, and if they have suffered drug abuse to “work a very strong program of recovery.” Addiction isn’t the only risk with opioids. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chairwoman of the committee, said, “Older adults taking opioids are also four to five times more likely to fall than those taking nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs.” That points to a vicious cycle. Taking opioids can lead to falls, falls can lead to pain, pain can lead to opioids and opioids can be abused. On top of that, doctors might not even realize the source of an elderly patient’s problem. “Regrettably,” Collins added, “health-care providers sometimes miss substance abuse among older adults, as the symptoms can be similar to depression or dementia.” Read more: [Trump’s opioid strategy ‘missing in action’ as 115 people die every day] [Is DEA a bad guy in opioid addiction fight?] [Veterans tell of medical marijuana use in defiance of backward federal policy] [The color of heroin addiction — why war then, treatment now?]	736	"[{""start"": 175, ""end"": 421, ""text"": ""While opioid abuse declined in younger groups between 2002 and 2014, even sharply among those 18 to 25 years old, the epidemic almost doubled among Americans over age 50, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 684, ""end"": 1025, ""text"": ""In 2016, one in three people with a Medicare prescription drug plan received an opioid prescription.

"Medical marijuana opponents recently pounced on a big new analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that there isn't good evidence that marijuana works for many of the conditions, like glaucoma, anxiety, or Parkinson's disease, that it's often prescribed for. The JAMA study was based on a meta-analysis of the findings of 79 previously-published studies. Now, the study did not say pot isn't helpful for people suffering from those ailments; it said there was no evidence to that effect, as German Lopez noted at Vox. Importantly, however, the JAMA study found solid evidence that marijuana is effective at treating one big condition: chronic pain. The JAMA review found ""30% or greater improvement in pain with cannabinoid compared with placebo,"" across the 79 studies it surveyed. A new NBER working paper out today is a helpful reminder of why that finding is so important. Pain management -- especially chronic pain management -- is a tricky business. Prescription painkillers are highly addictive and deadly -- they killed more than 16,000 people in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's's latest numbers. In the U.S., drug overdoses kill more people than suicide, guns or car crashes. The CDC now calls prescription painkiller abuse an ""epidemic."" The researchers on the NBER paper, however, found that access to state-sanctioned medical marijuana dispensaries is linked to a significant decrease in both prescription painkiller abuse, and in overdose deaths from prescription painkillers. The study authors examined admissions to substance abuse treatment programs for opiate addiction as well as opiate overdose deaths in states that do and do not have medical marijuana laws. They found that the presence of marijuana dispensaries was associated with a 15 to 35 percent decrease in substance abuse admissions. Opiate overdose deaths decreased by a similar amount. ""Our findings suggest that providing broader access to medical marijuana may have the potential benefit of reducing abuse of highly addictive painkillers,"" the researchers conclude. This paper builds on previous work showing that ""states with medical marijuana laws on the books saw 24.8 percent fewer deaths from painkiller overdoses compared to states that didn't have such laws."" But the new paper's findings are more robust -- it uses more data, and the authors drew on a broader range of statistical methods to test the validity of their data. Their most intriguing finding is that medical marijuana laws alone aren't enough to cause a significant shift in prescription painkiller use. Rather, the availability of medical marijuana through licensed dispensaries is the key: ""We find no impact of medical marijuana laws more broadly; the mitigating effect of medical marijuana laws is specific to states that permit dispensaries,"" they write. As with any study of this nature, this one has limitations. The numbers speak only to state-level trends, not to individual behavior. Some researchers, like Stanford University's Keith Humphreys, are skeptical of findings showing a negative link between medical pot and prescription painkiller abuse. ""The only way to determine if individuals in pain who use marijuana consume fewer opioid painkillers is by studying individuals directly,"" Humphreys said in an e-mail. ""The only study so far that did that found that opioid overdose risk factors are higher rather than lower in pain patients who access medical marijuana."" But the study Humphreys points to only examined people who had been prescribed opioids, says Mireille Jacobson, an associate professor of economics and health policy at UC Irvine and one of the co-authors of the NBER paper. ""If you're only looking at people who use opioids you're missing a completely other dimension -- people who are at risk of using opioids,"" she said in an interview. ""Some people who would have dealt with their pain through the use of opioids may now be opting to use medical marijuana"" in states allowing it. Policymakers tend to be focused on the potential negatives of marijuana liberalization -- teen use, addiction, etc. etc. But the potential benefits -- like reduced reliance on dangerous painkillers -- are overlooked. Jacobson says that given the magnitude of the prescription painkiller problem -- 16,000 deaths a year -- it's worth taking a serious look at the use of medical marijuana for chronic pain patients: ""If this is for real, it means that there are other ways that are less dangerous for people to deal with chronic pain."""	735	"[{""start"": 555, ""end"": 818, ""text"": ""mportantly, however, the JAMA study found solid evidence that marijuana is effective at treating one big condition: chronic pain.

UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA: Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. One-third of Americans who have taken prescription opioids for at least two months say they became addicted to, or physically dependent on, the powerful painkillers, according to a new Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Virtually all long-term users surveyed said that they were introduced to the drugs by a doctor’s prescription, not by friends or through illicit means. But more than 6 in 10 said doctors offered no advice on how or when to stop taking the drugs. And 1 in 5 said doctors provided insufficient information about the risk of side effects, including addiction. The survey raises sharp questions about the responsibility of doctors for an epidemic of addiction and overdose that has claimed nearly 180,000 lives since 2000. Opioid deaths surged to more than 30,000 last year, according to new data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with deaths from heroin alone surpassing the toll from gun homicides. Doctors have been widely blamed for sparking the crisis by overprescribing highly addictive opioids to treat everyday pain. The survey suggests that they are still doing too little to stop it. “Why isn’t it 100 percent?” demanded Gary Mendell, founder of Shatterproof, a grass-roots group dedicated to reducing addiction in the United States, referring to the share who say doctors have counseled them on stopping the medication. “It’s unbelievable that it’s not 100 percent.” Patrice A. Harris, chairwoman of the American Medical Association’s Board of Trustees and chair of its task force to reduce opioid abuse, acknowledged that doctors could do more to counsel patients on avoiding addiction. “The doctors that I have talked to are discussing this with their patients,” Harris said. But, citing the survey, she added: “We could certainly do a better job.” Despite the high rate of dependence, the poll finds that a majority of long-term opioid users say the drugs have dramatically improved their lives. Opioids relieve pain that is otherwise in­trac­table, they said in follow-up interviews, allowing them to walk, work and pursue other activities. Fully two-thirds of users surveyed said relief is well worth the risk of addiction. People living with opioid users tend to have a darker view of the drugs’ effects. While one-third of users say they are hooked, more than half of people living with them suspect addiction, the survey found. Family members are also far more likely to say the drugs have damaged the users’ physical and mental health, finances and personal relationships. Still, the survey’s findings highlight a fundamental conflict: While the drugs are a scourge for many, they are a godsend to others, especially the estimated 100 million Americans who live in chronic pain. Efforts by policymakers to restrict use have been met with outrage. “We’re not saying that no one should ever be on these pills,” but most people would be “healthier and more functional if they were off them,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, who this spring urged doctors to sharply limit the number of pills they prescribe. “The bottom line here is that prescription opiates are as addictive as heroin. They’re dangerous drugs,” Frieden said. “You take a few pills, you can be addicted for life. You take a few too many and you can die.” Opioid abuse — both prescription painkillers and their chemical cousins, heroin and fentanyl — is the main cause of rising death rates among middle-aged white Americans, particularly women in rural areas. It also has contributed to the first overall decline in U.S. life expectancy at birth in more than two decades, the government reported Thursday. In 2014, U.S. doctors wrote 240 million prescriptions for opiates, enough for every adult to have their own bottle of pills. The CDC estimated that about 2.1 million Americans are addicted to legal narcotics. In the first-ever guidelines on opioids for physicians, the CDC in March urged doctors to try nonnarcotic methods before offering patients pills containing oxycodone, hydrocodone and other opioids. The guidelines noted that there is little evidence that opioids are effective beyond 12 weeks. “Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed,” the guidelines say. But many people take the drugs much longer. In the past two years, about 5 percent of American adults have used prescription opioids for at least two months, the poll found; about half of those report taking the drugs for two years or more. For the survey, one of the most comprehensive polls of long-term opioid users to date, The Post and Kaiser interviewed 622 people who said that they had taken narcotic painkillers for at least two months over the past two years. The survey also included 187 people who said they share a household with an opioid user, usually a spouse or a parent. The survey did not include people who were treated for cancer or a terminal illness. At the time of the interview, 45 percent of long-term users were no longer taking the drugs, while 55 percent were still taking them. Users were slightly more likely than the general public to be white and far more apt to be middle-aged. Nearly all long-term users (95 percent) said that they began taking the drugs to relieve pain from surgery, an injury or a chronic condition. Just 3 percent said that they started as recreational users. More than 8 in 10 said that they tried to manage their pain with nonnarcotic medication; about 7 in 10 said that they tried alternative treatments, such as physical therapy and acupuncture. More than half (57 percent) found those methods ineffective. Charles Stonesifer, 74, a former bricklayer who lives in Baltimore, has taken Tylenol with codeine and then Tramadol over the past two years. “Both my knees are shot,” he said, adding that he would be unable to walk without narcotics. Stonesifer said that he had no trouble giving up the drugs when he tried, but his pain returned and he was forced to resume taking them. “If they actually stopped you from getting the [drugs], it would be very difficult for me,” Stonesifer said. “It would put me in a wheelchair instead of being able to get around. And once you’re in a wheelchair, you never get up.” Nancy Horton, 62, of Martinsburg, W.Va., admits that she is addicted to the 190 milligrams of oxycodone she takes daily to dull the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Without the drugs, “I get the shakes. I am very anxious,” she said. “I just pace constantly. I can’t get comfortable.” After 15 years on opioids, she said, “I look back now and think, ‘What could I have done differently?’ ” Sizable minorities of respondents report using the drugs for purposes other than managing pain. Such behavior is much more common among people who say they are addicted or physically dependent on opioids. Among this group, 47 percent say they sometimes take the drugs for “fun or to get high”; 38 percent use them to “deal with day-to-day stress”; and 30 percent use them to “relax or relieve tension.” Side effects are widespread. Over half of long-term users said that they have experienced constipation; almost as many felt indigestion, dry mouth or nausea; and 15 percent said that they have had breathing problems. One in 5 (21 percent) have taken additional medications to treat those symptoms. More than half (52 percent) of long-term users said that they have taken other prescription medications for anxiety, depression and sleeplessness while on opioids, and 1 in 6 said that they have consumed the drugs along with alcohol — risky combinations that could have dire consequences. Overall, nearly 6 in 10 said that they take at least four prescription drugs, and about one-third said that they take seven or more medications. The survey revealed a largely positive relationship between opioid consumers and their doctors. Large majorities said doctors have warned them to avoid alcohol, cautioned them about possible side effects and explained the risk of addiction. But 61 percent said that their doctors did not suggest a plan for getting off the drugs when they were first prescribed, and more than half said doctors have not altered their dose or frequency. Among long-term users who stopped taking opioids, 34 percent said the termination of their prescription was a reason. Just 4 percent said that they have a prescription for naloxone, the drug that can be administered by someone else in an emergency to reverse the effect of an overdose. While about a quarter of long-term users said a friend or family member has suggested they stop taking the drug, two-thirds said that they are “not too” or “not at all” concerned about becoming addicted. And about 6 in 10 of those who report being addicted have not sought treatment or other help. Yngvild Olsen, chair of the American Society of Addiction Medicine’s public policy committee, said doctors “have a vital role to play in addressing the epidemic, not only by changing their prescribing patterns and learning a lot more about chronic pain management and addiction, but also by stepping up to the plate in learning how to treat addiction.” Emily Guskin, Monica Akhtar and Erin Patrick O’Connor contributed to this report.	734	"[{""start"": 57, ""end"": 474, ""text"": ""Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women.

Editor’s note: This report is part of the project titled “America’s Weed Rush,” produced by the Carnegie-Knight News21 initiative, a national investigative reporting project involving top college journalism students across the country and headquartered at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University. PITTSBURGH — In Room 716 of the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, 12-year-old Hannah Pallas is motionless but for an occasional turn of her head and the blink of her eyes, having suffered life-threatening seizures. On the same day, 5-year-old Sydney Michaels is down the hall in Room 749, waiting to be discharged after 15 grand mal seizures within 36 hours. Their mothers have known each other for years, though it’s a hapless coincidence caused by their daughters’ epilepsy that brings them to the pediatric unit on the same day. The two women are part of a tenacious group of parents and national marijuana advocates demanding that politicians and state legislators legalize medical marijuana treatment for their children, whose medications have had limited success treating seizures and other severe conditions. “This is something that needs to happen across the country so that every child who might need this would have access,” said Julie Michaels, Sydney’s mother and a member of Campaign for Compassion, which is pushing for comprehensive medical marijuana laws in Pennsylvania. “Why should the state lines be the factor as to whether my child can get help or not?” Sydney is one of only a few hundred children in the country enrolled in a clinical trial to test the use of marijuana-based treatments for epilepsy. But Hannah is not. “I’m watching my daughter die every day,” said Heather Shuker, Hannah’s mother. “Hannah has so many seizures, and every seizure could take her from me. I firmly believe that medical cannabis will help her.” “There’s so much that I want for her right now that she just can’t do,” Michaels said about Sydney. “Just being able to go out and experience life, to be able to go out and play in the yard without fear of seizures starting.” Since 2014, 17 states have legalized the use of marijuana-derived cannabidiol (CBD) for children: Utah, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia. The laws are intended mostly to treat intractable epilepsy and, in some cases, other conditions. Florida, Georgia and Louisiana, for example, allow limited medical marijuana use for cancer treatment. CBD is the non-psychoactive component of the marijuana plant. It has yet to be proven scientifically as a successful treatment, though anecdotal evidence suggests it helps some children. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the part of the plant that produces a high, but it is also known — if not proven — to treat pain, nausea and insomnia, among other symptoms. The 17 states that recently passed CBD legislation all placed limits on the THC concentration of medical marijuana extracts to minimize the psychoactive effects of the medication. They range from 0.3 percent in Oklahoma to 5 percent in Georgia. Shuker said Hannah, diagnosed with severe intractable epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, has about 250 seizures a month. They have tried more than 18 seizure medications and special diets. Pharmaceuticals made her daughter’s seizures worse, Shuker said. Hannah now has a surgical feeding tube because she can no longer swallow on her own. Doctors have told Shuker that Hannah’s only remaining option to try to reduce the seizures is a brain surgery procedure, with risks of infection, increased seizures or stroke. Meanwhile, visits to the emergency room and pediatric ward have become routine. Shuker and Michaels say their lives revolve around doctor appointments and unexpected stays in the hospital. While other mothers track their children’s height on walls with markers, these mothers track dates and times and the numbers of seizures on homemade charts. Sydney is one of 25 children participating in the clinical trial at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who are receiving doses of Epidiolex, a purified CBD created by London-based GW Pharmaceuticals. Part of the drug’s attraction is that it is low in THC. “Prior to this study, she couldn’t do a puzzle. After about two weeks, she was whipping through puzzles on an iPad and we’re like, ‘Who is this kid?’” Michaels said. “We’re talking about a kid who was seizing easily from 1,000 to 3,000 times in a week. It was incredible.” Eric Marsh, assistant professor of neurology and pediatrics at Children’s Hospital and attending physician for the Philadelphia clinical trial, was cautiously optimistic about the overall results, with parents reporting a 50 percent to 60 percent reduction in their children’s seizures. However, Marsh encourages families to wait until marijuana-derived medications earn Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. “There’s so much interest and excitement over this that it really could skew results,” Marsh said. “It does seem that CBD interacts with some of the other medications. Clearly it’s not a miracle drug. It has interactions with other drugs, and it does have side effects.” For many parents, the 2013 airing of the CNN documentary “Weed” was the watershed moment that ignited a movement to make cannabis oil available to children. The report featured Charlotte Figi, a then-5-year-old girl from Colorado Springs who used cannabis oil to treat the 300 grand mal seizures she suffered each week. The oil she uses, Charlotte’s Web, is named after her and produced by Colorado-based Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises. “We tried this on her, and it stopped her seizures,” said Paige Figi, Charlotte’s mother. “Now, three and a half years later, she has two seizures a month — down from 1,200.” “They’ve responded very well. Obviously, it’s not a silver bullet for everyone,” said Jesse Stanley, who grows and produces the oils with his brothers. Their nonprofit, the Realm of Caring, offers oils to patients at reduced prices. Many other parents, inspired by Charlotte’s story and frustrated with unsupportive politicians, have since moved from their home states to Colorado, where marijuana treatments are legal. According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, 434 children are on the state’s medical marijuana registry. In August 2013, there were 60. “The first ‘Weed’ presentation was in August of 2013, and so we started getting a lot of phone calls starting in September and October, and started seeing patients in November and December,” said Kevin Chapman, a neurologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. Chapman sees many of the children using cannabis oil to treat their seizures, including those whose families moved to Colorado in the past two years. He authored a report last year that measured the effectiveness of using cannabis extracts to reduce seizures. He and other doctors surveyed the parents of 75 children in Colorado and reported that 33 percent of parents said they saw their children’s seizures reduce by more than 50 percent. The Denver neurologist understands the limitations of his study, starting with the sample size of 75 children — all of whom used different oils, each with its own chemical makeup. Making matters more complicated, the participants had different types of epilepsy that varied in severity. The study also depended on parental reporting, which Chapman says can produce biases. The report said the study results highlighted “the need for controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral cannabis extracts for treatment of pediatric epilepsies.” “Families picked up and moved to Colorado with the hopes that it’s going to make their child better,” Chapman said. “All of us in that situation would hope that it really works, and, therefore, we think that there might be some bias that could skew the numbers to suggest that it’s a bit more effective.” Larry Wolk, chief medical officer and director of the Colorado health department, said that he could not ignore the anecdotal success stories reported by parents but that more research needs to be done. “You only hear about the children it helps. The problem is that it doesn’t help everyone. The results are mixed,” Wolk said. “As a physician, I’m worried that we’re rushing this.” Despite the lack of scientific evidence, families have become medical refugees — leaving their homes to chase the uncertain prospect that medical cannabis may save their children’s lives. Many believe medical cannabis is their last option. Earlier this year, 9-year-old Alexis Bortell of Dallas had one of her worst seizures and was taken to a hospital. For moments at a time, she stopped breathing. A week later, she suffered strokelike symptoms, said her father, Dean Bortell. Anti-seizure pharmaceutical drugs such as Depakote and Carbatrol did little to stop her seizures and seemed to incite a range of side effects such as anger. “We had to put all the knives in the house up out of her reach,” her father said. “She was just not herself,” he said, adding that that is when his wife, Liza and he “decided it’s time to go.” They moved to Colorado earlier this year. Today, Alexis wakes up early every morning to take her dose of CBD oil with a drop of THC in her new home in Littleton. She swallows the oil through a syringe twice a day. “I would describe it like an earthy taste,” Alexis said. What follows is a very active schedule: playing with Purdy the service cat, Skyping with friends in Texas, shooting hoops, golfing practice, playing at the park, swimming and ending the day eating frozen yogurt at Yogurtini. “It has changed my daughter’s life in the most positive way humanly possible,” Bortell said, adding that she hasn’t had a seizure in 100 days. “We’ve got our little girl back.” Thirteen-year-old Austin Hilterbran also is a medical refugee, having moved with his family from his home in Choctaw, Okla., to Colorado just last year. Two years ago, he was on life support seven times because the drugs he took for Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy, damaged his internal organs, his mother said. “You are leaving your home for something you don’t even know is going to work,” Amy Hilterbran, his mother, said. Austin started taking CBD oil with THC, a combination his mother calls “Austin’s Answer.” Hilterbran said that his seizures are down by 90 percent and that she has weaned him off 70 percent of his pharmaceutical drugs. He walks on his own, something he has rarely done. “He gets to be a little boy,” she said. “He’s able to communicate because he’s not in a pharmaceutical fog.” Despite the legislation passed in 17 states, obtaining CBD is not as simple as buying the oil off a dispensary shelf. States such as Alabama and Tennessee only dispense oils through clinical trials at universities. Florida and Texas allow for the production and distribution of oils to qualified patients in the state, but their programs are not yet operational. States such as Iowa and Virginia don’t define methods of access in their laws. Parents also say that the list of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana treatment should be extended to include conditions such as cancer and bowel diseases. But perhaps the most contested component of the laws is the THC limits. In Colorado, the Bortells and Hilterbrans add droplets of concentrated THC into their children’s cannabis oil treatments — something that would be illegal in their home states of Texas and Oklahoma. “It’s vital for people to know that she is not just taking CBD oil. She is taking CBD oil mixed with THC,” Dean Bortell said. Bortell believes that adding THC to his daughter’s medicine will increase the effectiveness of seizure control. The benefits of combining THC and CBD, a concept known as the “entourage effect,” was first researched and documented by Raphael Mechoulam, an Israeli scientist, who concluded that the 400-plus chemical components of marijuana work better together than in isolation. The FDA, which monitors most clinical trials, has not approved any marijuana-related treatment. Its Web site warns parents of using these untested treatments. “We understand that parents are trying to find treatments for their children’s medical conditions. However, the use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences,” the FDA statement says. “Caregivers and patients can be confident that FDA-approved drugs have been carefully evaluated for safety, efficacy, and quality, and are monitored by the FDA once they are on the market.” Steve Schultz, a vice-president at GW Pharmaceuticals, said the FDA has authorized 450 children across the country to participate in the clinical trials with Epidiolex. “We don’t argue with the fact that these parents want to help their children,” Schultz said. “But it takes time and money. It’s an onerous process in place for the protection of the consumer and the patient.” While early observations from Epidiolex clinical trials are promising, it’s uncertain whether and when the drug will be readily available. The Cannamoms, a group of mothers from Florida advocating medical marijuana, made a trip to California last year to see whether cannabis oil would work on their children. Florida’s program, legalized in 2014, is not yet operational. Jacel Delgadillo of Miami said she was seeking alternatives to medications her 4-year-old son has taken since he was seven months old to treat intractable epilepsy. “I actually had one day with no seizures. That’s very unheard of in Bruno’s case,” Delgadillo said of her visit to California. “All he was taking was the cannabis oil.” Until the oils are available in Florida, Bruno is back on powerful anti-epileptic medications. His latest drug is potassium bromide — a drug used on dogs that is not approved by the FDA. “Today there is nothing available, but if we wanted to prescribe another drug that is more harmful to him, it would be available right away,” Delgadillo said. The new law allows no more than 0.8 percent THC to be used in the oils. “Here in Florida, when that bill is up and running, the higher THC won’t be available, even though some patients would definitely benefit from it,” Delgadillo said. Not all Florida parents are as enthusiastic about using THC on their children. “From a children with epilepsy standpoint, I don’t know if I am interested in THC products, personally for my daughter. There are studies that show that high THC is not good for the developing brain,” said mother Holley Moseley, whose 12-year-old daughter RayAnn suffers from epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Holley Moseley and her husband, Peyton Moseley, are among the many parents who fought for cannabis. They hired two lobbyists to help send a bill through the state legislature. Several days before Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed the bill, their daughter was invited to his office, where he promised the bill would go through. “It was pretty special,” Holley Moseley said, “to know that this little person is changing Florida law.”	733	"[{""start"": 2126, ""end"": 2398, ""text"": ""Since 2014, 17 states have legalized the use of marijuana-derived cannabidiol (CBD) for children: Utah, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6134, ""end"": 6320, ""text"": ""Many other parents, inspired by Charlotte’s story and frustrated with unsupportive politicians, have since moved from their home states to Colorado, where marijuana treatments are legal."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 12124, ""end"": 12281, ""text"": ""The FDA, which monitors most clinical trials, has not approved any marijuana-related treatment.

"There's a body of research showing that painkiller abuse and overdose are lower in states with medical marijuana laws. These studies have generally assumed that when medical marijuana is available, pain patients are increasingly choosing pot over powerful and deadly prescription narcotics. But that's always been just an assumption. Now a new study, released in the journal Health Affairs, validates these findings by providing clear evidence of a missing link in the causal chain running from medical marijuana to falling overdoses. Ashley and W. David Bradford, a daughter-father pair of researchers at the University of Georgia, scoured the database of all prescription drugs paid for under Medicare Part D from 2010 to 2013. They found that, in the 17 states with a medical-marijuana law in place by 2013, prescriptions for painkillers and other classes of drugs fell sharply compared with states that did not have a medical-marijuana law. The drops were quite significant: In medical-marijuana states, the average doctor prescribed 265 fewer doses of antidepressants each year, 486 fewer doses of seizure medication, 541 fewer anti-nausea doses and 562 fewer doses of anti-anxiety medication. But most strikingly, the typical physician in a medical-marijuana state prescribed 1,826 fewer doses of painkillers in a given year.   These conditions are among those for which medical marijuana is most often approved under state laws. So as a sanity check, the Bradfords ran a similar analysis on drug categories that pot typically is not recommended for — blood thinners, anti-viral drugs and antibiotics. And on those drugs, they found no changes in prescribing patterns after the passage of marijuana laws. ""This provides strong evidence that the observed shifts in prescribing patterns were in fact due to the passage of the medical marijuana laws,"" they write. In a news release, lead author Ashley Bradford wrote, ""The results suggest people are really using marijuana as medicine and not just using it for recreational purposes."" One interesting wrinkle in the data is glaucoma, for which there was a small increase in demand for traditional drugs in medical-marijuana states. It's routinely listed as an approved condition under medical-marijuana laws, and studies have shown that marijuana provides some degree of temporary relief for its symptoms. The Bradfords hypothesize that the short duration of the glaucoma relief provided by marijuana — roughly an hour or so — may actually stimulate more demand in traditional glaucoma medications. Glaucoma patients may experience some short-term relief from marijuana, which may prompt them to seek other, robust treatment options from their doctors. The tanking numbers for painkiller prescriptions in medical marijuana states are likely to cause some concern among pharmaceutical companies. These companies have long been at the forefront of opposition to marijuana reform, funding research by anti-pot academics and funneling dollars to groups, such as the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, that oppose marijuana legalization. Pharmaceutical companies have also lobbied federal agencies directly to prevent the liberalization of marijuana laws. In one case, recently uncovered by the office of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), the Department of Health and Human Services recommended that naturally derived THC, the main psychoactive component of marijuana, be moved from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act — a less restrictive category that would acknowledge the drug's medical use and make it easier to research and prescribe. Several months after HHS submitted its recommendation, at least one drug company that manufactures a synthetic version of THC — which would presumably have to compete with any natural derivatives — wrote to the Drug Enforcement Administration to express opposition to rescheduling natural THC, citing ""the abuse potential in terms of the need to grow and cultivate substantial crops of marijuana in the United States."" The DEA ultimately rejected the HHS recommendation without explanation. In what may be the most concerning finding for the pharmaceutical industry, the Bradfords took their analysis a step further by estimating the cost savings to Medicare from the decreased prescribing. They found that about $165 million was saved in the 17 medical marijuana states in 2013. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, the estimated annual Medicare prescription savings would be nearly half a billion dollars if all 50 states were to implement similar programs. ""That amount would have represented just under 0.5 percent of all Medicare Part D spending in 2013,"" they calculate. Cost-savings alone are not a sufficient justification for implementing a medical-marijuana program. The bottom line is better health, and the Bradfords' research shows promising evidence that medical-marijuana users are finding plant-based relief for conditions that otherwise would have required a pill to treat. ""Our findings and existing clinical literature imply that patients respond to medical marijuana legislation as if there are clinical benefits to the drug, which adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the Schedule 1 status of marijuana is outdated,"" the study concludes. One limitation of the study is that it only looks at Medicare Part D spending, which applies only to seniors. Previous studies have shown that seniors are among the most reluctant medical-marijuana users, so the net effect of medical marijuana for all prescription patients may be even greater. The Bradfords will next look at whether similar patterns hold for Medicaid."	732	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 117, ""text"": ""s a body of research showing that painkiller abuse and overdose are lower in states with medical marijuana laws"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 119, ""end"": 289, ""text"": ""These studies have generally assumed that when medical marijuana is available, pain patients are increasingly choosing pot over powerful and deadly prescription narcotics"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 334, ""end"": 533, ""text"": ""Now a new study, released in the journal Health Affairs, validates these findings by providing clear evidence of a missing link in the causal chain running from medical marijuana to falling overdoses"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 730, ""end"": 943, ""text"": ""hey found that, in the 17 states with a medical-marijuana law in place by 2013, prescriptions for painkillers and other classes of drugs fell sharply compared with states that did not have a medical-marijuana law"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 945, ""end"": 1435, ""text"": ""he drops were quite significant: In medical-marijuana states, the average doctor prescribed 265 fewer doses of antidepressants each year, 486 fewer doses of seizure medication, 541 fewer anti-nausea doses and 562 fewer doses of anti-anxiety medication.

"Speaking this morning before the National Association of Attorneys General, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressed doubt that marijuana could help mitigate the opioid abuse epidemic. “I see a line in The Washington Post today [link added] that I remember from the '80s,” Sessions said. ""'Marijuana is a cure for opiate abuse.' Give me a break. This is the kind of argument that's been made out there to just — almost a desperate attempt to defend the harmlessness of marijuana or even its benefits. I doubt that's true. Maybe science will prove I'm wrong.” The stakes are pretty high here. After all, opioids killed 33,000 people in 2015, up from around 8,000 in 1999. As the head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Sessions oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration, which just last year reaffirmed its belief that marijuana has no medical value and hence should remain illegal (which makes it substantially more difficult for researchers to conduct studies). Here's a run-down of where the evidence on marijuana and opiates stands. Marijuana is great at treating chronic pain. This is the big finding, and the one from which all the others spring. Surveying the entire known universe of studies about the medical efficacies of cannabis, the National Academies of Science, Medicine and Engineering found “strong evidence” showing marijuana is effective at dealing with chronic pain in adults, relative to a placebo. The National Academies study is the most thorough review of the literature on marijuana to date, conducted by some of the nation's leading substance use researchers. Across numerous trials and experiments, the report found, people treated for pain with marijuana were “more likely to experience a significant reduction in pain symptoms” compared to a placebo or doing nothing at all. This is huge news, considering the annual opiate overdose numbers cited above. Americans consume roughly 80 percent of the world's opiate painkiller supply. The drugs are often prescribed for long-term treatment of chronic pain, a practice that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now trying to discourage. Prescription painkillers and other opioids are highly addictive, and taking too much of them can easily kill you. Marijuana is habit-forming too, but not nearly as much as opiate drugs like heroin. It also has no known lethal dose — you basically can't consume large enough quantities of marijuana at a fast enough pace for overdose death to become a concern the way it is with say, OxyContin or fentanyl — or alcohol for that matter. There’s been a lot of research done into this question in recent years. Here’s what it says: States with medical marijuana laws see fewer opiate deaths. According to a 2014 study in JAMA Internal Medicine, states with medical marijuana laws between 1999 and 2010 saw, on average, about 25 percent fewer opiate overdose deaths than states without such laws. What's more, the effect of a medical marijuana law appeared to grow over time — more lives were saved each additional year after the laws' implementation, suggesting an effect from more people taking advantage of the programs. This, of course, is just an observational study. It looks at the correlation between medical marijuana uptake and opiate deaths, but it isn't able to say that the former definitively caused the decline in the latter. But these findings were soon borne out by other research. Access to medical marijuana dispensaries is associated with less prescription painkiller abuse, and fewer overdose deaths. A 2015 working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the presence of medical marijuana dispensaries in a state was linked to a 15 to 35 percent decrease in admissions to substance abuse treatment centers, along with a similar decline in overdose deaths. This study was somewhat more rigorous than the previous paper, drawing on a larger data set that stood up to greater statistical scrutiny. As one of the authors told me at the time, “If this is for real, it means that there are other ways that are less dangerous [than prescription painkillers] for people to deal with chronic pain.” Medical marijuana is associated with fewer opiate-induced car crashes. A 2016 Columbia University paper zeroed in on a different facet of the substance abuse problem — auto accidents. The researchers found that after a state passes a medical marijuana law, fewer drivers in those states test positive for opioids after fatal car crashes. The take-home here is pretty simple: “in states with medical marijuana laws, fewer individuals are using opioids,” the authors conclude. Painkiller prescriptions fall sharply after medical marijuana laws are introduced. A novel study conducted last year looked at what happened to Medicare Part D painkiller prescriptions after states passed medical marijuana laws. It found that the typical physician in a medical marijuana state prescribed 1,826 fewer painkiller doses for Medicare patients in a given year. Why? Some seniors don't need painkillers if they have access to medical pot (related: seniors and people in late middle age are among the fastest growing marijuana use demographics). Among chronic pain patients, marijuana use is associated with less opiate use. A study published last year in the Journal of Pain found chronic pain patients who reported marijuana use were 64 percent less likely to report opiate use, more likely to report good quality of life, and less likely to report negative side effects from their medication. “This study suggests that many chronic pain patients are essentially substituting medical cannabis for opioids and other medications for chronic pain treatment, and finding the benefit and side effect profile of cannabis to be greater than these other classes of medications,” the authors conclude. “More research is needed to validate this finding.” * * * “More research is needed.” Researchers universally say they need to do more studies to tease out the nature of the relationships seen in the studies above. In particular, what's sorely lacking are controlled experiments that allow doctors to treat either chronic pain or opiate dependency with medical marijuana. But as of right now that research is incredibly difficult to do because of how marijuana is classified by the federal government. As a Schedule 1 controlled substance, the government has deemed that marijuana has “no medically accepted use.” Researchers can still work with it, but it requires jumping through an onerous system of legal hoops that can sometimes take years to navigate. It took nearly a decade for one researcher trying to use marijuana to treat PTSD in military veterans to obtain all the approvals necessary. Those roadblocks have a chilling effect on marijuana research, as outlined in a 2015 Brookings Institution report. Meanwhile, while researchers fight red tape, tens of thousands of opiate users are dying.

Gregorian chant filled my ears as I looked out the floor-to-ceiling window of the town gym. The morning sunlight hit the yoga studio’s floor in beams, shadows dancing as cardinals hopped from branch to branch on the trees outside, everything connected, just as it should be during yoga. I had been practicing for about three months and thought I was ready to take my stretches to the next level. I was wrong. There was no telltale crunch or sharp pain as I lay on my back, tossed my legs over my head and forced them to touch the ground behind me. I knew I was hurt only when the slight stiffness in my neck hadn’t disappeared by the next day. By the next week, I couldn’t fully turn my head, and by the next month, my right arm started going numb. I took myself to the doctor. That was June 2014, and I didn’t know it then, but I would eventually find myself in chronic pain, on a journey that would one day have me brushing up against growing concerns about prescription painkillers. As I would discover, the medical community and government officials have been hashing out new guidelines about opioid prescriptions as overdose deaths have surged. Many people with chronic pain say opioids are the only drugs that provide any relief, but with 259 million prescriptions being written a year — that was the number for 2012 — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing recommendations that would urge providers to limit doses of painkillers and to find other treatments, including physical therapy and different drugs for injured patients. My yoga mishap left me with a herniated, or slipped, disk in my spine. The softer center of the disk was protruding through the hard exterior, pinching a nerve. At the time, treatment was simple: physical therapy and a two-week course of steroids for inflammation. Surgery, the doctors said, was a last resort. It took months, but by the fall I was on my way to recovery. Then I reinjured myself, this time during an abdominal workout. Back came the numbness, the headaches, the constant throb at my neck, shooting up toward my eyes and down my spine. I visited the same urgent-care clinic I’d been to the first time around. They prescribed me a week of steroids and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and they gave me what I’d gone there for — a referral to physical therapy. But this time, when I went through my discharge paperwork at home, I noticed a memo that seemed to have been placed there by accident as it couldn’t have been talking about me. Across the top, in big bold letters, it read: “Pain Management, Chronic.” Underneath, the memo started with “You have a painful condition that has required frequent use of narcotic-type pain medicine.” It went on to recommend that I see my primary-care physician, and it told me to expect to sign a pain contract there, explaining that a pain contract is “a letter from your doctor which describes what pain medicine you may receive, how much and how often.” Once I’d acquired this contract, I was to bring it with me every time I returned to the clinic. This is all well and good, except that I’ve never been prescribed narcotics, opioids or any other addictive medication for my neck. As far as I could tell (the clinic declined to comment for this article), I received the documentation based only on the fact that this persistent pain in the neck has been bothering me for a year now, pushing it from acute to chronic. The United States uses 80 percent of the world’s opioids, according to a 2010 article in Pain Physician Journal, yet it makes up less than 5 percent of the world’s population. And 28,647 people — a record number — died from prescription opioids and heroin overdoses in 2014, according to the CDC. Emergency rooms, clinics and doctors have come under scrutiny in recent years as painkiller addiction has increased along with the death rate. A recent Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health report found fault with the entire supply system of pain medication, asserting that doctors too often prescribed painkillers in excessive amounts and for conditions that did not warrant them. Last year, the Drug Enforcement Agency tightened up rules on dispensing some painkillers, and the CDC is expected to announce new guidelines soon about how doctors should prescribe painkillers. Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, says that clinics and doctors are playing it safe by making broad use of contracts such as the one I received. “Clinics need to cover their backs,” he told me. “They assume because you’re in a chronic-pain category, they should give you the memos. That way, in case they get audited, they can show their paper trail and prove that they’ve done due diligence.” Doctors do not want to send patients away in pain, Wergin said, but they also do not want to harm patients or get in trouble by overprescribing pain medication. The Hopkins report suggested more-stringent guidelines for prescribing opioids, calling on states to overhaul the way they monitor chronic pain treatment and adopt procedures — such as urine screening and collecting data on prescriptions given to patients — to make it easier to identify who may need treatment for substance abuse. Doctors are divided. Lynn Webster, a former president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine and the author of “The Painful Truth: What Pain Is Really Like and Why It Matters to Each of Us,” criticized the Hopkins report. “I am amazed that one of our finest educational institutions in America failed to address the most important source of the prescription drug abuse problem in their report,” he said. “Not once did the report discuss the lack of safe and effective treatments for pain. The report lacks attention to the needs of people in pain.” Caleb Alexander, lead author of the report, said that while he agrees that new and more effective pain treatments are necessary, the point of the report was to suggest ways to make current treatments safer. “The goal was to make recommendations to reduce an incredibly high rate of injury and death associated with opioids,” Alexander said. “My concern with focusing on safer treatments is that it distracts from the epidemic of prescription opioids.” Many doctors agree that new federal guidelines — including a full physical exam and medical history on each pain patient, starting patients on the lowest effective dose, implementing pain contracts and closely monitoring pain medication use — are necessary. Growing awareness of the problem and discussion about the soon-to-be-released CDC guidelines are already resulting in better interactions, Wergin said. “Before, we were trying to treat pain in a less structured environment, and it was harder to see the full picture,” he said. Now states are keeping more detailed records and centralizing them “so the patient’s entire care management team has easy access to what exactly is going on at any given time.” Without pain contracts and without knowing a person’s history, clinics could accidentally prescribe a patient too much pain medication. However, pain contracts are being administered broadly, even to patients — like me — who have never taken opioids. Some critics say that can damage the doctor-patient relationship. “With chronic pain, you have to have that trust and relationship, to help people feel like people. Sometimes we can be labeled as prescription writers,” Wergin said. Urgent-care clinics “have it harder than I do because they don’t know their patients. They’re doing the best they can, and they want the patient to be satisfied with their service, and so they want the pain gone for the patient.” While some parts of the notice I received didn’t apply to me specifically, Wergin said, the rest of the advice was sound. “Pain patients should have a primary-care doctor,” he said. “The outcomes will be better. They’ll get to know their doctor over time, and the doctor will come to know them as well. There’s a level of trust there.” But Webster said the guidelines are doing nothing to promote best practice. “Guidelines are superficial,” he told me. “They don’t look at the core of the problem, which is pain. You cannot solve the prescription drug problem until you solve the pain problem unless you want to ignore the suffering of 100 million Americans.” He characterized the Hopkins report as focused on risk management and law enforcement options, without attention to the needs of people in pain. “The long-term solution is that we need safer, more-effective, nonaddictive drugs developed and available for pain patients. No one is working on this. That’s a failure within the system.” Alexander said the development of those types of drugs is a laudable goal, but it is not practical in the immediate conversation. “Treatment developments do little to help the people dying today, and today 44 people will die of prescriptions to opioids,” he said. “We are looking at the immediate future and the likelihood of turning this around right now. We want comprehensive, concrete, evidence-based solutions.” Webster said he was neither pro- nor anti-opioid. “I am pro-patient. And today, opioids are our only option to treat many chronic pain conditions. It’s up to us to develop better methods.” As for this patient, I intend to stay with my two ibuprofen a day — and go to my primary-care doctor if I need help with pain.

"Every morning, former Air Force senior airman Amy Rising makes breakfast for her second-grader, drives him to school and returns home to prepare what she calls her medicine. She suffers from severe anxiety after four years working in the frenetic global command center at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, providing logistical and support services for bombings and other missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rising says she has found a treatment that helps her cope. But her local Veterans Affairs hospital does not provide it — because her medicine is a joint. At a time when the legalized use of marijuana is gaining greater acceptance across the country, Rising is among a growing number of veterans who are coming out of the “cannabis closet” and pressing the government to recognize pot as a legitimate treatment for the wounds of war. They say it is effective for addressing various physical and psychological conditions related to military service — from chronic back pain and neuropathic issues to panic attacks and insomnia — and often preferable to widely prescribed opioid painkillers and other drugs. Researchers in the United States and several other countries have found evidence that cannabis can help treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and pain, although studies — for instance, looking into the best strains and proper dosages — remain in the early stages. Veterans are lobbying for more states to legalize cannabis for medical use — 23 states and the District allow this — but the primary target is the federal government and, in particular, the Department of Veterans Affairs. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin and LSD, deeming that it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. That means that VA, which runs the largest network of hospitals and health clinics in the country, cannot prescribe pot as a treatment, even for veterans who live in a state where medical marijuana is legal. VA says that its physicians and chronic-pain specialists “are prohibited from recommending and prescribing medical marijuana for PTSD or other pain-related issues.” Medical staff are also prohibited from completing paperwork required to enroll in state marijuana programs because they are “federal employees who must comply with federal law,” said Gina Jackson, a VA spokeswoman. The swelling chorus of veterans who want to take advantage of marijuana but can’t reflects the growing disconnect between more tolerant state policies and the federal government’s unwillingness to budge. Advocates such as Rising say it is urgent that the federal government recognizes marijuana as a treatment because there are so many veterans of recent wars. Although Rising did not serve in Afghanistan or Iraq, she said the pressure of her work was intense. “What was really hard about working in command was never being able to see the damage you did on the ground,” she said. “You start to think about all the orphans and widows you created, and that you do hit civilians.” Without marijuana to treat what she says is PTSD, Rising said she feels “like the Incredible Hulk and that danger is around every corner and that my nerves could explode.” After dropping off her son at school on a recent morning, she prepared a pair of blunts. She took some pot out of a jar, dumped the guts of two Dutch Masters cigars and re-rolled them with the marijuana. Then she slipped her blue Air Force jacket over her blue and white flower-print dress and went into her suburban back yard to smoke, putting her long, blond curls behind her ears. Medical marijuana is legal for treating some conditions where Rising lives. She declined to identify her home state except to say it is in the Mid-Atlantic. “It’s not about getting stoned. It’s about getting help,” she said. “The VA doesn’t have any problem giving us addictive pharmaceutical drugs by the bagful.” Winning acceptance for medical marijuana, she said, involves convincing the government that there is more to the movement than “Cheech and Chong, a stoned vet burning one down to Bob Marley tunes.” If veterans report their use of marijuana to VA, they could face criminal charges if they live in a state where it is illegal. And though few have indeed been charged, the mere possibility has spawned a culture of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” said Michael Krawitz, a former Air Force staff sergeant and the director of Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access. VA medical staff have warned that this culture is making for a dangerous situation, especially as more states legalize medical marijuana, because doctors do not know about all of the medications their patients are using. Patients are not routinely given drug tests, but those who are prescribed large amounts of opiates and risk overdosing can be asked to undergo screenings, which can turn up marijuana use. In 2011, VA issued a directive that said patients who were participating in state marijuana programs for pain cannot lose their VA benefits. VA added that it is up to individual patients to craft their “treatment plans” in consultation with their doctors. Some patients say their VA doctors are making them choose between their prescription drugs and marijuana. “Doctors and administrators wrongly assume that the use of marijuana along with opiates is unsafe,” Krawitz said. A study published last month in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine reported that “people already taking opioids for pain may supplement with medical marijuana and be able to lower their painkiller dose, thus lowering their risk of overdose.” The study, written by Marcus A. Bachhuber, a researcher at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and several colleagues, found that “medical cannabis laws are associated with significantly lower state-level opioid overdose mortality rates.” Scott Murphy, a retired Army specialist who is the head of Veterans for Safe Access and Compassionate Care, has been compiling a petition asking that marijuana no longer be classified as a Schedule I drug. “Veterans in states without medical marijuana laws feel they need to lie to their physicians for the justifiable fear of losing their earned benefits,” Murphy writes in the petition. To counter widespread perceptions about pot users, Murphy makes sure to wear a suit when he lobbies on Capitol Hill and in his home state of Massachusetts, where medical marijuana is legal for some uses. “I won’t wear a tie-dyed shirt with a marijuana leaf,” he said. Murphy served in Iraq for more than a year, working in field artillery and training Iraqi police officers. He said the physical stress of lugging heavy military equipment contributed to degenerative arthritis and bone pain in his leg, hip and wrist, and he began taking morphine, muscle relaxers and Oxycontin. “It never took away the pain,” he said. “I was at the point where I just wanted my leg to be taken off.” Then, two years ago, he started using a liquid form of cannabis that he puts under his tongue. “I was able to go eight hours without taking my medication,” he said. Several VA doctors who specialize in pain management and PTSD said in interviews that they are eager for more research on the medical benefits of marijuana. The doctors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they do not have permission from VA to discuss marijuana with the news media, said they feel frustrated because prescription drugs are not helping patients who are suffering. “Anecdotally we know it works, and more and more studies are saying this,” said one VA doctor, a PTSD expert who leads a large East Coast VA pain center. “But we aren’t allowed to study it.” Researchers at New York University’s Langone Medical Center are developing the first generation of cannabis-related medications targeted for PTSD, according to Alexander Neumeister, an NYU professor who supervised three drug trials. He said research has found that people with PTSD have lower levels of unregulated receptors in the brain. These receptors, called CB1, are activated when a person uses marijuana. “We are throwing the wrong pills at the problem and keep doing it,” Neumeister said. “It’s upsetting. It’s heart-breaking and it’s just wrong.” He warned that marijuana for PTSD and pain is “not ready for prime time yet,” because there must be more research into the proper doses and the most effective strains. “We don't know enough about the side affects and long term negative effects,"" he said. Some veterans are not waiting for the studies to be finished. Mark DiPasquale, a 39-year-old retired Marine staff sergeant who served in Iraq from 2005 to 2007, said marijuana was his “exit drug.” To treat back and bone injuries as well as PTSD, he said he had gone on 22 medications, including opioids and anti-anxiety medication. “I realized none of these were working and I was about to be a father. I was so jacked up on every pharmaceutical,” he said. DiPasquale looked for alternatives. He decided to use marijuana, inhaling it with a vaporizer, to stop drinking alcohol and to adopt a largely vegan diet (he occasionally eats fish). The regimen has worked, he said. But he added that he has to spend a lot of money and time buying marijuana “from people I trust or seeing if a random cousin has some.” DiPasquale, who lives in New York — where voters have approved medical marijuana — wishes VA would consider dispensing pot. “It’s not like, ‘Let’s smoke a joint and feel better,’ ” he said. “We want to do it the right way.”"	729	"[{""start"": 838, ""end"": 1378, ""text"": ""They say it is effective for addressing various physical and psychological conditions related to military service — from chronic back pain and neuropathic issues to panic attacks and insomnia — and often preferable to widely prescribed opioid painkillers and other drugs.

A fascinating study in Health Affairs last year by a father-daughter pair of public policy researchers found that Medicare prescriptions for things like painkillers, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications dropped sharply in states that introduced a medical marijuana program. The implication? Offered the choice between taking medication prescribed by a doctor and self-medicating with pot, many older patients opted for the latter. But the study left one big question unanswered: Since the study's authors — the University of Georgia's Ashley Bradford and W. David Bradford — only looked at Medicare data, they couldn't say for sure whether the findings held for younger patients too. Now, we're getting more answers. This week, the Bradfords are back with a new study applying the same analysis to prescriptions under Medicaid, which covers low-income people of all ages. The results largely validate their previous work: Medicaid prescriptions for certain drugs fell significantly in states that adopted a medical marijuana law. Specifically, anti-nausea drug prescriptions fell by 17 percent. Antidepressant prescriptions fell 13 percent, while prescriptions for seizure and psychosis drugs fell 12 percent. Not everyone who has access to medical marijuana opts for it, obviously. But enough do to make a significant dent in the prescription numbers. “Patients and physicians in the community are reacting to the availability of medical marijuana as if it were medicine,” the Bradfords conclude. Perhaps most significantly from a public health standpoint, prescriptions for painkillers fell by 11 percent. Opiate painkillers are behind much of the current drug overdose epidemic. Numerous studies have found that opiate abuse and overdose rates fell in states with medical marijuana laws. The Bradfords' research describes the mechanism by which that could happen: the introduction of medical marijuana laws coincides with a drop in painkiller prescriptions. The Bradfords' data only include prescriptions made under Medicare and Medicaid, but given the totality of their evidence it seems reasonable to assume that similar patterns hold true for patients on private insurance plans. In the current budgetary environment, no analysis of health care is complete without a discussion of costs. The Bradfords estimate that because of the drops in prescribing rates, a nationwide medical marijuana program would save taxpayers about $1.1 billion on Medicaid prescriptions annually. That's on top of the half a billion in Medicare savings the Bradfords estimated last year. Those costs don't evaporate into thin air, of course: they would simply be shifted over to seniors and low-income people who would be purchasing medical marijuana outside of their insurance programs. There's also the open question of how smart it is from a personal health perspective to be self-medicating with pot: “it is plausible that forgoing medications with known safety, efficacy, and dosing profiles in favor of marijuana could be harmful under some circumstances,” the Bradfords warn. Still, the Bradfords' research makes the gulf between our current medical understanding of marijuana and federal policy around it even wider. Last summer the DEA affirmed yet again marijuana's status in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, a category reserved for the most dangerous, addictive drugs that have no medical applications. “This decision was made despite the substantial and growing evidence that the requirements for Schedule I status involving 'no currently accepted medical uses' are no longer met by marijuana,” the Bradfords write.	728	"[{""start"": 2, ""end"": 280, ""text"": ""ascinating study in Health Affairs last year by a father-daughter pair of public policy researchers found that Medicare prescriptions for things like painkillers, antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications dropped sharply in states that introduced a medical marijuana program"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 880, ""end"": 1217, ""text"": ""The results largely validate their previous work: Medicaid prescriptions for certain drugs fell significantly in states that adopted a medical marijuana law.

"Dozens of public health officials and academics across the country are pushing the Food and Drug Administration to warn people about the potential dangers of taking powerful prescription painkillers alongside common anti-anxiety drugs known as benzodiazepines. In a petition submitted to the agency Monday, 41 officials from various state and municipal health departments, as well as from some universities, urged the agency to add so-called ""black box"" warnings to both types of medications, given evidence that using them together increases the chance of deadly overdoses. ""The science clearly demonstrates that this is a potentially fatal combination, when opioids and benzodiazepines are prescribed together,"" said Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of Rhode Island's Department of Health, saying doctors and public health officials have a moral and professional obligation to be transparent about the risks and be cautious when prescribing the drugs to patients. Opioids, which include narcotic painkillers such as Oxycodone and Hydrocodone, are at the heart of a deadly nationwide epidemic of abuse and addiction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that overdose deaths from legal opioids grew to nearly 19,000 in the United States in 2014, the most recent year on record. The drugs also have played a role in a surge of overdoses in recent years of heroin, which is cheaper and more widely available than prescription opioids. At the same time, according to a study last week in the American Journal of Public Health, overdose deaths also have been soaring among Americans who use benzodiazepines, a class of sedatives that includes medications such as Valium and Xanax. Researchers found that the death rate from overdoses involving benzodiazepines -- commonly referred to as ""benzos"" -- had increased more than four-fold since 1996. In 2013, they noted, deaths from benzodiazepine overdoses accounted for nearly a third of the 23,000 deaths attributed to prescription drug overdoses in the United States. In Monday's petition, health officials detailed data suggesting that both types of medication become only more risky when used together -- and they are used together frequently. Often, for example, doctors will prescribe opioids to a patient with acute pain, along with a benzodiazepine to treat muscle spasms. Or benzodiazepines for a patient with an anxiety disorder, along with an opioid to treat chronic pain. ""It’s not based on evidence, but it is routine clinical practice,"" said Baltimore City Health Commissioner Leana Wen. A black box warning, she said, could make doctors more cautious and patients better informed.

UNNATURAL CAUSES SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA | Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. Read part one, part two, part three, part four and part five. BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — Karen Franklin leans against the sink in the pink-tiled bathroom of her childhood home, counting out pills. There’s a purple morphine tablet for chronic back pain, a blue Xanax for anxiety and a white probiotic for her stomach, which aches from all the other pills. In all, Franklin, 60, takes more than a dozen different prescription drugs, washing them down with tap water and puffing on a Marlboro while she waits for them to kick in. “They take the edge off, but that’s about it,” Franklin says. So she keeps a bottle of vodka handy for added relief, increasing her risk of joining the legions of American women dying from ­prescription-drug overdoses. While death rates are falling for blacks and Hispanics in middle age, whites are dying prematurely in growing numbers, particularly white women. One reason: a big increase in overdoses, primarily from opioids, but also from anti-anxiety drugs, which are often prescribed in tandem. Between 1999 and 2014, the number of middle-aged white women dying annually from opiate overdoses shot up 400 percent, according to a Washington Post analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Anti-anxiety drugs known as benzodiazepines contributed to a growing share of the 54,000 deaths over that period, reaching a third in the past several years, The Post found — though spotty reporting in death records means it is likely that the combination is even more widespread. Both drugs depress the central nervous system, temporarily easing pain and anxiety while suppressing respiration, heart rate and the gag reflex. Alcohol has the same effect, and combining any of these can be fatal. “They act like a dimmer switch on the central nervous system,” said Rear Adm. Susan Blumenthal, former U.S. assistant surgeon general and an expert on women’s health issues. “When taken in combination, a person’s breathing and heart will slow down, and can ultimately stop. People can go to sleep and never wake up.” White women are more likely than women of other races to be prescribed opiates, and far more likely to be prescribed both opiates and anti-anxiety drugs, according to an analysis of middle-aged participants in the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. White women prescribed opiates are five times as likely as white men to be given that drug combination — helping to explain why white women may be at special risk. Federal health officials have recognized the danger. This spring, in a guideline that urged doctors to reduce the use of opioids for chronic pain, the CDC warned against prescribing them together with benzodiazepines, except for patients battling fatal diseases such as cancer. At the very least, the CDC urged doctors to warn patients of the risks, especially when the drugs are mixed with alcohol. On Thursday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began requiring warning labels on opioids and benzodiazepines — nearly 400 products in total — with information about the potentially fatal consequences of taking these medications at the same time. “It is nothing short of a public health crisis when you see a substantial increase of avoidable overdose and death related to two widely used drug classes being taken together,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement. “We implore health care professionals to heed these new warnings and more carefully and thoroughly evaluate, on a patient-by-patient basis, whether the benefits of using opioids and benzodiazepines — or CNS depressants more generally — together outweigh these serious risks.” Federal officials have no power to mandate a change in doctors’ prescribing habits. Even if they did, a mandate would do little for patients such as Franklin who get their prescriptions from multiple physicians. “An opioid might be prescribed by a pain specialist while a general practitioner or a psychologist may prescribe the benzodiazepine. They may not know about one another,” said Deborah Dowell, lead author of the CDC’s new opioid guidelines. Franklin’s struggle began 17 years ago with a single prescription for Vicodin. At the time, she had her own home and managed a grocery store. But the side effects of long-term opioid use soon set in. Mounting anxiety. Sleeplessness. Depression. With each new problem, doctors sent her home with more pills. Now she lives with her 88-year-old father and spends her days shuffling between the TV, a refrigerator stocked with chocolate Ensure and the bathroom, which relatives call her sanctuary. Armed with a Bible and a carton of Marlboros, she prays for God’s protection, cracking the bathroom window to let the cigarette smoke drift into the back yard. Lately, Franklin has been blacking out. Her sister found her facedown in a plate of food, and she started using a walker after losing consciousness on her way to the mailbox. “What is happening right now is a slow suicide,” said her friend Ellen Eggert, a supervisor for the Kern County Mental Health Department. But Franklin is resisting Eggert’s appeals to seek help with her addictions. “I know it’s not good for me,” Franklin said. “But I would rather say my prayers and take my medication.” Suicides have doubled Bakersfield lies in the heart of Kern County, a vast sprawl of lush cropland in California’s Central Valley. Here, accidental overdoses among white women have tripled since 1999, according to federal health data, and suicides have doubled. The death toll has alarmed health-care workers like Eggert and given rise to a loose network of therapists, nurses, pastors and drug counselors struggling to understand a generation of women overwhelmed by modern life and undone by modern medicine. Some, like Franklin, begin their descent after an injury. Others seek relief from conditions related to menopause. Middle-aged women also are more likely than men to suffer from a variety of painful conditions, including lupus, migraines and rheumatoid arthritis. Whatever the complaint, doctors and drug companies have since the late 1990s responded with highly addictive painkillers, many of them central nervous system depressants previously reserved for the terminally ill. The more expansive use of opioids has fed an epidemic of dependency, leading to new prescriptions for anti-anxiety drugs and a rash of fatal overdoses. These drugs appear to be a factor even among suicides, another major contributor to rising female mortality. According to Kern County coroner records obtained by The Post, 85 white women ages 35 to 60 killed themselves here over the past seven years. About half overdosed on prescription drugs, The Post found, and about half of those — 21 women — had some combination of opioids, benzodiazepines and alcohol in their bloodstreams. Many of the women who chose other means of suicide, such as gunshot or hanging, also died in a haze of prescription drugs, The Post found. In nearly half of the 28 cases in which a toxicology test was performed, the women had consumed opioids, benzodiazepines or other central nervous system depressants. When a woman dies in Kern County, it falls to Coroner Manager Dawn Ratliff to determine what happened. Her investigators explore medicine cabinets, flip through journals, scrutinize text messages and interview friends. Repeatedly, a pattern emerges, Ratliff said: A personal crisis leads to prescriptions to soothe the pain. And then they lose control. “They are worn down. And they can’t rise above it,” said Ratliff, who puts the blame in part on the rise of social media, which can create unrealistic expectations about how life should go. “Before, if you lived in a rural area, all you knew was your community. You just knew what people in your community looked like, what their lives were like. You didn’t expect to look like a movie star — or live like one,” she said. Ratliff, 60, works closely with Eggert, 58, who created an outreach team for surviving family members of suicides that has been lauded as a national model. Eggert said she, too, has noticed the weariness and the desire for a quick fix to life’s problems. “Women have had to be strong for so long. Opioids are a good way out. Benzos are a good way out,” Eggert said. Women “start depending on them to get through. Then, after a while, it’s not getting them through anymore. It’s running their life.” The autopsy reports are filled with stories of dependency: Bonnie Jean Marshall, 54, overdosed in 2012 after drinking alcohol and taking three prescription drugs, including the opioid Vicodin and the benzodiazepine Xanax. She lived in Wofford Heights, a village in the southern Sierra Nevada, and suffered from hypertension, pain and anxiety. She left a suicide note: “Sick for months—can’t get well so sorry nana.” Holi Michele Mitchell, 43, shot herself in 2014 after taking Vicodin and two benzodiazepines — Klonopin and Xanax. She lived in Bodfish, a small town in the Kern River Valley, and struggled with depression after her son died in a car accident. His picture and a broken charm bracelet were found by her body. Cheryl Moore, 56, left a journal that described two suicide attempts in the weeks before she overdosed on painkillers and alcohol in February 2015. Moore, who lived in Bakersfield, had begun taking opiates 18 months earlier after breaking her ankle. Then her husband, Duane, died of liver cancer, leaving a stockpile of stronger painkillers. Moore’s brother, Eugene Frey, said he understands why women might turn to suicide, even when, like his sister, they have the means to seek treatment. “There is an expectation for them to keep it together. People think: ‘Hey, you are white. You are privileged. So why do you have so many problems? Maybe you are the problem,’ ” Frey said. “There isn’t a lot of space for them to be vulnerable.” Cultural shift Eggert is part of a network of female health professionals working to understand the increase in white female mortality in Kern County. She said that she believes it is rooted in the cultural shift of the 1960s. As taboos were stripped away, women began drinking, smoking and medicating themselves more like men. As they aged, they began to suffer the effects: Since 1999, the death rate from alcohol abuse has more than doubled among white women ages 45 to 54, according to CDC data, though the rate for white men remains twice as high. “It’s become normalized,” Eggert said. “Why does alcohol kill more people than all the other drugs combined? Because it’s acceptable, available, and there’s not a thing wrong with it. Why do women fail to see the danger of taking so many pills? Because it’s legitimate. It comes from a doctor.” Joan Knowlden, a psychologist in Kern County, said she saw a sharp rise in middle-aged female patients in the early 2000s. Many had turned to alcohol, ­anti-anxiety drugs and painkillers to “mellow them out.” Some had delayed childbearing, Knowlden said, and were trying to raise children just as they reached their peak professionally. Many were also entering menopause, which typically causes a drop in serotonin, a chemical that naturally soothes the brain. “With perimenopause and menopause, you already have anxiety, sleep loss, loss of bladder control and loss of sex drive,” Knowlden said. “It can just become too much.” Sometimes, Knowlden sends her clients to Sherri Bergamo, a nurse practitioner known as “the Hormone Queen of Bakersfield.” Bergamo noted that the rise of opioid painkillers coincided with a shift in treatment for menopausal women: Doctors stopped prescribing hormone-replacement therapy after studies found it increased the risk of stroke, blood clots and breast cancer. Forced to “white knuckle” their way through menopause, Bergamo said, many women sought other forms of relief for mood swings and depression. She offers them custom-mixed hormones, which she argues are safer. “There are some risks, but they are calculated, and they are carefully monitored,” said Bergamo, 74, who has undergone hormone therapy for 26 years. “I believe it saves lives.” Medicine is coming back around to Bergamo’s point of view. This year, a panel of experts assembled by the North American Menopause Society concluded that hormone replacement is largely safe, especially for women under 60. In October, the society plans to recommend a return to hormone therapy for most healthy women, according to executive director JoAnn Pinkerton, division director of the Midlife Health Center at the University of Virginia Health System. One thing menopausal women should probably avoid is long-term opioid use, which can further lower hormone levels, said Stanford University professor Beth Darnall, who specializes in pain psychology research. “When women go through menopause, there are big changes with pain, anxiety and depression. There is a hard body of research on this,” Darnall said. “Opioids, taken long term, reduce the level of hormones in the body. This can lead to a greater sensitivity to pain. And it can feed into this dose-escalation cycle.” The turning point The turning point in Franklin’s life came in the late 1990s, when she said her tailbone was fractured during an episode of domestic violence. The pain led her to Vicodin, starting with the lowest dose: tablets containing five milligrams of the opioid hydrocodone. “It might as well have been baby aspirin,” she says now. “All it did was make me a little sleepy.” At the time, Franklin was managing a grocery store, a physically demanding job that had her lifting Halloween pumpkins, boxes of Easter candy and endless cases of soda. Within a few months, she persuaded her doctor to double the dose. Then she begged for stronger opiates, cycling through prescriptions for codeine, oxycodone and OxyContin. Periodically, her doctors cut her off. “They would say, ‘You kind of like this too much,’ ’’ Franklin recalled. So she would call 911 and take a trip to the emergency room, where doctors typically offered a shot of Demerol, another powerful opioid. In the early 2000s, Franklin’s mother died, her second marriage began to unravel, and she decided to quit working. Doctors added antidepressants, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medications to her list of prescriptions. Her world began to narrow. She saw fewer people. Franklin said she became “a hermit.” Her friend Eggert suggested a psychologist, group therapy, long walks, church, yoga. Franklin rejected each idea. She came to believe she needed surgery. So in 2004, a surgeon implanted metal rods at the base of her spine. The surgery failed to provide relief, and Franklin filed for disability. “I was told it would be 80 percent better,” she said, “but instead it was 80 percent worse.” Franklin keeps an X-ray of her back clipped to her refrigerator. If anyone questions her pain, she points to the X-ray: “They see those plates and they know it’s bad.” In recent months, her chronic drug use has generated a host of new health problems, including pancreatitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Those conditions led to more doctor visits, which produced more prescriptions, and more pills to shake out of more bottles in her pink-tiled bathroom. Her bottle of vodka, once stowed under the bathroom sink, now stays out on the floor, within easy reach.

America is in pain — and being killed by its painkillers. It starts with drugs such as OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin — prescription narcotics that can make days bearable if you are recovering from surgery or suffering from cancer. But they can be as addictive as heroin and are rife with deadly side effects. Use of these and other opioids has skyrocketed in recent years. Prescriptions have climbed 300 percent in the past decade, and Vicodin and other drugs containing the narcotic hydrocodone are now the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. With that increased use have come increased deaths: 46 people per day, or almost 17,000 people per year, die from overdoses of the drugs. That’s up more than 400 percent from 1999. And for every death, more than 30 people go to an emergency room because of opioid complications. With numbers like that, some argue that the Food and Drug Administration would do all it could to reverse the trend. But against the recommendation of its own panel of expert advisers, the agency last December approved Zohydro ER, a long-acting version of hydrocodone. “We think the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks,” says Douglas Throckmorton, who oversees regulation of drugs for the FDA. He says that Zohydro ER offers an option to some people in pain and that the FDA has taken steps to make all opioids safer by, for example, requiring stronger warnings on drug labels. The FDA says it will also keep a close eye on how Zohydro ER is used in the marketplace. But attorneys general from 28 states have asked the FDA to reconsider its decision because the drug offers no clear advantages over others already on the market and its potency makes it a target for misuse and abuse. And more than a dozen Republican and Democratic members of Congress have signed a bill that would ban Zohydro ER. Deadly misconceptions One of the biggest misconceptions people have about opioids is that the risks apply to other people, not themselves. But the typical victim of overdose might not be whom you think. About 60 percent of overdoses occur in people prescribed the drugs by a single physician, not in those who “doctor-shopped” or who got the drugs on the black market. And a third of those were taking a low dose. Used properly, opioids can ease severe short-term pain from, say, surgery or a broken bone. But people run into trouble when they inadvertently misuse the drugs — combining them with alcohol or other drugs (such as sleeping pills), taking them in too high a dose or for too long, or using them while driving or in other situations when they need to be alert. The general public and health-care providers harbor outdated and dangerous notions about opioids. Here are three of the biggest misconceptions and the facts you need to know to stay safe: ●Misconception: Opioids work well for chronic pain. Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts longer than three to six months and that is not associated with a terminal illness. An estimated 90 percent of people with chronic pain wind up being prescribed an opioid despite little evidence that the drugs help much or are safe in such situations. People who take opioids for more than a few weeks often develop tolerance, so they require higher doses, which breeds dependence. And although higher doses can ease pain, they commonly cause nausea and constipation, disrupt your immune system and sex life, and leave you feeling too fuzzy-headed to participate in things such as physical activity that can speed your recovery. And in a cruel twist, the drugs can make some people more sensitive to pain. The safer approach:For certain types of pain — including nerve pain, migraines and fibromyalgia — other prescription medications usually work better than opioids. For other types of chronic pain, ask your doctor about trying over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen before prescription drugs. Nondrug measures such as exercise, massage, behavioral therapy and acupuncture might also help. ● Misconception: Opioids are not addictive when used to treat pain. Between 5 and 25 percent of people who use prescription pain pills long-term get addicted. Fewer women are dependent on prescription painkillers than men, but they may become dependent more quickly and are more likely to doctor-shop. The safer approach: Chronic pain often waxes and wanes. If you and your doctor feel you need an opioid, reserve it for flare-ups. ● Misconception: Extended-release versions are safer. Opioids such as hydromorphone (Exalgo), oxycodone (OxyContin and related generics), morphine (Avinza, MS Contin and generics), and the newly approved Zohydro ER stay in the body longer and are usually stronger than short-acting opioids. They should be reserved for patients who need round-the-clock relief. But doctors sometimes prescribe them for convenience — patients need to take fewer pills — and because they believe that long-acting drugs are less likely to cause a drug high and lead to addiction. But there’s no evidence those drugs work better or are safer than short-acting ones. The safer approach: It’s usually best to start with a short-acting opioid. Because long-acting drugs are more likely to be stolen, misused and abused, expect careful monitoring if your doctor prescribes one. “For example, your physician may insist that you return for regular visits or that he count your pills to ensure that you are taking them on the prescribed schedule.

Veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other chronic pain issues may be able to ask their VA doctors for a new treatment soon: medical marijuana. This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to back the Veterans Equal Access Amendment. Under the measure, Veterans Affairs (VA) would be allowed to recommend medical marijuana to patients for medicinal purposes for everything from back pain to depression to flashbacks. Veterans who support the proposal say that it is safer and helps more than the addictive and debilitating painkillers that are often prescribed. They say using medical cannabis can help combat PTSD’s insomnia and panic attacks. The legislation would overturn VA’s policy that forbids doctors from talking to patients about medical pot use. [More veterans press VA to recognize medical marijuana as treatment option] Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who introduced the legislation, argued that forbidding VA doctors from talking about the option of medical marijuana is unconstitutional. He said that First Amendment rights include the right of patients to discuss whatever they want with their doctors. “They can’t discuss all the options available to them that they could discuss if they literally walked next door to a non-VA facility,” he said. “I don’t believe we should discriminate against veterans just because they are in the care of the VA.” While medical marijuana is legal in the District and 23 states, the federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, like heroin and LSD. That means it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. VA physicians and chronic-pain specialists say they often want to suggest the drug but haven’t been able to. Several studies have shown that states that allow medical marijuana for health purposes also found a decrease in the number of painkiller-related overdoses. “Veterans in medical marijuana states should be treated the same as any other resident, and should be able to discuss marijuana with their doctor and use it if it’s medically necessary,” Michael Collins, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. “They have served this country valiantly, so the least we can do is allow them to have full and open discussions with their doctors.”	724	"[{""start"": 592, ""end"": 674, ""text"": ""They say using medical cannabis can help combat PTSD’s insomnia and panic attacks."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1728, ""end"": 1883, ""text"": ""everal studies have shown that states that allow medical marijuana for health purposes also found a decrease in the number of painkiller-related overdoses"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1394, ""end"": 1617, ""text"": ""While medical marijuana is legal in the District and 23 states, the federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, like heroin and LSD.

During Prohibition, people were able to legally consume alcohol if they received a prescription from a doctor, similar to how residents of some states are able to legally consume marijuana. Here’s how that worked. In what states was medical liquor legal? In all 48 states (Alaska and Hawaii were not granted statehood until 1959, 26 years after Prohibition was repealed). Medical liquor was regulated by the U.S. Treasury department and not the states, like medical marijuana is. Pharmacies’ ease of obtaining permits to fill prescriptions varied by geography, author Daniel Okrent wrote in “Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition,” according to Smithsonian. Pharmacies in big cities, on the coasts and along the Canadian border had an easier time. In what states is medical marijuana legal? Today, 23 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing at least some form of medical marijuana, including Colorado and Washington, which have also legalized recreational use. The amount of marijuana someone can posses varies by state. In Alaska, Montana and Nevada, individuals are limited to one ounce, while in Oregon, one can possess up to 24 ounces. What qualified someone for medical liquor? Prescriptions for medical liquor were available to patients with anemia, tuberculosis, pneumonia, high blood pressure and other disorders, according to the History Channel. The American Medical Association actually adopted a resolution in June 1917, less than three years before Prohibition began, stating alcohol’s use as a “therapeutic agent” had no scientific value and “should be further discouraged.” However , alcohol had long been used for medical purposes, including during the Civil War to treat soldiers’ pain when they ran out of other painkillers. What qualifies someone for medical marijuana? In California, which in 1996 became the first state to legalize medical marijuana, its Department of Public Health allows marijuana to be used by those with a “serious medical condition,” including AIDS, anorexia, arthritis, cachexia, cancer, chronic pain, glaucoma, migraines, persistent muscle spasms, seizures, severe nausea or any other chronic medical symptom that limits their life activities or would cause serious harm to their physical or mental safety if untreated. How did someone apply for medical liquor? Patients had to receive a prescription from a doctor that noted the kind of alcohol they were to receive, and a dosage, according to Okrent. It usually cost $3 for a prescription and $3 or $4 to have it filled at a pharmacy, Okrent wrote, or about $40 in today’s dollars. Quality varied, ranging from cheap alcohol to well-known brands like Jack Daniel’s, which included a phrasing “Unexcelled for Medicinal Purposes” on its label. How does someone apply for medicinal marijuana? Applying varies by state. In California, a resident must receive a doctor’s recommendation and provide that along with proof of identity and proof of residency in their county. The state charges a fee of $33 to $66.  The highest fee in the country is the $200 charged by Minnesota, New Jersey and Oregon, while in Maine and New Mexico, there is no fee. How much medical liquor could someone possess? The maximum legal prescription was for one pint of alcohol every 10 days, according to Okrent. How much medical marijuana can someone possess? It varies greatly by state. In Alaska, Montana and Nevada, it’s legal to possess one ounce of usable marijuana, in addition to plants, while in Oregon and Washington, it’s legal to posess 24 ounces of usable marijuana in addition to plants.	723	"[{""start"": 797, ""end"": 987, ""text"": ""Today, 23 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing at least some form of medical marijuana, including Colorado and Washington, which have also legalized recreational use"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	700	2023-04-26T00:03:09.670827Z	2023-04-26T00:03:09.670910Z	292.982
"John Kasich signed Ohio's medical marijuana bill into law yesterday, making it the 25th state (26 counting Washington, D.C.) to allow some form of medical marijuana use. Ohio's measure is more restrictive than medical marijuana bills in many other states. It does not allow patients to smoke marijuana -- they must ingest it orally via edible products, or use a vaporizer. It doesn't allow patients to grow their own marijuana, and only a handful of conditions, including epilepsy, chronic pain and cancer, qualify for a medical marijuana recommendation. Medical marijuana advocates had launched a campaign to put a broader medical marijuana bill before voters this fall. But the bill approved by legislature and signed by Gov. Kasich was in many tended to stave off more permissive ballot measures. And it appears to have been successful: the group pushing for the ballot initiative recently suspended that campaign, calling the legislature's bill ""imperfect"" but saying the bill's passage represented ""a joyous day for the thousands of Ohioans who will finally be able to safely access much-needed medicine. This year has been a symbolically significant year for medical marijuana policy: with the passage of legislation in Pennsylvania and Ohio nearly 175 million Americans -- over half of the population -- now have access to medical marijuana. These changes are putting pressure on the federal government to update a decades-old marijuana policy that most experts agree is out of step with current scientific understanding of the drug and its risks and benefits. The Drug Enforcement Administration has, since the 1970s, classified marijuana under the most highly restrictive category of regulation: Schedule 1, meaning it has ""no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse."" Marijuana shares this designation with heroin. But drug science has come a long way since the 1970s. Researchers now know that marijuana is actually one of the least-addictive mind-altering drugs. Even chronic uses poses few serious risks to physical health. Most importantly, at least for federal classification purposes, marijuana has been shown to have great promise when it comes to medical use. It's been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic pain. Given that people with this condition are routinely prescribed powerful painkillers that cause tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year, broader use of medical marijuana in these cases would quite literally save lives. But neither the research, nor more widespread public acceptance, have so far prompted drug authorities to relax federal restrictions on marijuana. The biggest marijuana-related change at the DEA in the past year was an acknowledgement by the administration's chief that heroin is in fact more dangerous than marijuana. The DEA Administrator still believes that medical marijuana is ""a joke."" The DEA is currently in the final stages of reviewing a petition to re-schedule marijuana and has told lawmakers it will have a final decision by July. Advocates of medical marijuana reforms say the petition represents a chance to bring the agency more in line with public opinion, scientific consensus, and the lived experience of millions of medical marijuana patients."	722	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 168, ""text"": ""John Kasich signed Ohio's medical marijuana bill into law yesterday, making it the 25th state (26 counting Washington, D.C.) to allow some form of medical marijuana use"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1110, ""end"": 1348, ""text"": ""This year has been a symbolically significant year for medical marijuana policy: with the passage of legislation in Pennsylvania and Ohio nearly 175 million Americans -- over half of the population -- now have access to medical marijuana."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1984, ""end"": 2140, ""text"": ""esearchers now know that marijuana is actually one of the least-addictive mind-altering drugs.

"After states pass laws permitting medical marijuana, drivers in those states become less likely to test positive for opioids after fatal car accidents, a new study from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health has found. Researchers analyzed federal crash data in 18 states over the period from 1999 to 2013. States that passed a medical marijuana law during this period saw a reduction in opioid involvement in fatal car accidents, relative to states without such a law. The reduction was greatest among drivers aged 21 to 40, the age group most likely to use medical marijuana where it's available. ""We would expect the adverse consequences of opioid use to decrease over time in states where medical marijuana use is legal, as individuals substitute marijuana for opioids in the treatment of severe or chronic pain,"" said June H. Kim, a doctoral student at the Mailman School of Public Health, and the study's lead author, in a press release. The study, published today in the American Journal of Public Health, is the first to look at the relationship between medical marijuana laws and individual-level laboratory measurements of opioid use. The results suggest a fairly straightforward conclusion that ""in states with medical marijuana laws, fewer individuals are using opioids,"" the authors write. It adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic pain patients may substitute marijuana for prescription painkillers in states where the option is available. One paper published earlier this year found that Medicare Part D prescriptions for painkillers declined significantly in states that passed medical marijuana laws. Other studies have shown that medical marijuana states see fewer painkiller overdose deaths than states without medical pot, and that access to medical marijuana dispensaries is also linked to declining rates of opiate overdose and death. In a sign some drugmakers might be worried about marijuana's impact, the company behind the powerful painkiller fentanyl recently poured half a million dollars into the campaign opposing full marijuana legalization in Arizona, one of the biggest-ever single donations to an anti-legalization cause. Medical marijuana is currently legal, with varying degrees of restriction, in 25 states plus the District of Columbia. Still, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration earlier this year refused to relax restrictions on marijuana, claiming that the drug has no medically accepted use. The DEA is also moving to increase restrictions on another natural drug, kratom, that some opiate addicts say they have used to kick their painkiller habit. In 2014, painkiller overdoses killed nearly 19,000 people, according to the CDC. According to the DEA, no overdose death from marijuana has ever been recorded.

UNNATURAL CAUSES SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA: Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. Read the other stories in this series here. Cancer patients taking high doses of opioid painkillers are often afflicted by a new discomfort: constipation. Researcher Jonathan Moss thought he could help, but no drug company was interested in his ideas for relieving suffering among the dying. So Moss and his colleagues pieced together small grants and, in 1997, received permission to test their treatment. But not on cancer patients. Federal regulators urged them to use a less frail — and by then, rapidly expanding — group: addicts caught in the throes of a nationwide opioid epidemic. Suddenly, Moss said, investors were knocking at his door. “As clinicians, we wanted to help palliative patients,” said Moss, a professor and physician at University of Chicago Medicine. “The company that bought our work saw a broader market.” Today, Moss’s side project is hailed as the next billion-dollar drug. And the once-disinterested pharmaceutical industry is bombarding doctors and the public with information about a serious, if previously unrecognized, condition common among the millions of Americans who take prescription painkillers. They call it “opioid-induced constipation,” or “OIC.” The story of OIC illuminates the opportunism of pharmaceutical innovators and the consequences of a heavily drug-dependent society. Six in 10 American adults take prescription drugs, creating a vast market for new meds to treat the side effects of the old ones. Opioid prescriptions alone have skyrocketed from 112 million in 1992 to nearly 249 million in 2015, the latest year for which numbers are available, and America’s dependence on the drugs has reached crisis levels. Millions are addicted to or abusing prescription painkillers such as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that, from 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people died in the United States from prescription-opioid overdoses, which have contributed to a startling increase in early mortality among whites, particularly women — a devastating toll that has hit hardest in small towns and rural areas. The pharmaceutical industry’s response has been more drugs. The opioid market — now worth nearly $10 billion a year in sales in the United States — has expanded to include a growing universe of medications aimed at treating secondary effects rather than controlling pain. There’s Suboxone, financed and promoted by the U.S. government as a safer alternative to methadone for those trying to break their dependence on opioids. There’s naloxone, the emergency injection and nasal spray carried by first responders to treat overdoses. And now there’s Relistor, the drug based on Moss’s work, and a competitor, Movantik, for constipation. In colorful charts designed to entice investors, numerous pharmaceutical makers tout the “expansion opportunity” that exists in the “opioid use disorders population.” Indivior, a specialty pharmaceutical company listed on the London Stock Exchange, sees “around 2.5m potential patients, the majority of whom are addicted to prescription painkillers,” as opposed to illicit drugs such as heroin. Another company, New Jersey-based Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, highlights “growth drivers” for the market, noting that millions of additional Americans not yet identified are also likely to be dependent on opioid painkillers. Analysts estimate that each of these submarkets — addiction, overdose and side effects — is worth at least $1 billion a year in sales. These economics, experts say, work against efforts to end the epidemic. If opioid addiction disappeared tomorrow, it would wipe billions of dollars from the drug companies’ bottom lines. A potent product From a profit-making standpoint, opioids are a potent product. Chronic use can cause myriad side effects that usually are mild enough to keep people taking painkillers but sufficiently uncomfortable to send them back to the doctor. Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said this domino effect can turn a patient worth a few hundred dollars a month into one worth several thousand dollars a month. “Many patients wind up very sedated from opioids, and it’s not uncommon to give them amphetamines to make them more alert. But now they can’t sleep, so they get Ambien or Lunesta. The amphetamines also make them anxious, paranoid and sweaty, and that means even more drugs,” said Kolodny, who also serves as chief medical officer to Phoenix House, a nonprofit organization that offers drug and alcohol treatment in 10 states and the District. Women, in particular, are ideal customers. About 57 percent of working-age women who take opioids have four or more prescriptions, according to a Washington Post analysis of participants in the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among working-age women who don’t take opioids, 14 percent have four or more prescriptions, the analysis shows. Among men, the numbers are significantly lower. About 41 percent of working-age men on prescription opioids have at least four prescriptions. Among men who don’t take opioids, 9 percent have four or more. Studies show that constipation afflicts 40 percent to 90 percent of opioid patients. As recently as a few years ago, doctors typically advised people to cut down the dosages of their pain meds, to take them less often, or to try non-drug interventions such as changing their diets or increasing physical activity. By promoting opioid-induced constipation as a condition in need of more targeted treatment, critics say the drug industry is creating incentives to maintain the painkillers at full strength and add another pill instead. “The pharmaceutical industry literally created the problem [of OIC],” Kolodny said. “They named it, and they started advertising what a serious issue it is. And now they’ve got the solution for it.” A Super Bowl ad Opioid-induced constipation burst onto the biggest possible public stage in February, when AstraZeneca, maker of Movantik, aired a spot during Super Bowl 50 , one of the most expensive ad opportunities of the year. It featured a middle-aged man wistfully watching another man triumphantly adjusting his belt, a dog peacefully relieving itself under a tree and a woman striding by with a banner of toilet paper trailing victoriously from one high-heeled shoe. “If you need an opioid to manage your chronic pain, you may be so constipated it feels like everyone can go — except you,” a narrator intones. That ad was aimed at men, but many others in the Movantik campaign target women, airing on “Good Morning America,” movies on the Hallmark Channel and specials about former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, Princess Diana and singer Whitney Houston. In one, a slightly overweight dark-blonde woman talks about “struggling to find relief.” In another, a giant cartoon pill looms sympathetically over a middle-aged brunette, who complains that opioids really helped with her pain but left her with some “baggage.” “So awkward,” she sighs. The Super Bowl ad, aired before an audience of more than 100 million people, quickly became the latest flash point in the country’s war against opioids. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) called the ad “a shameful attempt to exploit America’s addiction crisis to boost corporate profits.” White House chief of staff Denis McDonough tweeted: “Next year, how about fewer ads that fuel opioid addiction and more on access to treatment.” AstraZeneca and its marketing partner Daiichi Sankyo defended the commercials, calling opioid-induced constipation “a legitimate medical condition” affecting millions of Americans. “The ad has driven good dialogue about OIC, and just as importantly, also added to the increasing and necessary conversation about the appropriate and safe use of opioids,” a spokeswoman said. Paul Gileno, president of the U.S. Pain Foundation, a patient advocacy group that worked with AstraZeneca on the ads, notes that many people use opioids responsibly. “People ask, ‘Why are you helping addicts?’ That’s not the case,” Gileno said. “We are trying to help people who are suffering from chronic pain to be able to continue on their medicines and live their lives.” A ‘brilliant’ pitch Each tiny pink pill of Movantik retails for about $10, and most insurance plans cover it. Since the Super Bowl, prescriptions have jumped from 6,600 to 8,800 a week, AstraZeneca recently reported. Movantik holds the dominant market share, but Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals — one of the companies under fire by Congress for jacking up prices of old drugs — won approval in July from the Food and Drug Administration to sell Relistor, its version of the pill. Analysts estimate that as many as six other drugs may be on the market by 2019. Investors have been talking about the “blockbuster potential” of these drugs since at least 2008, when Movantik had been tested on only a small number of human subjects, and long before it received FDA approval in 2014. While it is illegal to market a drug before approval, it is fine to market the condition the drug is designed to treat. And so “OIC” was born. The branding began around 2010, when “OIC” began appearing in papers in some of the top medical journals, in poster presentations and on the lips of panelists speaking at major medical conferences. “Opioid-induced constipation” suddenly replaced what had been a vast vocabulary used to describe the problem, including terms such as “bowel dysfunction” and “gut motility.” Last year, after it won government approval to sell Movantik, AstraZeneca rolled out a number of free continuing-education classes. Doctors and nurses must take such classes to remain licensed. The titles included: Opioid-induced Constipation: A Neglected Complication and Unmet Needs in Opioid-Induced Constipation. The companies have also asked pain doctors to show patients a chart about stool “health,” with diagrams to help assess shape and clumpiness. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a researcher at Georgetown University Medical Center who studies drug marketing, called the Movantik strategy “brilliant.” She compared it to other recent “disease awareness” campaigns focused on “premenstrual dysphoric disorder” (treatable with a new version of Prozac packaged in pink instead of blue) and “binge-eating disorder” (for which there is a new pill called Vyvanse). The OIC campaign created the perception of great need for the drug when the market should be “vanishingly small,” Fugh-Berman said — certainly not big enough to justify ads during the Super Bowl. “The best way to treat opioid-induced constipation,” she said, “is to prevent it in the first place by not overusing opioids.” Potential for good and bad Constipation is different for people on opioids. Opioids bind to a receptor that makes the gastrointestinal tract go awry, decreasing the secretion of fluids and inhibiting the muscle contractions that propel waste. As a result, stool gets “stuck.” While mostly a nuisance, the condition can be serious, especially among people already weakened by end-stage cancer. Some patients have been rushed to the emergency room to have the material removed from their bodies. In the early 1990s, Moss and his colleagues at the University of Chicago began working on a drug that would block what are known as mu opioid receptors, which are responsible for the side effect. The drug showed promise, and Moss was devastated when investors told him the potential profits were too small to be worth the risky investment. “If you’re a drug company, who wants to make a drug for people who weren’t going to be around in a couple of months? They wanted to aim for something people could take for 10, 20 years,” recalled Moss, who specializes in anesthesiology and critical care. The researchers decided to fund the work without industry help but ran into another roadblock: The FDA said it was too risky to continue testing the experimental drug on cancer patients. Regulators suggested a different population: opioid addicts being treated with methadone. Moss was reluctant. He considered the idea a detour that would slow down his work. “Our hearts really sank,” he said. Thinking that he had no choice, Moss began the testing, and the results were published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, in 2000. Pharmaceutical companies immediately came calling. Moss’s drug was picked up by a biotech company and, after changing hands a few times, eventually became Valeant’s Relistor. Nearly all the profits will go to the companies. The licensing deal through the University of Chicago calls for Moss and four colleagues to receive a modest initial payment in the thousands of dollars, plus a tiny slice of sales royalties. They also get “milestone payments” when the drug reaches a certain stage of approval or a certain market size. Parallel efforts took off at other companies. Nektar Therapeutics, a small San Francisco firm specializing in drug research and development, had been working on a drug known as NKTR-118, which was aimed at limiting opioid penetration of the central nervous system and reducing side effects such as dizziness and sleepiness. But researchers found that it also helped with constipation. In 2009, AstraZeneca bought the rights for the drug and recruited William Chey, director of the Gastrointestinal Physiology Laboratory at the University of Michigan, to help design and execute the first large-scale human study. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2014, were a crucial part of pushing Movantik over the FDA finish line. Last year, it became the first drug on the market specifically approved to treat opioid-induced constipation. Chey said that he has seen many patients with cancer and other serious illnesses suffering from the condition and that he believes Movantik can improve their quality of life. However, Chey said he also recognizes the concern that Movantik could enable chronic opioid use and worsen the nation’s epidemic of addiction. “I’ve thought a lot about the potential good and bad,” he said. “Used responsibly, this is an incredibly valuable drug.

"Last week, the acting chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration called medical marijuana ""a joke"" during a Q&A with reporters. Now, medical marijuana patients are calling for his head, with an online petition demanding his resignation attracting over 10,000 signatures on change.org. Here's what administrator Chuck Rosenberg said about medical marijuana, via CBS News: ""What really bothers me is the notion that marijuana is also medicinal -- because it's not,"" Rosenberg said in a briefing to reporters. ""We can have an intellectually honest debate about whether we should legalize something that is bad and dangerous, but don't call it medicine -- that is a joke."" [...] ""There are pieces of marijuana -- extracts or constituents or component parts -- that have great promise"" medicinally, he said. ""But if you talk about smoking the leaf of marijuana -- which is what people are talking about when they talk about medicinal marijuana -- it has never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine."" Rosenberg's argument that smoking marijuana ""has never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine"" has been contradicted by numerous studies. A meta-analysis of 79 medical marijuana studies involving 6,462 patients, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association earlier this year, found ""moderate-quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity."" There was low-quality evidence suggesting marijuana had therapeutic applications for other conditions as well. The finding that marijuana is effective at treating chronic pain is a big deal. High-caliber prescription painkillers are highly addictive and potentially deadly when misused -- they killed over 16,000 people via overdose in 2013, according to the CDC. Numerous studies have found that at the state level, the availability of medical marijuana is associated with a significant reduction of painkiller abuse rates and overdose deaths -- presumably, as patients opt to treat their pain with marijuana rather than painkillers. Rosenberg's statements about medical marijuana aren't surprising when you consider that they comport with the official position of the DEA. The Administration considers marijuana a ""Schedule 1"" controlled substance, which among other things means it has ""no currently accepted medical use."" Most researchers reject this claim, however, with organizations including Brookings Institution, the American Medical Association, and the ACLU arguing that the current designation is inappropriate. Given all this, marijuana advocates are furious at what they see as the DEA's dismissal of the science behind medical pot. ""My mom is a legal patient in Rhode Island, and she uses medical marijuana to deal with the severe pain she experiences from multiple sclerosis,"" said Tom Angell, chairman of the group Marijuana Majority, which started the petition. ""Medical cannabis is no joke to my family or the millions of other American families who have seen its real benefits."" In an e-mailed statement, a DEA spokesperson sought to clarify Rosenberg's remarks. ""To clarify, Acting Administrator Rosenberg indicated that marijuana should be subject to the same levels of approval and scrutiny as any other substance intended for use as a medicine. DEA supports efforts to research potential medical uses of marijuana. To this end, DEA has never denied a registration request from anyone conducting marijuana research using FDA approved protocols."" The spokesman added, ""acting Administrator Rosenberg was also clear to point out there are a number of marijuana components and/or extracts which appear to show promise as medicines, but have not yet been approved as safe and effective. His comments reflected the fact that FDA has not approved any medicinal uses for smoked marijuana."" This wouldn't be the first time Rosenberg has courted controversy over marijuana during his tenure as DEA administrator. Over the summer, he said that marijuana was ""probably not"" as dangerous as heroin, and then one week later clarified that ""heroin is clearly more dangerous than marijuana."" For the record, over 8,200 people died from heroin in 2013, compared to zero known marijuana overdose deaths. The previous DEA chief, Michele Leonhart, had a rocky relationship with the Obama administration as well -- especially when it came to drug policy issues, which she often criticized the administration on. Leonhart left her post under a cloud of scandal earlier this year, prompting cheers from drug policy reform advocates and hopes that her successor would change the DEA's tone on certain drug policy issues."	719	"[{""start"": 1156, ""end"": 1428, ""text"": ""A meta-analysis of 79 medical marijuana studies involving 6,462 patients, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association earlier this year, found \""moderate-quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity.\"""", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1620, ""end"": 1792, ""text"": ""High-caliber prescription painkillers are highly addictive and potentially deadly when misused -- they killed over 16,000 people via overdose in 2013, according to the CDC."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3499, ""end"": 3734, ""text"": ""The spokesman added, \""acting Administrator Rosenberg was also clear to point out there are a number of marijuana components and/or extracts which appear to show promise as medicines, but have not yet been approved as safe and effective"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3499, ""end"": 3734, ""text"": ""he spokesman added, \""acting Administrator Rosenberg was also clear to point out there are a number of marijuana components and/or extracts which appear to show promise as medicines, but have not yet been approved as safe and effective"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2678, ""end"": 3028, ""text"": ""My mom is a legal patient in Rhode Island, and she uses medical marijuana to deal with the severe pain she experiences from multiple sclerosis,\"" said Tom Angell, chairman of the group Marijuana Majority, which started the petition. \""Medical cannabis is no joke to my family or the millions of other American families who have seen its real benefits."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	696	2023-04-25T23:30:29.015125Z	2023-04-25T23:30:29.015231Z	367.768
The death last Sunday of ­Oscar-winning actor Philip ­Seymour Hoffman at age 46 ­focused media attention on the nationwide surge in heroin use and overdoses. But the very real heroin epidemic is framed by an even more dramatic increase since the beginning of the century in overdoses from pharmaceutical drugs known as opioids. These are, in effect, tandem epidemics — an addiction crisis driven by the powerful effects on the human brain of drugs derived from morphine. Prescription opioids are killing Americans at more than five times the rate that heroin is, according to the most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These drugs are sold under such familiar brand names as OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet and can be found in medicine cabinets in every precinct of American society. They’re also sold illicitly on the street or crushed and laced into heroin. There have been numerous efforts by law enforcement agencies to crack down on “pill mills” that dispense massive amounts of the pharmaceuticals, as well as regulations aimed at preventing users from “doctor shopping” to find someone who will write a prescription. Those efforts have had the unintended effect, officials say, of driving some people to heroin in recent years as their pill supply dries up. The latest government survey of drug abuse shows a drop since 2010 in first-time users of illegally obtained OxyContin. But heroin use is up. It’s akin to pushing on a beanbag chair. Health officials in Maryland, for example, reported that in the first seven months of 2012, a 15 percent drop in pharmaceutical opioid overdoses was accompanied by a 41 percent increase in heroin overdoses. Market forces play a role in this drug substitution, as do the brutal realities of addiction and the need for a fix. Street heroin is much cheaper than a pharmaceutical — typically $10 a packet for heroin, compared with perhaps $80 on the street for an 80 milligram OxyContin, public health officials say. The stigma and lethality of street heroin — long viewed much more negatively than drugs such as cocaine, according to government surveys — are no deterrent to someone facing the agony of withdrawal from an opioid. “In the storm of narcotic withdrawal, any opiate port will do,” said Jim Hall, an epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University in Florida who studies addiction. Prescription painkillers may also grease a slippery slope toward a relapse for former heroin addicts. Hoffman appears to be a case in point. He was found with a needle in his arm and dozens of heroin packets in his Manhattan apartment. The autopsy and initial toxicology tests were inconclusive, and so the precise cause of Hoffman’s death — whether he overdosed on heroin alone, for example, or in combination with one or more other drugs — is pending further investigation. But the actor revealed last year that, after being clean for two decades, he suffered a relapse into heroin use after first taking prescription pills. “The main driver of overdoses right now in our country is from opioid medications, more than from heroin,” said Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In 2010, according to the CDC, 3,036 people died in the United States from heroin overdoses, up from 1,960 in 1999. But 22,134 people died in 2010 from unintentional pharmaceutical drug overdoses, nearly triple the 7,523 deaths reported in 1999, according to the CDC. About three out of four of those overdoses — 16,652 — were from opioids. Most of the rest of the overdoses came from such drugs as Xanax, Valium and Ativan, which are used for anxiety or sleeplessness and are categorized scientifically as benzodiazepines. Most people who abuse pills don’t have legal prescriptions for them. They get them from family and friends, and sometimes from drug dealers. Young people may view them as safer than street drugs such as heroin because they are manufactured as medicine and originate with doctors. “We have tried to shatter the myth that these are safe,” Volkow said. Young people are often the victims of chemical combinations they don’t understand, said Karen Hacker, director of Pennsylvania’s Allegheny County Health Department, which includes the city of Pittsburgh. They combine pills with alcohol and other drugs. They may feel that snorting or smoking certain drugs is safer than injecting them. And they may not realize that slow-release opioid painkillers have long-lasting effects. “We had people going to sleep kind of drunk and literally not waking up in the morning,” Hacker said. Her county had a rash of 16 deaths between Jan. 17 and Jan. 30 from heroin laced with the opioid painkiller fentanyl, which is many times stronger than heroin. The chief medical examiner, Karl Williams, said that in the 1980s and 1990s, Allegheny County would typically have about 100 overdoses annually. But in the late ’90s, he said, the numbers began steadily rising, and now there are about 250 overdoses each year. Even that huge rate of overdoses didn’t prepare the coroner for what he saw on Friday, Jan. 17, when three bodies were brought in with signs of heroin overdoses. The next day, Saturday, he saw four more cases, and then Sunday brought three more — 10 deaths in three days. Laboratory tests showed that all had taken a lethal 50-50 mixture of heroin and fentanyl. The overdoses from the ­fentanyl-laced heroin apparently have stopped, Williams and Hacker said — presumably because word got to users that they were in grave peril from heroin sold in plastic envelopes stamped “Theraflu” and “Bud Ice.” “One of the challenges, of course, with this is that there are people who hear that there is some particularly strong heroin, and they would like some of it,” Hacker said. But, she added, “most users don’t want to die. They’re not looking to overdose. They’re not looking to commit suicide. They’re looking to get high.” Gil Kerlikowske, a former Seattle police chief who is director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said he is concerned that many young people simply don’t grasp how addictive heroin can be. “We see it in suburbs, among high school kids, and again it goes back to high school kids not being aware how dangerous it is. They think if they snort it or smoke it, they won’t become addicted — and within weeks they’ve become an injecting drug user,” Kerlikowske said. “This is really among the most debilitating of drug addictions that we historically know of,” said Hall, the Florida epidemiologist. “The heroin or opioid becomes the whole focus of the person’s life. Everything is centered on how are they going to take care of their need to have the opiate in their brain in the next 24 hours and what are they going to do to get that.” The White House is pushing more cities to follow the model of Quincy, Mass., where officers on patrol carry an anti-overdose medication called naloxone, which is sold under brand names such as Narcan. Lt. Patrick Glynn, commander of the Quincy police narcotics unit, said the program began after the city and neighboring jurisdictions had 99 overdose deaths in just 18 months in 2008 and 2009. “We realized we could not arrest our way out of this epidemic. Young people, middle-aged people were dropping on the street, overdosing on heroin,” Glynn said. In a recent three-year period, Glynn said, police administered 227 doses of nasal-spray Narcan and were able to reverse 216 of the overdoses.

With no end to the nation’s opioid crisis in sight, the federal government on Tuesday issued final recommendations that urge doctors to use more caution and consider alternatives before they prescribe highly addictive narcotic painkillers. This first national guidance on the subject is nonbinding, and doctors cannot be punished for failing to comply. But the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued the guidelines, said the effort was critical to bringing about “a culture shift for patients and doctors.” “We are waking up as a society to the fact that these are dangerous drugs,” Director Tom Frieden said in an interview. “Starting a patient on opiates is a momentous decision, and it should only be done if the patient and the doctor have a full understanding of the substantial risks involved.” After record numbers of overdose deaths from opioid painkillers and heroin, 2016 may prove to be the year that the federal government begins to forcefully address what has become a major public health crisis. In addition to the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration is reassessing its policies on opioid medications, the Senate has passed legislation that would expand drug abuse treatment and prevention, and the Drug Enforcement Administration is pushing physicians for more responsible prescribing. The departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense already have opioid policies for their patients. “For the first time, the federal government is communicating clearly that the widespread practice of prescribing opioids for chronic pain is inappropriate, that the risks outweigh the benefits,” said Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, a nonprofit that has been urging a curb on the use of opiates. Given the CDC’s influence in the medical community, its recommendations are “a game changer,” Kolodny said. Lawmakers who have faulted past federal efforts to tackle the addiction epidemic also welcomed the announcement. “I have pushed for the release of these guidelines because I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of prescription drug abuse on individuals, families, and communities,” said Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, which is one of the hardest-hit states. His statement called the guidelines “a critical part of our fight to end this epidemic.” Priscilla VanderVeer, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the organization has “long supported policies that will help combat this critical public health issue, while also ensuring access to these medicines for patients with legitimate medical needs.” Such policies include expanded provider education and training on pain management and access to treatment options, she said. Nearly 28,700 people died from overdoses of prescription opioids and heroin in 2014, according to the most recent data available. Since 1999, 165,000 people have fatally overdosed on prescription painkillers, the CDC said. In just the past month, it said, 4.3 million have diverted the drugs for nonmedical uses. “We know of no other medication routinely used for a nonfatal condition that kills patients so frequently,” Frieden and Debra Houry, director of the agency’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, wrote Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The guidelines, which were delayed a few months by disputes with drug industry groups, are aimed predominantly at primary care physicians. These doctors prescribe many of the opioids but complain that they have insufficient training in how to do so. Frieden agrees that many doctors need a refresher course on how to approach prescribing pain medications. “When I went to medical school I had exactly one lecture on pain, and the lecture said if you give an opioid to a patient in pain, they will not get addicted,” Frieden said. “Completely wrong, and yet a generation of doctors grew up being taught that.” The recommendations are not intended for doctors managing pain after cancer or surgery or during end-of-life care. [‘We can do more,’ FDA says in announcing overhaul of approach to opioid painkillers] The CDC recommends that patients seeking help for pain first try non-opioid medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen whenever possible, as well as exercise and weight loss. If opioids are prescribed, low doses and less than a week’s supply should be provided. Currently, many doctors write prescriptions for oxycodone, hydrocodone and others to last patients several weeks or even a month. “Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed,” the guidelines state. The CDC advises clinicians to conduct urine tests of patients before starting opioid therapy and to test patients’ urine for the presence of controlled substances and illicit drugs at least annually. Not many years ago, doctors were sometimes criticized for undertreating pain. But in 2012, after years of aggressive marketing by some drug companies, health-care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers — enough for every adult in the country to have a bottle of pills. Many patients now ask to be treated with opioids, Frieden said, and doctors who are worried about receiving low patient-satisfaction ratings often give in. CDC officials stressed that in many cases, opioid drugs do a poorer job than other therapies in lessening pain. The agency is encouraging patients to question doctors who prescribe opioids for chronic pain. Opioids “carry substantial risks but only uncertain benefits,” Frieden said. “The risks will outweigh the benefits for the vast majority of patients.” Only about 5 percent of patients being prescribed opioid painkillers are receiving them for chronic pain. But that small group accounts for nearly three-quarters of opioid prescriptions. More than 70 percent of patients who die of opioid-related overdoses became addicted while being treated for chronic pain. The recommendations also encourage doctors to monitor the effectiveness of the drugs they prescribe, to be on the lookout for dangerous drug interactions and to routinely check in with patients to make sure they aren’t abusing addictive prescription drugs or other illicit drugs. Frieden said he expects that states and health insurers will incorporate some of the recommendations into their programs to help improve patient safety.    	717	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 51, ""text"": ""th no end to the nation’s opioid crisis in sight,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 538, ""end"": 830, ""text"": ""We are waking up as a society to the fact that these are dangerous drugs,” Director Tom Frieden said in an interview. “Starting a patient on opiates is a momentous decision, and it should only be done if the patient and the doctor have a full understanding of the substantial risks involved."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 831, ""end"": 1038, ""text"": ""After record numbers of overdose deaths from opioid painkillers and heroin, 2016 may prove to be the year that the federal government begins to forcefully address what has become a major public health crisis"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1431, ""end"": 1776, ""text"": ""or the first time, the federal government is communicating clearly that the widespread practice of prescribing opioids for chronic pain is inappropriate, that the risks outweigh the benefits,” said Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, a nonprofit that has been urging a curb on the use of opiates"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2777, ""end"": 2906, ""text"": ""early 28,700 people died from overdoses of prescription opioids and heroin in 2014, according to the most recent data available."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2907, ""end"": 3351, ""text"": ""Since 1999, 165,000 people have fatally overdosed on prescription painkillers, the CDC said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to explore the use of medical marijuana as an alternative to the powerful opioid painkillers that kill thousands of people each year. In a letter to CDC chief Tom Friedan, the Massachusetts Democrat also asks the agency to look into “the impact of the legalization of medical and recreational marijuana on opioid overdose deaths.” From a public health standpoint, Warren is right. There is a lot of potential here. Here’s a rundown of what the research has shown so far: Marijuana is effective at treating pain A big meta-analysis of 79 studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association found solid evidence that marijuana is effective at treating chronic pain. The researchers noted “30% or greater improvement in pain with cannabinoid compared with placebo.” Marijuana is safe when used to treat pain A Canadian study published last year in the journal Pain found no evidence of serious side effects among medical marijuana users after a year of treatment. Users did report some incidence of “non-serious” side effects, such as coughing and dizziness, however. Medical marijuana users are less likely to drink or take other painkillers Research published last year in the journal Drug and Alcohol Review found that 80 percent of medical marijuana users reported substituting pot for painkillers, and 52 percent said they drank less when taking medical marijuana. “The high rate of substitution for prescribed substances, particularly among patients with pain-related conditions, suggests that further research into cannabis/cannabinoids as a potentially safer substitute for or adjunct to opiates is justified,” the researchers concluded. States with medical marijuana laws have fewer painkiller overdose deaths In 2014, a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that states with medical marijuana laws saw a 24.8 percent reduction in opioid overdose deaths, compared with states without such laws. That worked out to about 1,700 fewer deaths in 2010 alone. Medical marijuana availability decreases the rate of opioid dependency and death  An NBER working paper published last year found that the presence of marijuana dispensaries was associated with a 15 percent to 35 percent decrease in substance abuse admissions and a similar drop in opiate overdose deaths. “Our findings suggest that providing broader access to medical marijuana may have the potential benefit of reducing abuse of highly addictive painkillers,” the researchers concluded. One important thing to note: All of the studies above were published in the past 18 months or so. This is a fairly new angle of inquiry, and the results suggest it is a highly promising one. The CDC could play a leading role in fostering more of this type of research in the future, and the need for it is critical: Nearly 20,000 people died from prescription opiate overdoses in 2014, according to the CDC.

New federal rules that make it harder to get narcotic painkillers are taking an unexpected toll on thousands of veterans who depend on these prescription drugs to treat a wide variety of ailments, such as missing limbs and post-traumatic stress. The restrictions, adopted last summer by the Drug Enforcement Administration to curb a national epidemic of opioid abuse, are for the first time, in effect, forcing veterans to return to the doctor every month to renew their medication, although many were already struggling to get appointments at overburdened VA health facilities. And even if patients can get appointments, the new rules pose an additional hardship for many who live a good distance from the health centers. Although the tighter regulation applies to everyone on opioid painkillers, it’s hitting veterans especially hard because so many are being treated for horrific injuries sustained during the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and have become dependent on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ beleaguered health-care system for medical care. The rules come at a time of turmoil for VA. The agency’s widespread problem with patient backlogs burst into view last year with revelations that employees had covered up how long veterans had to wait for care, even for such pressing matters as cancer and suicide prevention. [How the VA developed its culture of cover-ups] In dramatically curtailing access to the highly addictive painkillers, the government is trying to roll back what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has termed “the worst drug addiction epidemic in the country’s history, killing more people than heroin and crack cocaine.” The rules apply to “hydrocodone combination products,” such as Vicodin. More than half a million veterans are now on prescription opioids, according to VA. Pain experts at VA say that in hindsight they have been overmedicating veterans, and doctors at the Pentagon and VA now say that the use of the painkillers contributes to family strife, homelessness and even suicide among veterans. A study by the American Public Health Association in 2011 also showed that the overdose rate among VA patients is nearly double the national average. But some veterans say they have come to depend on these painkillers to function and now, unable to get a timely renewal of the prescription, are suffering withdrawal symptoms that feel like a panic attack and the flu at the same time. Craig Schroeder was injured in a makeshift-bomb explosion while serving as a Marine corporal in the “Triangle of Death,” a region south of Baghdad. He suffers from traumatic brain injury, which has affected his hearing, memory and movement, and from pain related to a broken foot and ankle and a herniated disc in his back. He has been on a steady regimen of opioids. But after the DEA regulations were put in place, he was unable to get an appointment to see his doctor for nearly five months, he said. He stayed in bed at his home in North Carolina much of that time. “It was a nightmare. I was just in unbearable, terrible pain,” he said. “I couldn’t even go to the ER because those doctors won’t write those scripts.” His wife, Stephanie Schroeder, said getting him a VA appointment turned into a part-time job and her “main mission in life.” While part of the problem was a shortage of doctors, she said she also noticed that VA had become hostile toward patients who asked for painkillers. “Suddenly, the VA treats people on pain meds like the new lepers,” she said. “It feels like they told us for years to take these drugs, didn’t offer us any other ideas, and now we’re suddenly demonized, second-class citizens.” Officials at Disabled American Veterans, a veterans service organization, said VA needs to be more compassionate and help veterans through the changes. “We’re hearing from veterans with lifelong disabilities, who never had a problem with addiction issues. They have been on these drugs for decades, and then all of a sudden it was boom, a total change in attitudes,” said Joy Ilem, the group’s deputy national legislative director. Gavin West, a clinical operations chief at VA, said there has been a systematic effort since autumn to contact veterans to explain the new rules, broader concerns about opioid use and alternative options for treatment. At the same time, he said, the agency is working to ensure that veterans get the access to medical care that’s required. “The DEA did a good thing here for opioid safety,” he said. But he added, “How do you balance the sensitivity of patients and the new rules when all of a sudden a veteran, who’s been treated with this medication for 15 years or 20 years, has everything change?” To help patients adjust to the changes, Rollin Gallagher, VA’s national director for pain management, said staff members are meeting personally with veterans. “There is the real anxiety of being in pain and losing control of that pain. We are aware of the fact that we need to pay attention to this,” he said. The agency recently set up a Choice Card program for veterans, which would allow those facing long wait lists or who live more than 40 miles away from a VA hospital to use private clinic visits. Veterans say the initiative is complicated and confusing. VA officials acknowledged this month that veterans have been using this program at a lower rate than anticipated. [Veterans say new choice cards are causing more problems] DEA officials declined to comment on the specific challenges that the new rules pose for veterans. Barbara L. Carreno, a DEA spokeswoman, said in a statement that everyone, including “practitioners employed by the U.S. Veterans Administration,” have to follow the new regulations. The officials said the rules are a response to multiple medical studies that have showed that the opioid overdose rate is higher in the United States than anywhere else. DEA officials offer some flexibility, allowing doctors to write prescriptions for up to 90 days by post-dating them. But many VA doctors will not do that because of concerns over fraud or fatal overdoses; doctors are telling patients they need to come back every month, medical staff say. Half of all returning troops suffer chronic pain, according to a study in the June issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. So a new generation of pain doctors is pushing for alternative ways to help veterans cope with chronic pain. Some alternatives are acupuncture, bright light therapy and medical marijuana. As part of a $21.7 million initiative with the National Institutes of Health, VA is looking for therapies that could substitute for opioids. “Our hospitals are doing some really exciting things to combat chronic pain and take care of our veterans. There are VA hospitals that are using alpha-stimulation devices to treat pain and depression,” VA Secretary Robert McDonald said. “That’s only going to continue and keep getting better. And we are getting there.” [Federal research seeks alternatives to addictive opioids for veterans in pain] In the meantime, however, veterans say they continue to bear the burden of the new restrictions on narcotic painkillers. A retired staff Army sergeant who served in Iraq, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for medical privacy reasons, said he can’t drive because of shrapnel in his femur and pelvis. He takes the bus nearly two hours for “a one-minute consult” to get his medications. He has been taking them for more than nine years and has never had an addiction problem, he said. Mike Davis, a retired Army corporal, said he shattered his left arm from the elbow to the fingertips when he fell off of a Pershing missile during maneuvers in Germany in 1979. Over the years, he has had six surgeries. After the last one, in 2003, he was prescribed opioids and said he has been on them since. Davis, who now works as a social worker in Illinois, said he feels lucky to have found a combination of painkillers that works for him. “It’s just insulting to the veteran to assume they are abusing these drugs,” said his wife, Linda Davis, who works as his personal patient advocate. “I’m fully aware that people doctor-shop, some docs overprescribe. But I think they need to realize that there’s a real difference between addiction and dependence.” But Andrew Kolodny, president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, called the new DEA rules “the single most important change that could happen. The best way to treat any disease, whether it’s Ebola or opioid addiction, is to stop creating more people with the disease.” At the same time, he said, VA needs to do far more to help veterans through the rocky transition. “Unfortunately, veterans are the victims here,” Kolodny said. “The VA created this mess by aggressively jumping onto pills as the solution. But it’s not something you can just abruptly stop.” The Washington Post has created a Facebook community for veterans to share their experiences.

Tuesday was a banner night for medical marijuana — with ballot initiatives in numerous states widening access to the substance for Americans seeking relief from pain or a treatment for illness. Massachusetts and California, where Napster co-founder and cancer philanthropist Sean Parker helped fund a campaign to legalize the drug, were among the states passing new recreational marijuana laws. The tide also turned in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas — where similar measures were defeated in the past — and in Montana where measures regarding medical marijuana were passed. Before this week, medical marijuana was legal in a little over half the country or 25 states. The wins come as rigorous scientific evidence is mounting that marijuana or its components may have beneficial medical effects. Earlier this year, GW Pharmaceuticals said that clinical trials show a cannabis-derived drug may be able to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy. Physicians are also increasingly looking to marijuana as an alternative to highly addictive opioids that have led to a crisis in overdoses. This chart, from my colleague Christopher Ingraham, shows just how dramatic the difference in the painkiller prescriptions is in medical-marijuana states vs. non-medical-marijuana states. Here's a closer look at the medical marijuana measures passed Tuesday night: Florida: A similar measure was narrowly defeated two years ago. This time, voters cast their ballots overwhelmingly in favor of a full-scale medical marijuana program. The new amendment states that patients with illnesses of the “same kind or class as or comparable to” serious illnesses, such as cancer, HIV, post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy would be eligible to access medical marijuana. Some 450,000 residents would qualify, according to The News-Press in Fort Myers. The state already had laws on the books that allowed the use of marijuana for the terminally ill and of a cannabis-derived drug for epilepsy. North Dakota: According to the Bismark Tribune, “The measure will allow people to possess up to 3 ounces of medical marijuana for treatment of up to nearly a dozen medical conditions. Facilities for medical marijuana distribution will be licensed by the state Health Department and operated by nonprofit organizations.” Montana: The Independent Record in Helena reported that the measure means that “providers of the drug will not be limited to the number of patients they can serve:” “The previous restriction imposed a limit of three, which was sharply opposed by patients and providers in the program. Most medical marijuana patients were left without a registered provider under the restrictions. Since they went into effect, patients have left the program. More than a third of patients registered in September left over the next month — 7,785 remained in October, according to the state health department. “I-182 adds post-traumatic stress disorder to the list of eligible conditions, allows for lab testing for marijuana and orders annual health department inspections of providers.” Arkansas: The measure allows people who have any of 18 qualifying conditions — such as cancer, glaucoma, Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C — to access dispensaries. According to the Associated Press and KTHV, “some political leaders said they preferred that Arkansas legislators instead allow a version of the drug that is low in THC, which gives marijuana its high.” Marijuana wins big on election night Cannabis-derived drug shows promise for kids with epilepsy; GW pharma stock doubles One striking chart shows why pharma companies are fighting legal marijuana	712	"[{""start"": 131, ""end"": 192, ""text"": ""Americans seeking relief from pain or a treatment for illness"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 800, ""end"": 992, ""text"": ""arlier this year, GW Pharmaceuticals said that clinical trials show a cannabis-derived drug may be able to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3526, ""end"": 3622, ""text"": ""ijuana wins big on election night Cannabis-derived drug shows promise for kids with epilepsy;"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1463, ""end"": 1565, ""text"": ""This time, voters cast their ballots overwhelmingly in favor of a full-scale medical marijuana program"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2093, ""end"": 2227, ""text"": ""The measure will allow people to possess up to 3 ounces of medical marijuana for treatment of up to nearly a dozen medical conditions."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2228, ""end"": 2363, ""text"": ""Facilities for medical marijuana distribution will be licensed by the state Health Department and operated by nonprofit organizations.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	689	2023-04-25T12:31:38.671393Z	2023-04-25T12:31:38.671498Z	0.634
BURLINGTON, Vt. — Addiction to prescription painkillers and heroin has grown so deadly that the Obama administration wants to spend more than $1 billion over the next two years fighting it. Nearly all of the money would go to making anti-addiction medications, including buprenorphine, more available. Yet in the midst of the worst epidemic of unintentional drug overdose in U.S. history — mortality rates are four to fives times as high as in the mid-1970s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — it can be harder to get drugs to treat an addiction than it is to get the drugs that feed it. More than 28,000 Americans died from heroin and painkiller overdoses in 2014, according to the CDC. But fewer than half of the 2.2 million people who need treatment for opioid addiction are receiving it, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said as President Obama’s latest budget was released last month. Peter Shumlin (D-Vt.) was among the first governors to address the opioid epidemic, devoting his entire State of the State address to the crisis in 2014. Since then, his administration and many of Vermont’s private-practice doctors have made treatment more available than it is in most of the country. Despite that, almost 500 addicts in this state of 626,000 people are on waiting lists to receive medication for opioid dependence. More than half will wait close to a year. Nationwide, a shortage of doctors willing to prescribe buprenorphine, which reduces drug cravings, and a federal limit on the number of patients each doctor can treat, prevents many who could benefit from the medication from getting it. Where are the doctors? Nearly every U.S. physician — there are more than 900,000 of them — can write prescriptions for opioid painkillers such as OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin by simply signing on to a federal registry. In most states, nurse practitioners and physician assistants can also prescribe opioids. But to prescribe buprenorphine to people addicted to opioids and heroin, doctors must take an eight-hour course and apply for a special license. So far, fewer than 32,000 doctors have received the license, and the vast majority who have one seldom if ever use it. Vermont has 248 doctors licensed to prescribe buprenorphine to addicts, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS. Few of them accept new patients who are addicted to opioids. In the weeks ahead, HHS is expected to propose a change that would probably increase the number of patients a doctor can treat with buprenorphine, possibly with the addition of new licensing requirements. But many who work in the field of addiction question whether allowing the specially licensed doctors to treat more addicts would do much good. As in Vermont, very few doctors across the country come anywhere close to maxing out on the number of such patients they are allowed to have. The solution, they say, is for more doctors to prescribe the medication. But that’s a long-term solution that involves teaching newly minted doctors about addiction during their residencies and trying to change the hearts and minds of physicians already in private practice, said John Brooklyn, the medical director at the Howard Center, an opioid treatment program in Vermont’s Chittenden County. “We’re making progress,” he said. “But it will take time.” Advocates for greater access to buprenorphine also support a bipartisan bill in Congress — the Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act, or TREAT — that would allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe it. Without legislation, HHS has authority only to adjust the patient limit and licensing rules for physicians. Melinda Campopiano, chief medical officer at HHS’s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, agreed that patients with opioid addiction would be better served if more doctors offered addiction screening and treatment. “What is a concern to me is that more physicians don’t feel the responsibility to step up” and get a license to provide buprenorphine, she said. An untapped resource When approved in 2002, buprenorphine was the first opioid-addiction medication that could be prescribed by doctors. The only alternative at the time was methadone, which had to be dispensed daily at highly regulated clinics. (A third addiction medication, Vivitrol, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010, but it is expensive and not widely used for opioid addiction in much of the country.) Although buprenorphine does not produce the euphoric effects of heroin or OxyContin, many drug users purchase it on the street to tide themselves over until they can score the real thing. Clinical research shows that all three opioid-addiction medicines offer a far greater chance of recovery than treatments that do not involve medication, such as 12-step programs and residential care. Staying in recovery and avoiding relapse for at least a year is more than twice as likely with medications as without them. Medications also lower the risk of a fatal overdose. Buprenorphine was developed with the idea that family doctors could assess patients with an opioid addiction to make sure the daily oral medication was appropriate and prescribe a monthly supply to be picked up at a drugstore. Like methadone, buprenorphine is a long-acting opioid that relieves drug cravings and physical withdrawal symptoms with fewer of the side effects of other opioids. It presents a very low risk of overdose unless taken in combination with benzodiazepines such as Valium and Xanax. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, which funded buprenorphine’s development, has urged doctors everywhere to start prescribing it to their patients with opioid addiction. That way, people who respond well would no longer have to travel to a methadone clinic every morning. They could get help the same way people with other diseases do — at their local doctor’s office. So far, that hasn’t happened. In anticipation of buprenorphine’s approval by the FDA, a 2000 federal law required doctors to seek a special license from the Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe it. Without that law, a 1914 federal narcotics law would have precluded doctors from prescribing the drug, and it would have been subject to the same kind of regulation as methadone. Because buprenorphine is much safer than methadone, Congress wanted to make sure patients didn’t have to disrupt their lives by traveling to one of only 1,200 methadone clinics scattered across the country to take the daily medication under strict supervision. In addition to requiring training, the buprenorphine law limited licensed doctors to 30 patients in the first year and 100 patients in subsequent years. The restriction was meant to discourage what are called pill mills, in which doctors prescribe addiction medications for a cash fee without ensuring that patients are actually using it to recover and not selling it on the street. Addiction prejudice? Since then, the law has been criticized for contributing to a shortage of prescribers and unfairly singling out addicts and the doctors who treat them. No other medication requires a special license, and no other disease is subject to a patient limit, argued Kelly J. Clark, president-elect of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. She said the rules are symptomatic of the nation’s long-standing prejudice against the disease of addiction. But others argue that the rules are warranted to keep buprenorphine off the streets and to ensure quality treatment. “Treating opioid addiction with medications has to be more than just medication management,” said Mark Parrino, president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, which represents methadone clinic operators. If buprenorphine were deregulated, Parrino says there would be no guarantee that patients would get the counseling and regular urine tests that major medical associations agree they should have. Under current rules, the DEA routinely audits physicians to make sure they are keeping records as required and providing adequate treatment. Here in Burlington, Tom Dalton, director of a publicly funded needle exchange center, agrees that buprenorphine coupled with counseling is ideal. But if that’s not available, he said, “we should at least give them a prescription.” When people make the decision to get clean, they should be able to get into treatment immediately. Otherwise, there’s a good chance they will disappear, die of an overdose or get arrested, Dalton said. At a minimum, their addiction will escalate, he said. Many who are smoking or snorting opioids start injecting, which spreads diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. In October, the average wait time to get into the opioid treatment program in Chittenden County was 358 days. But because the waiting list includes pregnant women who by federal law must be treated within 48 hours and intravenous drug users, who must be treated within 14 days, the wait is much longer for everyone else. — Stateline	711	"[{""start"": 615, ""end"": 714, ""text"": ""More than 28,000 Americans died from heroin and painkiller overdoses in 2014, according to the CDC."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	688	2023-04-25T12:15:15.862145Z	2023-04-25T12:15:15.862245Z	466.686
