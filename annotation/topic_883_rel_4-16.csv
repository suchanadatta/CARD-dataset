"An airplane has flown across the United States, powered only by sunlight. The impressive feat was made possible by improvements in solar cell and battery technology. This chart, produced by the Department of Energy, shows how solar technology has improved: The efficiency is the fraction of captured solar energy that is converted into electrical power. The Web site for the plane, named Solar Impulse, reports that the vessel was powered by monocrystalline silicon solar cells, represented by blue squares on the chart. Interestingly, this is not the most energy-efficient category of solar cells. However, Solar Impulse's designers were less concerned with absolute efficiency than they were with the ratio of efficiency to weight. The lighter the solar cells, the farther the plane could fly on each kWH of energy. Because the flight across the United States took more than 24 hours (specifically, about 2 months), the plane needed to collect energy during the day and then use it at night. It used lightweight lithium polymer batteries to do this. The Solar Impulse team says the ""total efficiency of the propulsion train""—counting power lost by the solar cells, the batteries and other components—was about 12 percent. Solar-powered airplanes won't replace traditional airplanes any time soon. Airplanes powered by traditional jet fuel fly much faster and can carry much heavier loads. But the flight across the United States was an impressive feat of engineering. And the Solar Impulse team now has its sights on an even bigger goal: flying around the world on solar power."	475	26	483	2023-04-05T12:53:20.450739Z	2023-04-05T12:53:20.450992Z	943.883	"[{""start"": 521, ""end"": 732, ""text"": ""Interestingly, this is not the most energy-efficient category of solar cells.

Solar Impulse 2, an airplane powered only by the sun, completed its round-the-world flight early Tuesday by landing in Abu Dhabi, covering more than 27,000 miles in 550-plus hours in the sky. Bertrand Piccard piloted the final flight, a turbulent two-day ride from Egypt to the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Piccard, who is 58, and André Borschberg, 63, took turns in the airplane for the 16 other flights in the single-seater, which has the wingspan of a 747 jumbo jet but weighs only as much as a car. The trip began in March 2015 with early stops in India, China and Japan. While heading from Japan to Hawaii, Borschberg was at the controls for four days, 21 hours, 52 minutes — a world record for the longest flight with only one pilot onboard. That flight was Borshberg’s most challenging, he said by phone from Abu Dhabi. “It was the first time we could and had to fly many days and many nights over the ocean. It was what I call the moment of truth,” Borschberg said. “The tension was in­cred­ibly high. . . . When I left Japan, I had technical difficulties. The engineers wanted me to go back.” Borschberg said he was convinced that he could succeed despite the equipment problems. Pilot and plane arrived safely in Hawaii last July, but the batteries overheated and needed replacing. The problem caused a nine-month delay in the trip. New batteries allowed the journey to resume in April. Stops in the United States included San Francisco, California; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Dayton, Ohio, the childhood home town of aviation pioneers Wilbur and Orville Wright. At several of the layovers, the public was invited to see the plane. Borschberg said he enjoyed the kids’ reaction. “So many classes of kids, when they see the airplane you see the eyes get bright,” he said. Borschberg said he hopes Solar Impulse 2 will inspire children around the globe. “They can develop better solutions, clean solutions,” he said. “We have showed the way that we can go, but there is so much potential.” That potential includes aircraft powered by electricity — something Borschberg said should be developed in the near future. But as he and Piccard continue to spread the message of using clean technology (or using renewable resources) in the air and on the ground, Borschberg is hoping the sun will play a significant role. “There’s something that is truly special about solar power,” he said.	468	26	476	2023-04-05T12:22:49.935785Z	2023-04-05T12:22:49.935955Z	709.889	"[{""start"": 315, ""end"": 434, ""text"": ""Piccard, who is 58, and André Borschberg, 63, took turns in the airplane for the 16 other flights in the single-seater,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 584, ""end"": 833, ""text"": ""While heading from Japan to Hawaii, Borschberg was at the controls for four days, 21 hours, 52 minutes — a world record for the longest flight with only one pilot onboard.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the amount of propane Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones had on board when they started their round-the-world hot air balloon flight in 1999. It was 8,200 pounds of propane, not 8,200 tons. This version has been corrected. MOFFETT FEDERAL AIRFIELD, Calif. — The first plane that can fly day and night powered only by the sun on Friday began a transcontinental journey that will reach Washington by mid-June. Solar Impulse, which lifted off from this World War II-era airfield shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific time, has room for only one person and an average cruising speed of about 43 miles per hour. But its Swiss developers say the technology suggests the possibilities of clean-energy flight. The plane has an ultra-light carbon-fiber frame that allows it to weigh 3,500 pounds — about the same as a mid-size car. It has the wingspan of a 747 and a slender fuselage, giving it the look of a giant high-tech dragonfly. The plane’s power is drawn from the sun by 12,000 photovoltaic cells that form the top of its wings. The juice is collected in a series of batteries arrayed behind the craft’s four electric engines. It routinely reaches altitudes of up to 28,000 feet, about a mile below the thin air traversed by big commercial airliners zipping around at close to 500 miles per hour. On-board instruments alert the pilot if the plane banks even a degree too far. For all of its innovations, at this stage of development, Solar Impulse is no more practical for commercial flight than was the single-engine Spirit of St. Louis that Charles Lindbergh piloted across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. The plane’s engines put out about 10 horsepower — roughly the same amount of power as the Wright brothers’ first planes. Solar Impulse cannot take off or land in windy conditions, nor can it fly through clouds. The lone pilot wears a parachute and is confined to an area the size of a “bad economy seat,” noted the project’s chief executive and co-founder Andre Borschberg, 60, an engineer and former fighter pilot. The tiny cockpit is unheated and unpressurized, meaning the pilot must endure extreme heat and cold and wear an oxygen mask. On long flights, Borschberg practices meditation and advanced breathing techniques to stay energized. His co-founder and the plane’s other pilot, Bertrand Piccard, a psychiatrist, does self-hypnosis. And as for bodily functions — the pilot relies on spent water bottles and eschews fibrous foods in the days before a flight to make sure that diapers do not have to be pressed into service. But comfort is not the project’s goal. “The point of this is to underscore how far we’ve come and how far we need to go to develop alternative sources of power, particularly solar energy,” said Bob van der Linden, chairman of the aeronautics department at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. “This will help push the technology along.” He said there are some possible applications raised by Solar Impulse’s innovations, including high- and long-flying unmanned planes that could be used for mapping purposes. But any broad commercial uses, he said, lie beyond the horizon. None of this dims the enthusiasm of the project’s founders. The idea to build the plane started with Piccard, 55, a hang-gliding pioneer, who earned international acclaim in 1999 when he and co-pilot Brian Jones won a competition to fly around the world non-stop in a hot air balloon. Although they won, Piccard was struck that while they started the trip with 8,200 pounds of propane, they had only 88 pounds remaining when the balloon landed. That steeled his determination to again circle the globe but this time without consuming any fossil fuels. “For me, it was obvious that an airplane that could fly around the world without fuel was the next big adventure of the 21st century,” Piccard said. He took his idea to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, which initiated a feasibility study headed by Borschberg. Design of the plane began in 2003, with Borschberg and Piccard assembling a team of 80 partners — which includes racing yacht maker Decision, the precision instruments firm Omega and the Bayer materials company — to build it after traditional airplane manufacturers told them it was impossible. In all, the project has cost more than $140 million. The plane has performed well. Borschberg piloted the first solar-powered night flight in 2010, spending 26 consecutive hours over Switzerland. In 2011, it flew from Switzerland to Belgium and then on to France, where it was a showpiece at the Paris-Bourget International Air Show. And last summer, the plane crossed the Mediterranean from Spain to Morocco. After being transported to this California airfield aboard a 747 cargo plane, Solar Impulse has soared over the Golden Gate Bridge, raising curiosity across the Bay Area and drawing several thousand visitors to its temporary home inside a cavernous hangar that a couple of generations ago housed military dirigibles. The plane will make five stops on its flight across the United States, spending up to a couple of weeks in each city it visits: Phoenix, Dallas, St. Louis and Washington, where it is slated to land at Dulles International Airport. From there, it is on to New York. The U.S. tour is a prelude for a planned around-the-world flight in 2015. That journey will be taken by a second-generation solar plane, with accoutrements necessary for long-haul flights, including automatic pilot, a more ergonomic cockpit and a toilet beneath the pilot’s seat. That vessel should be ready for testing next year. Although even Piccard and Borschberg do not expect to see development of a more practical solar-powered plane anytime soon, they are confident that some of the lessons from Solar Impulse — the use of lighter materials, more gradual descents to airports and more direct routes to destinations — can help make aviation more energy-efficient in the short run. In the long run, they added, anything is possible. “I think people have a tendency to forget [the limited capabilities of] the airplane of the Wright brothers. How was the airplane of Charles Lindbergh? How was the first one of Chuck Yeager? All these airplanes, they were very limited,” Piccard said. “They were just the maximum of what could be done in those days. So the people who criticize Solar Impulse are like those who looked at the Wright Brothers and said, ‘This has no future.’ ”	466	26	474	2023-04-05T12:04:58.828205Z	2023-04-05T12:04:58.828276Z	821.557	"[{""start"": 461, ""end"": 650, ""text"": ""Solar Impulse, which lifted off from this World War II-era airfield shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific time, has room for only one person and an average cruising speed of about 43 miles per hour."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1447, ""end"": 1645, ""text"": ""at this stage of development, Solar Impulse is no more practical for commercial flight than was the single-engine Spirit of St. Louis that Charles Lindbergh piloted across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1768, ""end"": 1857, ""text"": ""Solar Impulse cannot take off or land in windy conditions, nor can it fly through clouds."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1858, ""end"": 1951, ""text"": ""The lone pilot wears a parachute and is confined to an area the size of a “bad economy seat,”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2063, ""end"": 2186, ""text"": ""The tiny cockpit is unheated and unpressurized, meaning the pilot must endure extreme heat and cold and wear an oxygen mask"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1647, ""end"": 1767, ""text"": ""The plane’s engines put out about 10 horsepower — roughly the same amount of power as the Wright brothers’ first planes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2188, ""end"": 2576, ""text"": ""On long flights, Borschberg practices meditation and advanced breathing techniques to stay energized.

Summer is upon us, and with it peak U.S. airline travel: this July, more than 80 million passengers will cross American skies. But what’s good for vacation relaxation is terrible for the environment. According to the WWF, airline travel is the fastest growing source of global greenhouse gas emissions, leaving trucking and coal-burning power plants in their wake. Already, the 3 billion flights each year produce about 5 percent of the world’s output from all sources.  Every round-trip commercial flight between New York and L.A. generates the equivalent of two tons of carbon dioxide per passenger, as much as the average Nepalese family generates in five years. A Prius would have to travel 10,500 miles to have the same carbon impact. Yet even those who want, urgently, to fight global warming have been slow to deal with the impact of air travel. (Think of those high-profile do-gooders who flew 550 private jets to confab at Davos about carbon dioxide levels in January. The Environmental Protection Agency only just declared that air travel contributes to global warming and that it will begin regulating greenhouse emissions by carriers under the Clean Air Act. Why, when car travel is perennially in the hot seat, has this issue gotten so little attention? We’ve got electric cars, smaller cars, cars with great gas mileage. Why haven’t we seen the same technological evolution with planes? The answer is that airplanes pose a fundamentally different engineering problem. They have to do work to carry their fuel through the air, so are limited by the energy density of the storage medium. Increasing efficiency of aircraft engines and wings will help, but only to a point. And a lot of the “easy” fixes have been made. Companies like Boeing and Airbus have been working for five decades to build planes that burn less fuel, innovating materials and making computer-aided tweaks to aerodynamic design. They’ve increased use of strong, lightweight materials like carbon fiber laminates that now make up more than 50 percent of a modern passenger jet’s airframe. They also developed sophisticated turbofan engines that are significantly more efficient than older models. Their newest aircraft (released in 2000) use half as much fuel per mile as the jets of a half-century ago (Cars and SUVs are about 40 percent more efficient today.) And engineers say there are few fixes left. “The present technology is already highly optimized,” says writer and aircraft designer Peter Garrison. “The low-hanging fruit has been plucked.” An alternative idea would be to write off conventional technology as a dead-end, and instead invest in radical approaches like solar-powered aircraft. The topic has been in the news lately, thanks to the photovoltaic-encrusted experimental plane Solar Impulse. The plane, currently in Japan, is part of a 12-year project by Swiss adventurers Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg, who want to fly around the world. If successful, the plane is expected to return to its starting point in Abu Dhabi in August. If you squint, it’s easy to see in Solar Impulse the dawn of the eco-friendly airliner. With four engines and wings as broad as a 747’s, it physically resembles a commercial aircraft. But appearances deceive. To achieve its long-distance flights, Sunseeker not only uses advanced materials and design techniques, it also relies on extreme design choices. It is extremely light: At just 5,000 pounds, the 70-foot-long aircraft weighs less than a Chevy Avalanche. A fully laden 737,  on the small side for a commercial jet, weighs about 150,000 lb or 30 times more than Solar Impulse. In order to carry the additional weight of passengers and their baggage, a commercial airliner built using the same technology would have to be impractically enormous. It would also be bare of all familiar amenities. To save energy, Solar Impulse is neither pressurized nor climate controlled, so that temperatures in the tiny cockpit swing between 86 F and -4 F. And it is slow. Solar Impulse cruises at a languid 56 mph, about one-tenth the speed of a typical commercial jet. The reason is simple aerodynamics. As it flies, a plane disrupts the air it moves through, and this takes power. The faster it goes, the more power it will consume. Very efficient airplanes, like gliders or human-powered airplanes, have long, thin wings designed to move slowly through the air. That’s appealing for aeronautical engineers, but not to travelers on tight schedules. To get from Hawaii to Arizona for the eighth stage of its round-the-world journey Solar Impulse will require more than four days of continuous flight. Really, the only way for commercial aviation to become green would be for science to come up with a storage medium that’s as energy dense as fossil fuel, but that doesn’t release net carbon into the atmosphere. Someday, our descendants may find out a way to build super-batteries that can be charged using renewable energy sources or nuclear power. At present, however, the only technology that fits the bill is bio fuel: a hydrocarbon energy source that we make in the here-and-now, whether from crops or from recycled cooking oil and animal fats. Last year, aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Embraer teamed up to open a biofuel research center in Brazil that will promote the development of sustainable aviation fuel. In December, Boeing carried out the first test flight of a 787 Dreamliner using “green diesel.” So far, this kind effort represents baby steps: the Dreamliner flight used just a 15 percent blend of green diesel with 85 percent conventionally derived fuel, and that only in one of its two engines. One problem with using higher percentages than that is that biofuel tends to freeze at typical airliner cruising altitudes. It’s also more difficult to store, and can damage engine parts. We’re a long way from running the world airline fleet on the stuff. So as you sling your beach duffel into the overhead bin in the summer, know that your fun in the sun this year will unavoidably play a role in making next’s years summer even summerier. If you want to minimize your carbon footprint, there’s really only one option. Just ask Slate writer Eric Holthaus. He’s come up with an effective strategy — one that allowed him, he writes, to go “from having more than double the carbon footprint as the average American to about 30 percent less than average.” His trick? He gave up his 75,000-mile-a-year travel habit cold turkey. “This has to be the last flight I ever take,” he tweeted as he boarded a plane last year. “I’m committing right now to stop flying.”	464	26	472	2023-04-05T11:47:06.254106Z	2023-04-05T11:47:06.254175Z	302.763	"[{""start"": 3842, ""end"": 4101, ""text"": ""To save energy, Solar Impulse is neither pressurized nor climate controlled, so that temperatures in the tiny cockpit swing between 86 F and -4 F.

It has now been more than 45 days since Solar Impulse took off from San Francisco for an across-the-nation journey powered only by the sun, and already there’s fatigue in some corners. When Solar Impulse finally landed in Washington, DC this weekend, there were no jubilant crowds of the type that met Charles Lindbergh when he arrived in Paris after his epic transatlantic flight. In fact, if you’re not getting regular e-mails from the Solar Impulse team or following along on social media in real-time, there’s a good chance that you missed the landing of Bertrand Piccard at Washington Dulles International Airport – it was just past midnight eastern time on Sunday, a time when most of the nation was already asleep. If you were asleep, and the news passed you by, stop for a second and take stock. There’s a reason you should care — and care deeply — about the journey of Solar Impulse. There’s more to the story than a funky solar-powered craft that looks like “an outsized balsa wood toy airplane”. Solar Impulse’s journey, in many ways, is a microcosm of our nation’s love/hate relationship with renewable energy. We love the promise of clean energy and celebrate the arrival of the latest green gizmos, but we have very little patience for renewable energy strategies that take years, if not decades, to pay off. Our ability to embrace the journey of a zero-fuel airplane over a sustained, 45-day flight from San Francisco to Washington offers a gut-check: Are we, as a nation, able to sustain the march to a zero-fuel economy. From the outset, the Across America mission from San Francisco to Washington (and then on to New York City) was about bringing awareness of clean energy technologies to America while celebrating the innovative spirit that challenges what is possible in today’s world. There’s a reason why the two pilots of the Solar Impulse plane – Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg – award each city they visit with a “Clean Generation” flag to celebrate that city’s embrace of clean technology. The Solar Impulse plane itself is a symbol of how renewable energy is a movement as much as a technology. It may be easy to minimize the accomplishments of an airplane that took 45 days to reach the Right Coast from the Left Coast. But think of what the Solar Impulse team accomplished. They proved that an airplane could make the coast-to-coast trip at day or night — in other words, with or without the sun. They also proved the resilience of two men who could pilot an airplane for upwards of 24 hours at a time – the next time you take a summer road trip, just count the number of times you’re tempted to take a break after just a few hours of driving. And they did this while finding solutions to counter the conditions of Mother Nature – strong headwinds, for example, forced the Solar Impulse team to make an unplanned pit stop in Cincinnati before continuing on to Washington. More importantly, Solar Impulse’s flight across America could unlock the future potential of solar energy. There’s a reason why the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum welcomed the arrival of Solar Impulse in Washington with open arms, and why Department of Energy chief Ernest Moniz said the journey highlighted “a cleaner energy future for the nation.” The technologies aboard Solar Impulse could be used in the air as well as on the ground to power the next generation of clean technologies – greener cars, cleaner appliances and more energy-efficient buildings. Moniz also pointed out ways that Solar Impulse could lead to better solar panels, better batteries (capable of storing the energy of the sun at night), and better, lighter materials. So, as the Solar Impulse team prepares for a journey around the world in 2015 that will include a voyage across the Atlantic and Pacific, let’s focus as much on the Journey as on the Jump. We live in a world where, as Seth Godin writes, we “get it” after reading a 140-character updates and watching 6-second videos. But that means ongoing narratives about the remarkable achievements in renewable energy sometimes get lost in our daily news feeds. So, we sometimes lose sight of the long-term impact one success story may have on another group of innovators located somewhere halfway around the globe. Sometimes the innovation story – even when it features a solar-powered plane traversing America or a solar-powered boat circling the world’s oceans – is not as easy to “get” as we might think.	463	26	470	2023-04-04T16:11:02.761532Z	2023-04-05T11:41:46.051496Z	681.828	"[{""start"": 2129, ""end"": 2254, ""text"": ""It may be easy to minimize the accomplishments of an airplane that took 45 days to reach the Right Coast from the Left Coast."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2129, ""end"": 2254, ""text"": ""It may be easy to minimize the accomplishments of an airplane that took 45 days to reach the Right Coast from the Left Coast."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2798, ""end"": 2907, ""text"": ""forced the Solar Impulse team to make an unplanned pit stop in Cincinnati before continuing on to Washington."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2798, ""end"": 2907, ""text"": ""forced the Solar Impulse team to make an unplanned pit stop in Cincinnati before continuing on to Washington."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
A solar-powered aircraft attempting a historic around-the-world journey completed its first leg Monday, landing in darkness in Oman after a flight of more than 13 hours from Abu Dhabi. The Swiss-made, single-seat plane — as light as a minivan but with the wingspan of a jumbo jet — left Abu Dhabi’s Al Bateen Executive Airport just as the sun was rising. It touched down in Oman’s capital, Muscat — more than 300 miles by air over desert and mountains — with its wings dotted by rows of lights. “Confirmation: We’re down!” said the commentator on the mission’s official Web site. Applause broke out in the control room in Monaco. The plane is to leave early Tuesday on its next leg, across the Arabian Sea to Ahmedabad, India. The plane runs only on solar power and cuts through the air mostly silently on a battery charge. Its wings, spanning as wide as those of a Boeing 747, carry more than 17,000 solar cells, which transfer energy to four electric motors that power the plane’s propellers. Electric bikes followed the plane, the Solar Impulse 2, as it taxied for takeoff, to prevent the wings from touching the runway, the BBC reported. Solar Impulse founder André Borschberg flew the plane on the first leg of its 21,700-mile journey. He will trade off with fellow Swiss co-founder Bertrand Piccard during layovers. “After 16 years of a dream and 12 years of hard work, we hope it will work,” Piccard told the BBC after the plane took off. Some legs of the 25-day journey, spread over five months, will entail five full days and nights of flying solo, such as when the plane crosses the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It is due back in Abu Dhabi in late July or August. The plane will stop at various locations around the world for the pilots to rest and do maintenance — and also to spread the message about clean, renewable technologies. [Related: U.S. utilities wage campaign against rooftop solar] The plane’s cockpit, about the size of a telephone booth, is so cramped that it holds only one person. The pilot will not be able to stand while flying, but the single seat reclines for stretching and its cushion can be removed to access a toilet. “We never feel alone in the cockpit, though,” Piccard told the BBC. He pointed out that flight pioneer Charles Lindbergh also flew in a small cockpit. Piccard said millions of people around the world were behind the prototype effort to find a more sustainable and cleaner alternative to aircraft powered by fossil fuels. [Related: Can a solar eclipse shut down Europe?] The Solar Impulse 2 weighs just over 5,000 pounds, about as much as a minivan or a mid-size truck. An empty Boeing 747 jet weighs about 400,000 pounds. Solar cells line the top of the Solar Impulse’s wings, and energy-dense lithium-ion batteries sustain it during nighttime flying. The best speed for the plane is about 28 mph, the pilots told the Associated Press. The slow speed means the journey’s legs will take several days and nights of nonstop flying. Borschberg has been practicing yoga and Piccard self-hypnosis to get ready for the historic endeavor, the AP reported. They aim to rest a maximum of 20 minutes straight, repeating the naps 12 times over a 24-hour period — akin to how a lone around-the-world yachtsman sleeps in snatches. Goggles will flash lights to wake the pilot up, the AP said, and armbands placed underneath the flying suit will buzz if the plane isn’t flying level. The aircraft will reach an altitude of about 28,000 feet during daytime hours to catch the sun’s rays. When flying over oceans at night, it will drop to about 5,000 feet. After two stops in India, the plane will head to China, where it will stay for a month until the days are longer so more of the sun’s energy can be tapped. It is to stop in Burma, Hawaii, Arizona and at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. The path across the Atlantic will depend on the weather and could include stops in southern Europe or Morocco. People can follow the flight at www.solarimpulse.com, tracking the plane’s battery status, energy consumption, location and path, as well as how much the pilot has slept and how much food and water he has left. There is also a live feed of the plane’s control room, with occasional footage from the cockpit. Prince Albert of Monaco, a Solar Impulse supporter, attended Monday’s takeoff. Other sponsors include Masdar, an Abu Dhabi clean-energy company; Omega; Google; and Moët Hennessey, the AP reported. “Now the adventure has started,” Piccard told the news agency at takeoff.

A team trying to fly a solar-powered plane around the world said Wednesday it is suspending the journey in Hawaii after the plane suffered battery damage during its record-breaking flight to the islands. The Solar Impulse team said in a news release that it will continue the attempt to travel around the globe, but irreversible damage caused by overheating batteries has grounded the flight until at least April. The batteries aboard Solar Impulse 2 overheated on the first day of its trip from Japan to Hawaii, and there was no way to cool down the system, the team said. The company says there was no weakness with the technology, but the team didn’t anticipate temperature fluctuations associated with rapid altitude changes in a tropical climate. Pilot André Borschberg and his single-seat aircraft landed at Kalaeloa, a small airport outside Honolulu, on July 3. His voyage of nearly 118 hours from Nagoya, Japan, broke the record for the world’s longest nonstop solo flight, his team said. “Solar Impulse is attempting a historic first of flying around the world only on solar energy,” the pilots said in a statement. “And while Solar Impulse has completed eight legs, covering nearly half of the journey, setbacks are part of the challenges of a project which is pushing technological boundaries to the limits.” The wings of Solar Impulse 2, which stretch wider than those of a Boeing 747, are equipped with 17,000 solar cells that power propellers and charge batteries. The plane ran on stored energy at night. The aircraft took off in March from Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, then made stops in Oman, Burma (also called Myanmar) and China. It then made an unplanned stop for nearly a month in Japan after high winds damaged a wing. The leg across the Pacific Ocean was the riskiest part of the plane’s global travels, as there was nowhere for it to land in an emergency. The plane’s ideal flight speed is about 28 miles per hour, though that can double during the day when the sun’s rays are strongest. The carbon-fiber aircraft weighs more than 5,000 pounds, or about as much as a minivan or midsize truck. The airplane will be kept in a University of Hawaii hangar at the Kalaeloa airport on Oahu while repairs are made. The team says it will also research and test other cooling methods to prevent more overheating. — Associated Press	456	26	464	2023-04-04T15:40:41.907912Z	2023-04-04T15:40:41.908017Z	185.844	"[{""start"": 7, ""end"": 413, ""text"": ""trying to fly a solar-powered plane around the world said Wednesday it is suspending the journey in Hawaii after the plane suffered battery damage during its record-breaking flight to the islands.

In early May, two solar aviation pioneers at Solar Impulse are going to attempt what has never been done before — a coast-to-coast flight across America, from San Francisco to Washington (and then on to New York), powered only by sunlight. They will not expend an ounce of fuel during the entire journey, and will be able to fly at both day and night, when the disappearing sun will effectively turn the one-seat plane covered with 12,000 solar cells into a subzero refrigerator. The epic journey – which the two co-founders and pilots of Solar Impulse (Solar Impulse CEO Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg) are calling Mission 2013: Across America – could help to usher in a new era of aviation powered by renewable energy sources, much as Charles Lindbergh’s celebrated non-stop, solo flight across the Atlantic from New York to Paris spurred the launch of the era of modern commercial aviation. It is all the more remarkable that Across America is just the latest step in the march toward the ultimate goal – an around-the-world solar-powered flight in 20 days and 20 nights, scheduled for 2015. Along the way, the Solar Impulse team has racked up an impressive number of firsts – the first day-and-night flight for a solar-powered plane, the first European flight in a solar-powered plane and the first intercontinental trip (Europe to Africa) in a solar-powered plane. And they’re doing it all in an incredibly light airplane that weighs less than an SUV but has the massive wingspan of a jumbo jet. Across America is reminiscent of the earliest days of flight aviation, when events like Kitty Hawk and Charles Lindbergh’s solo flight across the Atlantic stirred the popular imagination. To see a solar-powered craft glide over the Golden Gate Bridge is to understand what the first aviation pioneers felt when they learned that humans could, indeed, fly. Just as Lindbergh went from a relatively unknown aviation pilot for the U.S. Air Mail to one of the biggest celebrities of his era, the same could be true for the modern-day version of Charles Lindbergh. Piccard, building on the exploration legacy created by his father and grandfather, already has made a name for himself by becoming, along with Brian Jones, the first person to travel around the world by hot air balloon non-stop. (That balloon is now in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington.) Yet, as with any potentially disruptive technology, there are the skeptics. Even though the Solar Impulse team has proved that it’s capable of making day-and-night flights, any solar-powered plane is still highly susceptible to weather and wind conditions. Clouds, for example, pose a significant problem. And, by having room for just one passenger, the HB-SIA is not exactly a threat to the commercial airline majors anytime soon. With a max speed of less than 50 mph for the solar-powered plane, it’s theoretically possible that you could crisscross the country’s highways in your gas-guzzling SUV in a shorter time than it takes Solar Impulse to make the trip from San Francisco, Calif. to Washington, D.C. But that’s missing the bigger point. Aircraft powered by alternative energy sources—such as solar energy—are a classic type of disruptive innovation in that they appear only on the low-end before the benefits in price and performance push the innovation higher up the value chain. Increases in solar performance over time could lead to even larger airplanes carrying more passengers at faster speeds over longer distances. Eventually, you may be able to book a flight on a solar-powered commercial airline. And, as with any disruptive innovation, the entrenched incumbents will then be scrambling to come up with their own solutions—such as new bio-fuels that are cheaper to burn than traditional fossil fuels. The U.S. Air Force, for example, is already working on renewable energy solutions for its fleet of planes. In nearly every interview or press conference, Solar Impulse’s Bertrand Piccard uses the word “pioneer” or the term “pioneering spirit.” There’s a reason for that—it speaks to the type of courage and vision required for a cross-country mission of this magnitude. In a similar way, Charles Lindbergh named his plane the “Spirit of St. Louis” to showcase the spirit and resolve needed to accomplish such an audacious goal. Flying coast-to-coast across America using only the energy from the sun renews hope that the era of “perpetual flight” is around the corner—an era when expensive aviation fuel has been replaced by the cheap, plentiful fuel of the sun. If you look up at the Washington Monument as the Solar Impulse plane glides overhead, you might just glimpse the future of aviation.

The takeoff was planned under the cover of darkness. After two months of setbacks, delay and dismay, the team aiming to accomplish the first ever solar-powered plane trip around the world wanted to start its longest and most difficult leg in secret. If they had to turn back yet again, Solar Impulse co-founder and pilot Bertrand Piccard explained in a video interview (he’s not flying this leg), the team didn’t want to disappoint their fans, or the news media. Better to take off from Japan and see what happens before making the flight public. So they waited. And waited. And Monday morning, 10 hours after takeoff, Piccard’s fellow pilot and founder Andre Borschberg tweeted an image from the air: the plane’s wing silhouetted against the sunrise, pointing forward. “Very strong emotions as I passed the point of no return: exploration starts here,” he wrote. This is the project’s the moment of truth, Piccard elaborated from the ground. Either Solar Impulse 2 makes it to Hawaii, or it doesn’t make it at all. [Meet Solar Impulse 2, the solar-powered plane that never has to land] The five-day flight from Nagoya Airfield in Japan to Kalaeloa, Hawaii will be the ultimate test of Piccard and Borschberg’s project, conceived more than a decade ago. If it’s successful, the trip will be the longest ever made by crewed plane running entirely on solar power. The team is depending on 120 hours of good weather, good light and good luck to keep the tiny aircraft aloft. Solar Impulse has no fuel on board, other than the energy from the sun stored up in its batteries. But they believe it’ll be enough to carry the plane through the five nights it’ll take to get to the next runway. Borschberg is ready if it’s not. He’s equipped with a dinghy, enough supplies to last him several days, and the training to bail out of a failing aircraft. But neither he nor his partner is the type to dwell long on negative possibilities. Especially not Piccard, the grandson of a famed physicist and balloonist and the son of the undersea explorer Jaques Piccard. If nature didn’t incline him toward this type of quixotic quest, nurture certainly did. Piccard said in 2013 that his household growing up was brimming with heady tales of discovery and discussions of mankind’s endless potential for progress. He didn’t realize there was any other way to look at a problem except as a possibility. “All the most incredible things seemed to be completely normal,” Piccard told an audience at the NASA Ames Research Center in California, according to the New York Times. “I thought this was the normal way to live and I was very disappointed to see that there are a lot of people who are afraid of the unknown, afraid of the doubts, afraid of the question marks.” In 1999, he and fellow aeronaut Brian Jones became the first people to complete a nonstop trip around globe in a balloon. But that journey was nearly cut short by a propane shortage. For the sake of exploration, and the environment, Piccard began dreaming of a way to fly without fuel. He and Jones launched a feasibility study in 2001 at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne, Switzerland, bringing Swiss Air Force pilot and entrepreneur Borschberg on board as manager. They publicly launched the project two years later and began work on a prototype in 2003. Their original model, Solar Impulse 1, made its first flight in 2009 — a 350-meter “flea hop” that took it just one meter above the runway in Dübendorf, Switzerland. It was not the first time a solar-powered plane had ever left the ground, but it was the first time that a plane with the potential to fly through the night had done so. [First leg completed in bid to pilot solar-powered plane around globe] Solar Impulse 2, the plane attempting this year’s round-the-world trip, is loaded with nearly 50 percent more solar cells than its predecessor but is incredibly lightweight. Though it has roughly the same wingspan as an Airbus A380, the world’s largest commercial aircraft currently in service, it’s less than 1 percent of the Airbus’s weight — even when the A380 isn’t carrying passengers. So long as the sunlight holds, the tiny plane could feasibly fly around the world forever. Really, Piccard jokes during speeches, the only thing that isn’t sustainable about Solar Impulse 2 is its pilot. The telephone booth-sized cockpit fits only one person, and humans — unlike the plane — can only fly through the night for so long. That’s part of the reason that this round-the-world trip is being undertaken in stages, with Piccard and Borschberg alternating time at the controls. The Nagoya to Hawaii trip is leg eight of a 13-part journey that began in Abu Dhabi in March. The numerous stops allow the pilots to trade off, gives crews a chance to inspect and repair the craft and provides an opportunity for Piccard and Borschberg to evangelize about clean, renewable technology. Their project is sponsored by Masdar, an Abu Dhabi clean-energy company; Omega; Google and Moët Hennessey, among others. The month-long layover in Japan was unplanned; Borschberg had originally intended to make the six-day flight from Nanjing, China to Kalaeloa in one go. But bad weather in early June grounded the plane, and a second flight attempt later in the month was cancelled because of concerns about weather conditions. Even Borschberg and Piccard began expressing doubts about their ability to complete the journey. “If we cannot finish this year, we will finish next year,” Borschberg told CNN on June 19. Finally this week the 150 meteorologists, flight experts and engineers behind the project found the right five-day weather window to set off on the plane’s riskiest flight yet. Now Solar Impulse 2 moves noiselessly through the air at a modest 28 miles per hour, rising to 28,000 feet during the day to catch the sun’s rays, and sinking to just 5,000 above the ocean while flying at night. There’s no room in the tiny cockpit for standing or moving around — the toilet is simply a hole beneath a cushion on the pilot’s seat. But Borschberg needs to keep his eyes on the controls. The lightweight plane responds to the slightest changes in weather and wind, meaning he must be constantly alert. He and Piccard trained themselves to sleep for a mere 20 minutes at a time, 12 times a day. During flight they wear goggles that flash lights to wake them up, and armbands beneath their flight suit will buzz if the plane isn’t flying straight. In a livestream of the flight available on the Solar Impulse web Site Monday, sunlight poured through a window into the plane, glinting off the equipment and the thin plastic coils of Borschberg’s oxygen mask tubes. The rhythmic scratch of his breathing was the only sound coming from the cockpit. He was just 13 hours into the 120 journey, with nothing but open ocean beneath him and no place to land should anything go wrong. “It was really a jump in the unknown,” Piccard said in the video interview. “… Until now we have been in a protected environment, in controlled airspace, with our references, with all our benchmarks. And here we lose everything at once.” That made the decision to take off difficult for the rest of the Solar Impulse team, Piccard explained. They almost didn’t let Borschberg fly out into that risky unknown. But in his final Twitter dispatch before takeoff, Borschberg was determinedly optimistic about the endeavor. “All scientific breakthroughs start with a crazy idea and are first said to be impossible,” it read.	450	26	458	2023-04-04T14:54:49.685051Z	2023-04-04T14:54:49.685104Z	623.925	"[{""start"": 4316, ""end"": 4401, ""text"": ""The telephone booth-sized cockpit fits only one person, and humans — unlike the plane"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6096, ""end"": 6209, ""text"": ""The lightweight plane responds to the slightest changes in weather and wind, meaning he must be constantly alert."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5906, ""end"": 6039, ""text"": ""There’s no room in the tiny cockpit for standing or moving around — the toilet is simply a hole beneath a cushion on the pilot’s seat"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
Update: Solar Impulse 2 took off April 21 from Hawaii. It landed in Mountain View, California, on April 23. Early one morning last June, pilot André Borschberg stepped aboard an odd-looking plane — its wings long like those of an albatross, its cramped cabin as small as a refrigerator — and guided it into the sky above Japan. In a typical airliner, it would have taken him eight hours to arrive at his destination in Hawaii, but Borschberg was at the helm of Solar Impulse 2, a plane powered entirely by the sun’s rays. Lightweight but slow, traveling at an average of 38 miles per hour, it landed in Hawaii after 117 hours 52 minutes, or five days and five nights — the longest solo flight in history. Borschberg, 63, and fellow Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard, 58, were in the middle of attempting the first round-the-world trip in a solar-powered plane, taking turns at the controls of the single-seat aircraft. They left Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East, in March 2015, and have divided their trip into 13 segments. The flight from Japan to Hawaii was the longest and most dangerous. On the first day, a quick ascent overheated the plane’s batteries, which store energy supplied by hair-thin solar cells that cover the top of the plane. The batteries could not be cooled enough during the long flight to prevent permanent damage. Now, after replacing the plane’s batteries and waiting for calm, sunny weather, the pilots are ready to resume their journey. Later in April, Piccard will make the four-day flight from Hawaii to North America, where, depending on the weather, he’ll land in Arizona or California or near the Canadian city of Vancouver. From there, he and Borschberg will continue across North America to Europe and finish their journey in Abu Dhabi this summer. Piccard answered some questions for KidsPost last weekend during an 18-hour flight above Hawaii to test the plane’s instruments before continuing the big trip. Solar cells work well enough to power a plane, but the plane needs to be extremely lightweight to conserve energy. The cabin fits just one pilot at a time, and there’s no room for baggage. The walls are thin and the plane isn’t pressurized, which means that the pilot has to dress like a mountaineer and wear an oxygen mask at high altitudes. Piccard says he was born for this kind of ad­ven­ture. His grandfather was a balloonist, and his father, Jacques Piccard, explored the deepest part of the ocean. “I remember very clearly saying to myself . . . that I also wanted to have that kind of life; the life of an explorer, interesting and useful,” he said. He made the first nonstop, round-the-world balloon flight in 1999. Soon after, he set his sights on a round-the-world solar flight and joined up with Borschberg. The flight is all about promoting cleaner, environmentally friendly technologies, he said, adding that using such devices as LED lamps and electric or hybrid vehicles “will make a big difference in the world” by helping conserve energy and resources. Flying for four or five days at a time with only occasional 20-minute naps can take a lot of focus. The plane weighs about as much as a small car but has the wingspan of a jetliner, making it very sensitive to wind and to little adjustments at the controls. “A few moments ago I saw hundreds of dolphins swimming in the water near the coast of Hawaii,” Piccard said. “It was so beautiful I got distracted and the airplane went outside its flight path for just a couple seconds.” An alarm rang in the cockpit, alerting him to make an adjustment so he would not lose control of the plane. Unfazed, Piccard tweaked the controls and flew on. The dolphins kept swimming.	449	26	457	2023-04-04T14:44:21.856897Z	2023-04-04T14:44:21.856968Z	3320.447	"[{""start"": 328, ""end"": 704, ""text"": ""In a typical airliner, it would have taken him eight hours to arrive at his destination in Hawaii, but Borschberg was at the helm of Solar Impulse 2, a plane powered entirely by the sun’s rays.

"Your garbage could help fuel airplanes. United Airlines announced Tuesday what it called the largest investment by an American airline in alternative fuels. The Chicago-based airline is buying a $30 million stake in Fulcrum Bioenergy and plans to go into business with the company, building factories to convert trash into jet fuel. Under pressure to curb their carbon emissions and at the mercy of oil prices, airlines are increasingly looking for alternatives to help wean their fuel-intensive businesses off fossil fuels, although it could be years before they do. But the move isn't likely to lead to lower ticket prices anytime soon. Biofuels would represent a small portion of the fuel used by the airline. And the airline industry has been enjoying record profits lately, largely thanks to plunging fuel prices, but that hasn't affected ticket much prices either. Biofuels could help keep costs down when energy prices rise again, United says. United and Fulcrum plan to build as many as five factories near United hubs. James Macias, chief executive of California-based Fulcrum, wouldn’t say which cities they are considering, but said that the company is eyeing Washington. (The companies are not disclosing the terms of their agreement, including United’s equity share.) “Your garbage will go in, and within weeks it’ll be flying in airplanes,” Macias said. Fulcrum, which was founded seven years ago, isn’t the only company looking to carve out a slice of the multibillion dollar market for jet fuel. Airlines have tested alternatives made from everything from used cooking oil to algae. At least 20 airlines worldwide have tested biofuels on their flights since 2011, according to the Europe-based trade group Air Transport Action Group. Alaska Airlines partially uses fuel made from cooking oil on 75 of its routes. United also plans to start using biofuel from another provider on some of its Los Angeles flights this summer. But it could still be a while before garbage and other alternatives make a dent in airlines’ petroleum use. Fulcrum plans to open its first factory in Nevada in the second half of 2017, and it expects to produce 10 million gallons a year. James Macias, Fulcrum’s chief executive, said that the company expects to be making 300 million gallons a year in five years. Not all of that fuel will go to United, but even if it did, it would still represent only a small portion of the billions of gallons the airline uses each year. United used 3.9 billion gallons of fuel last year. “The sustainable aviation biofuel market is in its infancy (from a production standpoint), and thus total supply is small,” United spokeswoman Mary Ryan said in an email, adding that the company hopes to spur growth in the alternative fuel market. Buying that much fuel carries an enormous price tag – $11.7 billion for United last year – making fluctuating oil prices a key concern for the industry. Fuel is the most expensive part of running an airline, accounting for about a third of their operating costs each year. Fluctuations add up: If the price of a barrel of crude oil increases by one dollar, it would cost United $93 million over the course of a year, the company said in a regulatory filing. Fulcrum can make a gallon of fuel for less than a dollar, Macias said, but the company will sell its product at the market price. Airlines, which account for 3 percent of the U.S.’s greenhouse gas emissions, are also under pressure to reduce their carbon footprints. Global regulators are drafting aviation emissions standards to implement next year, and the Environmental Protection Agency says it plans to adopt them. Separately, members of the International Air Transport Association, a global trade group, have said they plan to cap their emissions in 2020 and halve their output by 2050, based on 2005 levels. ""Investing in alternative fuels is not only good for the environment,” Brett Hart, United’s general counsel, said in a statement. “It's a smart move for our company as biofuels have the potential to hedge against future oil price volatility and carbon regulations.”"	446	26	454	2023-04-04T13:37:36.659487Z	2023-04-04T13:37:36.659557Z	1324.832	"[{""start"": 2517, ""end"": 2763, ""text"": ""“The sustainable aviation biofuel market is in its infancy (from a production standpoint), and thus total supply is small,” United spokeswoman Mary Ryan said in an email, adding that the company hopes to spur growth in the alternative fuel marke"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1940, ""end"": 2047, ""text"": ""But it could still be a while before garbage and other alternatives make a dent in airlines’ petroleum use."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2179, ""end"": 2464, ""text"": ""James Macias, Fulcrum’s chief executive, said that the company expects to be making 300 million gallons a year in five years.
