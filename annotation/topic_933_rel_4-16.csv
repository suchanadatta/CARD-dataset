I recently used my credit card to buy a banana. Then I tried to figure out how my credit card let companies buy me. You might think my 29-cent swipe at Target would be just between me and my bank. Heavens, no. My banana generated data that’s probably worth more than the banana itself. It ended up with marketers, Target, Amazon, Google and hedge funds, to name a few. Oh, the places a banana will go in the sprawling card-data economy. Despite a federal privacy law covering cards, I found that six types of businesses could mine and share elements of my purchase, multiplied untold times by other companies they might have passed it to. Credit cards are a spy in your wallet — and it’s time that we add privacy, alongside rewards and rates, to how we evaluate them. Apple, branching out from gadgets, just began offering a needed alternative. The new Apple Card’s best attribute is privacy (though the fashion faux pas of its white titanium has gotten more attention). Apple restrains bank partner Goldman Sachs from selling or sharing your data with marketers. But the Apple Card, which runs on the Mastercard network, doesn’t introduce much new technology to protect you from a lot of other hands grabbing at the till. With my banana test — two bananas, one purchased with the popular Chase Amazon Prime Rewards Visa and the other with Apple’s Mastercard — I hoped to uncover the secret life of my credit card data. But in this murky industry, I was only partly successful. Unlike my other recent technology experiments, such as watching what my iPhone does while I sleep, I couldn’t hack into my cards to follow the data. Instead, I asked insiders and privacy advocates to help identify the types of companies that had given themselves access to my swipe for purposes unrelated to payment and preventing fraud. “Where does it end? Nobody really knows,” says Ted Rossman, an analyst at comparison site CreditCards.com. I pored over these companies’ privacy policies. Then I asked more than two dozen to get specific about what they actually do with our transactions. What data are they sharing and with whom? Some didn’t answer. Others sent me to a Bermuda Triangle of legalese where few straight answers escaped alive. In 2019, it’s hard to trust companies that don’t think they owe us clarity about data. What I learned: The card data business is booming for advertisers, for aiding investors and for helping retailers and banks encourage more spending. And there are many ways a card swipe can be exploited that don’t always require a transaction being “sold” or “shared” in a way that fully identifies you. Data can be aggregated, anonymized, hashed or pseudonymized (given a new name), or used to target you without ever technically changing hands. What’s the harm? We’re legally protected from fraudulent charges and unfair lending practices. But spending patterns can reveal lots — possibly enough to blackmail you. Anytime data passes to new hands, there’s another chance it could get stolen. (Witness: Equifax.) And card data surely helps businesses but can put consumers at a relative disadvantage. “The more they know they know about you, the more opportunities there are for manipulation,” says Chris Hoofnagle, a law and information professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Data can be used to model behaviors, such as figuring out exactly how many price hikes or awful experiences customers will put up with before bolting. People can have different views on whether it’s worth exchanging data for airline miles or cash back. But how are we supposed to make informed decisions when we don’t know where our data is going? So who all can track, mine or share your transactions? Where does the Apple Card help? Let’s unravel the six kinds of companies that sold me out. It’s bananas. When I swiped my cards, of course my banks received data. What’s surprising is who they can share it with. My data helped identify me to Chase’s marketing partners, who send me junk mail. Some data even got fed to retail giant Amazon because it co-branded my card. Banks have long been required to report suspicious transactions to the government. But the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also allows banks to share personally identifiable data with companies. They just have to send a privacy notice and give you the right to opt out. (More on opting out below.) When I used my Visa, Chase’s privacy statement reserves the right to share my data for seven different kinds of reasons. The most appalling category is: “For nonaffiliates to market to you.” Who are “nonaffiliates?” Whoever the bank darned well wants. The term just means a company not owned by Chase. Chase would not tell me the specific data it shared from my card or the companies it shared it with. Instead, spokeswoman Patricia Wexler listed kinds of data Chase doesn’t share — including “personalized transaction level data.” But that leaves room for lots of uses. Chase, for example, opts us in to receiving offers from partner companies based on our spending habits. This is where the Apple Card is different. In the Goldman Sachs privacy statement, its answer to most kinds of sharing is “no.” Goldman still shares information with credit agencies about whether you pay your bills. But it says it doesn’t feed transactions to marketers or a sister company that mines card data. Co-branded card partners get a piece of the action, too. Of course Amazon receives data when you buy products on Amazon with its card. What about other purchases? Chase says it shares information with co-brand partners “at a high level only — not specific details around which merchant, and not specific items purchased,” but Wexler declined to be specific. Amazon also wouldn’t say exactly what it receives. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) As a co-branded partner, Apple says it can’t access data about your transactions outside Apple. The details of your purchases, visible in the Wallet app, are encrypted so Apple can’t see them. This is where Apple’s advantage starts to fade. Once my banana purchase passed to card networks run by Visa and Mastercard, either might have shared them — in an anonymized form — with businesses including tourism bureaus, Google and more. The networks, whose main business is connecting banks, have side gigs in aggregating purchases and selling them as “data insights.” Visa said it allows clients to see data on populations as small as 50 people, often tied to groups in Zip codes. Mastercard wouldn’t disclose its minimum group size. One Mastercard program particularly irks privacy advocates. Bloomberg has reported that data from millions of Mastercards — now likely including Apple Cards — ends up helping Google track retail sales. Data goes into a double-blind system that lets the Web giant link ads people have seen back to purchases they’ve made in the real world. A person familiar with the matter, who wasn’t authorized to speak about it, confirmed the deal to me. The firms wouldn’t acknowledge the specific program but emphasize Mastercard scrubs identifiable information. Mastercard spokesman Jim Issokson said, “Mastercard is not sharing any data or insights for ad measurement purposes to any of the tech giants.” Google spokeswoman Anaik von der Weid said, “We have developed advanced, privacy protective technology in this area, precisely to avoid the sharing of personal information.” To Target, my credit card acted as a kind of ID — each swipe helps build a “guest profile” about me. That’s useful for learning my habits, targeting me with ads on Facebook and sharing information about me with others. It made no difference whether I paid with the Chase Visa or Apple Card. Target says it does not “sell” our data. But its privacy policy grants it the right to “share your personal information with other companies” who “may use the information we share to provide special offers and opportunities to you.” Who are these companies: Marketers? Data brokers? Other retailers? Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck wouldn’t say. What specifically does Target share? That “varies,” Reck said but added, “We provide aggregated, de-identified information whenever possible.” The tech that helps stores track us often comes from card-swipe machines and the merchant banks that process transactions for them. Those firms gain access to your name, card number and other details and often reserve rights to share data in some form. What are they doing with it? This is where my data trail gets particularly murky. Target wouldn’t say who its so-called acquiring bank is or what restrictions it places on it. Target also wouldn’t say what data restrictions it puts on the company that makes its swipe terminals, Verifone. That company didn’t answer my emails. An experience you might have had at a coffee shop shows what’s possible. Ever swipe your card and the terminal already knows the phone number or email to send a receipt? That’s because the system has linked your card to a profile — and you’ve volunteered those details before. Square, one maker of those systems, says it does not “sell” that data. But it does pass an email or phone number we enter for receipts back to the merchant. And it shares aggregated data about purchases with organizations including trade groups. I paid for my bananas with physical cards, but smartphone-payment systems introduce even more hands on transactions. Apps can access and store not only what you buy but also where you go. Google Pay for Android stores transactions in your Google account. Google says it doesn’t allow advertisers to target you based on that data. But Google Pay’s default privacy settings, which you can adjust, grant it rights to use your personal information to allow Google companies to market to you. The Samsung Pay app has details from your past 20 transactions, though the company says the information isn’t stored on its servers. The app also delivers location-based promotions. Apple says it doesn’t retain transaction information “that can be tied back to you” when you use Apple Pay. Many free financial services are after your data. Intuit’s Mint, which lets you track all your accounts in one place, uses your data to market to you in its app. Financial software maker Yodlee sells de-identified data from customers to market research firms, retailers and investors. Your email might also be a mole. Anytime you receive a receipt in Gmail, Google adds to it to a purchases database. Google says it doesn’t use the contents of Gmail to target ads, but that leaves open other uses. If you care about privacy, there are steps you can take to better protect your life as a consumer — but it’s patchwork. Perhaps it goes without saying, but you could pay with cash. That won’t help if you swipe a loyalty card ... or once businesses start using facial recognition. I plan to continue using the Apple Card, even though its rewards aren’t as good as other cards. Its contracts with Goldman protect you from some bank surveillance capitalism. Apple Card also doesn’t work with nosy apps like Mint — you have to access your account details through the app on your iPhone. But I’m disappointed Apple didn’t build new kinds of privacy technology to help counteract all the other categories of companies using each swipe. For example, the card offered by a start-up called Privacy uses a different number for each (online only) transaction so you can’t be as easily tracked. By law, credit card companies give us ways to opt out of some of their data sharing, though sharing with other financial institutions and joint-marketing partners is usually exempt. Chase and American Express have online forms you can fill out. To opt out with Citibank you have to call 888-214-0017; for Discover call 800-225-5202. Through online forms, you can also opt out of the data-sharing programs with Visa and Mastercard. (Anyone with an Apple Card will need to do this to bolster their privacy.) Even some stores offer an out. Target says customers can call 800-440-0680 and ask to be removed from having personal information shared for marketing. Many of these companies say giving us these “choices” is sufficient. That’s nonsense. With data, the devil is in the defaults — companies know a vanishingly small number of people will ever adjust settings. And how can we exercise a choice if we don’t even know what’s happening with our data? The recent headlines about Facebook and Equifax opened a lot more eyes to how privacy affects our lives in unforeseen ways. Other businesses should take that as a warning: Data is the new corporate social responsibility. If a company wants our trust, it’s no longer good enough to say, “We care about your privacy,” and point to some legalese. It’s time to come clean.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Google has begun using billions of credit-card transaction records to prove that its online ads are prompting people to make purchases – even when they happen offline in brick-and-mortar stores, the company said Tuesday. The advance allows Google to determine how many sales have been generated by digital ad campaigns, a goal that industry insiders have long described as “the holy grail” of online advertising. But the announcement also renewed long-standing privacy complaints about how the company uses personal information. To power its multibillion-dollar advertising juggernaut, Google already analyzes users’ Web browsing, search history and geographic locations, using data from popular Google-owned apps like YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and the Google Play store. All that information is tied to the real identities of users when they log into Google’s services. The new credit-card data enables the tech giant to connect these digital trails to real-world purchase records in a far more extensive way than was possible before. But in doing so, Google is yet again treading in territory that consumers may consider too intimate and potentially sensitive. Privacy advocates said few people understand that their purchases are being analyzed in this way and could feel uneasy, despite assurances from Google that it has taken steps to protect the personal information of its users. Google also declined to detail how the new system works or what companies are analyzing records of credit and debit cards on Google’s behalf. Google, which saw $79 billion in revenue last year, said it would not handle the records directly but that its undisclosed partner companies had access to 70 percent of transactions for credit and debit cards in the United States. “What’s really fascinating to me is that as the companies become increasingly intrusive in terms of their data collection, they also become more secretive,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. He urged government regulators and Congress to demand answers about how Google and other technology companies are collecting and using data from their users. Google said it took pains to protect to protect user privacy. ""While we developed the concept for this product years ago, it required years of effort to develop a solution that could meet our stringent user privacy requirements,"" Google said in a statement. ""To accomplish this, we developed a new, custom encryption technology that ensures users' data remains private, secure, and anonymous."" The announcement comes as Google attempts to weather an outcry from advertisers over how their ad dollars are spent. Google is working to move past an advertising boycott of YouTube, its lucrative video site, after news reports that ads for mainstream brands were appearing alongside extremist content, including sites featuring hate speech and violence. Google for years has been mining location data from Google Maps in an effort to prove that knowledge of people’s physical locations could “close the loop” between physical and digital worlds. Users can block this by adjusting the settings on smartphones, but few do so, say privacy experts. This location tracking ability has allowed Google to send reports to retailers telling them, for example, whether people who saw an ad for a lawn mower later visited or passed by a Home Depot. The location-tracking program has grown since it was first launched with only a handful of retailers. Home Depot, Express, Nissan, and Sephora have participated. “Google — and also Facebook — believe that in order to get digital dollars from advertisers who are still primarily spending on TV, they need to prove that digital works,” said Amit Jain, chief executive of Bridg, a digital advertising start-up that matches online to offline behavior. “These companies have to invest in finding the identity of the consumer at the moment when that shopper is at the cash register.” Tuesday’s announcement gives Google a clearer way to understand purchases than just location and allows them to understand purchase activity even when consumers deactivate location tracking on their smartphones. Google executives say they are using complex, patent-pending mathematical formulas to protect the privacy of consumers when they match a Google user with a shopper who makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. The mathematical formulas convert people’s names and other purchase information, including the time stamp, location, and the amount of the purchase, into anonymous strings of numbers. The formulas make it impossible for Google to know the identity of the real-world shoppers, and for the retailers to know the identities of Google’s users, said company executives, who called the process “double-blind” encryption. The companies know only that a certain number of matches have been made. In addition, Google does not know what products people bought. “Through a mathematical property we can do double-blind matching between their data and our data,” said Jerry Dischler, vice president of product management for AdWords, Google's online advertising service, in an interview. “Neither gets to the see the encrypted data that the other side brings.” The tech giant declined to describe its mathematical formulas in anything more than broad terms, citing a pending patent. Dischler said the work was based on a 2011 research paper by three MIT scientists, which was funded by Google and Citigroup. Dischler described the modeling as a “revolutionary” step forward for both Google and advertisers. He added that users who signed into Google’s services had consented to Google sharing their data with third parties. But the company would not say how merchants had obtained consent from consumers to pass along their credit-card information. Google said it requires its partners to use only personal data that they have the “rights” to use, but it would not say whether that meant the consumers had consented. In the past, both Google and Facebook have obtained purchase data for a more limited set of consumers who participate in store loyalty programs. Those consumers are more heavily tracked by retailers, and often give consent to share their data with third parties as a condition of signing up. Tuesday’s initiative enables Google to use transaction data from a much wider swath of consumers than ever before, but the lack of detail on how personal data was being handled caused concern for privacy advocates. Paul Stephens, of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer advocacy group based in San Diego, said only a few pieces of data can allow a marketer to identify an individual, and he expressed skepticism that Google’s system for guarding the identities of users will stand up to the efforts of hackers, who in the past have successfully stripped away privacy protections created by other companies after data breaches. “What we have learned is that it’s extremely difficult to anonymize data,” he said. “If you care about your privacy, you definitely need to be concerned.” Such data providers have been the targets of cybercriminals in the past. In 2015, a hack of data broker Experian exposed the personal information of 15 million people.

Google agreed to pay a $22.5 million penalty — the largest ever levied by the Federal Trade Commission — to settle charges that it failed to honor the privacy settings of millions of people who use Apple’s Safari Web browser, regulators said Thursday. While the settlement had been widely reported prior to Thursday’s announcement, the FTC used the opportunity to lay out its thinking on the case and defend itself against critics — including one of its commissioners — who say the fine should have been heftier. The FTC alleges that Google misled Safari users into believing that it would not track their online activities and target advertisements to them. When it did so anyway, Google violated a 20-year order it signed last year involving privacy breaches on Buzz, the company’s now-defunct social networking application, the government said. In a call with reporters, FTC officials said the agency did not want to impose a fine that would “cripple” a legitimate company. Instead, the FTC wanted to send a message to Google and others that it would not tolerate flagrant disregard for the settlements the agency negotiates. “We have Google under order for another 19 years, and I think this civil penalty order sends another message to Google that the FTC is not kidding around,” said David Vladeck, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. But while some consumer privacy rights advocates cheered the settlement, others said it was inadequate, given Google’s size and its history of flouting the privacy promises it makes to consumers. Among the critics was FTC Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch, who said that allowing Google to settle without admitting wrongdoing was “inexplicable.” Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit public interest group, voiced similar concerns and said it would oppose the settlement, which has to be approved by a federal judge. Google has blamed the Safari problems on a technical glitch. On Thursday, Google said in a statement that it has taken steps to remove the ad cookies, the computer code that tracks a user’s Web activities. The tracking cookies collected no personal information from Apple’s browsers, Google said. In a dissenting statement, Rosch said allowing Google to continue denying liability “in circumstances such as these is unprecedented.” While some may say the denial is justified by the historic penalty, the fine is a “de minimis amount of Google’s profit or revenues,” he wrote. The company collected $36.5 billion in ad fees last year. In response, the other four FTC commissioners said that “almost any penalty can be dismissed as insufficient” for a company of Google’s size. But the fine is substantial given that Google’s conduct was short-lived and did not yield significant revenue, they said.	624	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 250, ""text"": ""ogle agreed to pay a $22.5 million penalty — the largest ever levied by the Federal Trade Commission — to settle charges that it failed to honor the privacy settings of millions of people who use Apple’s Safari Web browser, regulators said Thursday"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 513, ""end"": 847, ""text"": ""The FTC alleges that Google misled Safari users into believing that it would not track their online activities and target advertisements to them.

Google would pay $22.5 million to the Federal Trade Commission, a record fine for the agency, under a tentative deal settling allegations that the search giant bypassed privacy settings on Apple computers, smartphones and tablets, according to people familiar with the agreement. The deal, which would require the final approval of the commission, addresses claims that a Google program tracked Web behavior even as the company told users that default settings on Apple’s Safari browser prevented such tracking. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the looming deal Tuesday. The conclusion of the FTC case would resolve one of a growing list of legal conflicts for Google, which has become a target for regulators in Europe, the United States and other nations wary of its commanding market power in the lucrative search business and its ambitions to extend its brand into many other areas. The FTC declined to comment. Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., issued a statement saying that it could not comment on the specifics of the case but that the company observed the “highest standards of privacy and security for our users.” Google officials have called the use of tracking cookies an accident caused by technical glitches that have been corrected. Privacy advocates have scoffed at those explanations. “When they get caught with their fingers in the cookie jar doing something they clearly should not be doing, they say, ‘Oops, it was completely by accident,’ ” said John M. Simpson of Consumer Watchdog, based in Santa Monica, Calif., and one of several groups to file complaints about Google’s alleged tracking on Apple browsers. Google and many other companies place cookies — small files that report on the characteristics of Web users — on computers so that, for example, a golf enthusiast sees advertisements for golf clubs or golf-themed vacations. The default setting on Apple’s Safari browser, however, blocked such cookies unless users specifically altered a setting to allow them. Beginning in 2009, Google noted this fact on a “Help Center” Web page. Last year, Google began using what it calls “temporary cookies” that were supposed to have the narrow function of letting the company know if a user signed in to Google services was viewing a Web ad. That was supposed to trigger the appearance of a small “+1” button on the ad. When users clicked the button, it would indicate their interest in the ad on the Google+ social network. Google officials have said this temporary cookie malfunctioned, allowing a wide range of targeted ads to appear on Web sites visited by users. Company officials say this action was inadvertent, but it conflicted with the language on the “Help Center” page. In the looming deal, the FTC alleges this conflict was a “deceptive practice,” a common legal tactic for the FTC, said those familiar with the agreement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal had not been finalized. The commission last year reached a settlement with Google regarding alleged privacy violations in its Google Buzz social network, giving it authority to fine the company $16,000 in each instance for future violations. Google has said that it stopped placing the temporary cookies immediately after learning of the problem from the Wall Street Journal in February and that it has taken other actions to remedy the problem. “We have now changed that [“Help Center”] page and taken steps to remove the ad cookies, which collected no personal information, from Apple’s browsers,” Google said in a statement. The $22.5 million FTC fine, if approved, would be the highest for a single company for violating an agency order. The previous record of $18.8 million was against a telemarketer in 2010. The FTC also is investigating Google on allegations of antitrust violations. European regulators are probing the company on privacy and antitrust grounds. Among the first to discover Google’s use of cookies on Apple’s browser was Stanford University graduate student Jonathan Mayer, who is working toward law and computer science degrees there. He came across the cookies while studying targeted advertising. It is impossible to know whether Google was aware of what its temporary cookies were doing, Mayer said, but he said the company should have known. “At minimum, we’re talking negligence or gross negligence,” he said.
