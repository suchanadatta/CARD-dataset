President Trump issued an order late Friday that supports a ban on many transgender troops, deferring to a new Pentagon plan that essentially cancels a policy adopted by the Obama administration. The decision revokes a full ban that Trump issued last summer but disqualifies U.S. troops who have had gender reassignment surgery, as recommended by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. “By its very nature, military service requires sacrifice,” Mattis wrote in a memo to the president that was released Friday. “The men and women who serve voluntarily accept limitations on their personal liberties — freedom of speech, political activity, freedom of movement — in order to provide the military lethality and readiness necessary to ensure American citizens enjoy their personal freedoms to the fullest extent.” Current transgender service members who have not undergone reassignment surgery should be allowed to stay, as long as they have been medically stable for 36 consecutive months in their biological sex before joining the military and are able to deploy across the world, Mattis recommended. Mattis recommended that anyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the condition of wanting to transition gender, since the Obama administration ended the Pentagon’s longtime ban on transgender service in 2016 may continue to serve. The decision amounts to a “grandfathering” of those affected by the new policy. The new plan will be challenged in court, just as the full ban that Trump issued last summer was, in at least four separate cases that are still ongoing. Federal judges allowed transgender service members to continue serving under the old ban and permitted transgender recruits to join the military as well. The Justice Department filed a copy of Mattis’s recommendations in at least one of those legal battles Friday. “In service to the ideological goals of the Trump-Pence base, the Pentagon has distorted the science on transgender health to prop up irrational and legally untenable discrimination that will erode military readiness,” said Aaron Belkin, who has studied transgender issues for the Palm Center, a think tank that had worked with the Obama administration in repealing the previous ban. “There is no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy. Our troops and our nation deserve better.” In his memo to the president, Mattis specifically challenged the thinking of the Obama administration when it repealed the ban in 2016. Mattis said that he found a Rand Corp. study — commissioned by the Pentagon under Obama that became a backbone of the repeal process — to be flawed. “It referred to limited and heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own,” Mattis wrote. “In short, this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or RAND assumed.” The new direction comes after months of the Pentagon’s grappling with how to change its policy after Trump unexpectedly tweeted July 26 that he was banning all transgender people from serving in the military. The president, without any plan in place, cited the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” that he believed transgender military service would cause, and said that he had consulted with “my Generals and military experts.” A day later, Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, released a memo effectively stopping the military from making any changes until a new policy was adopted, and Mattis backed the move. In August, Trump issued a presidential memorandum providing more detail. He accused the Obama administration of allowing transgender military service without identifying a “sufficient basis” that doing so would not “hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources,” and he directed Mattis to have the Pentagon adopt a new ban similar to the military’s former policy by Friday. The Obama administration began allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military in June 2016, following a review that dragged out months longer than expected amid internal conflict in the Pentagon over how the change would be made. Until then, the Pentagon considered gender dysphoria a disqualifying mental illness. In removing the ban, then-Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter stopped the military from involuntarily separating anyone in the service, and gave the service branches a year to iron out how they would begin processing transgender recruits. A year later, Mattis delayed allowing transgender recruits for an additional six months as the deadline neared, saying the issue needed more study. Trump’s tweets came a few weeks later. Federal judges required the military to allow transgender recruits beginning Jan. 1, and the Pentagon signaled in December that it would not stand in the way of the courts’ rulings. Instead, it issued new policy guidance to recruits to explain how to enlist transgender men and women, and stated in a policy paper that the guidance “shall remain in effect until expressly revoked.” dan.lamothe@washpost.com	491	26	498	2023-04-05T14:06:12.629250Z	2023-04-05T14:06:12.629310Z	993.365	"[{""start"": 2669, ""end"": 2963, ""text"": ""It referred to limited and heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own,” Mattis wrote"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3327, ""end"": 3426, ""text"": ""“tremendous medical costs and disruption” that he believed transgender military service would cause"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3941, ""end"": 4036, ""text"": ""hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2669, ""end"": 2963, ""text"": ""It referred to limited and heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own,” Mattis wrote"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
The U.S. Naval Academy and other service academies are beginning to enforce new restrictions on transgender students, following a Trump administration order that has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates. Last month, the Defense Department issued a directive that sharply curtailed eligibility for military service for the transgender community. It said people with a history of gender dysphoria would be disqualified unless they have been stable in their biological sex for three years, are willing to abide by military rules applying to their gender assigned at birth, and have not transitioned and do not need to transition in the view of medical providers. People with gender dysphoria feel a conflict between their gender assigned at birth and the gender with which they identify. The Pentagon directive took effect Friday, reversing an Obama-era action in 2016 that allowed military personnel to serve as openly transgender. The Naval Academy in Annapolis, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., and the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs are putting it in motion. “We’re implementing and following [Defense Department] policies,” Cmdr. David McKinney, a Naval Academy spokesman, said Wednesday. West Point and Air Force Academy officials referred questions to the Pentagon. McKinney said officials in Annapolis are expecting the eligibility restrictions to be enforced for prospective students in the Class of 2024 — that is, those applying to enter the Naval Academy in 2020. He said current midshipmen who are openly transgender will not be required to leave the academy. In July 2017, President Trump abruptly announced a ban on transgender military service members through a tweet: “After consultations with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,” Trump wrote at the time. “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.” Defense officials say the policy that was ultimately drafted is not a complete ban. It includes exceptions that officials say will allow transgender individuals to serve as long as they don’t have gender dysphoria and follow rules for their gender assigned at birth regarding uniforms, grooming and facilities. Critics call the Pentagon’s new policy a step backward for civil rights and for the military. They say it is tantamount to a ban on military service for transgender personnel. “It’s an arbitrary, discriminatory exclusion that will deprive the military of talented, skilled, dedicated, idealistic young people who want to dedicate their lives to serving our country,” said Shannon Minter, an attorney with the National Center for Lesbian Rights, who is active in legal efforts to halt the Trump administration’s action. Minter represents a midshipman at the Naval Academy named Regan Kibby, who is among a group of plaintiffs suing to block the Trump administration’s order. nick.anderson@washpost.com	490	26	497	2023-04-05T13:49:36.738247Z	2023-04-05T13:49:36.738334Z	143.929	"[{""start"": 1950, ""end"": 2133, ""text"": ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
: There is no valid medical or military rationale for banning openly transgender Americans from serving as their true selves, or from obtaining medically necessary health care. The department lifted its ban against transgender personnel in 2016. The military’s experience with open transgender service over the past three years has only corroborated that conclusion. Despite concerns about financial costs, the price tag of providing care for transgender troops has been negligible	488	26	495	2023-04-05T13:43:41.048198Z	2023-04-05T13:43:41.048356Z	32.062	"[{""start"": 375, ""end"": 406, ""text"": ""oncerns about financial costs,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 375, ""end"": 406, ""text"": ""oncerns about financial costs,"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected to propose to President Trump that transgender members of the U.S. military be allowed to continue serving despite the president’s call last summer for a ban on all transgender service members, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of the issue. The defense secretary was scheduled to brief the president Wednesday, but the meeting was postponed and will occur soon, officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss policy deliberations. Dana White, a spokeswoman for Mattis, said the secretary will provide his recommendation to Trump this week and the president will make an announcement at some point afterward. Officials at the White House and Pentagon declined to comment on the recommendations until Mattis delivers his plan. “This is a complex issue, and the secretary is taking his time to consider the information he’s been given,” White told reporters Thursday. “It’s an important issue, and again, he sees all of his decisions through the lens of lethality.” Trump surprised many Pentagon officials on July 26 by issuing a string of tweets in which he said he was banning all transgender people from the military, despite not having a plan in place. Trump tweeted that he had reached his decision “after consultation with my Generals and military experts,” citing the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” he believed it would cause. Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, moved afterward to stop any changes from taking place until a new policy was adopted, and Mattis backed the move. The Obama administration began allowing transgender people to openly serve in the military in June 2016, prompting some people to come out for the first time. It’s unclear whether Trump will adopt Mattis’s recommendations, which the president requested in an Aug. 25 executive order. Trump directed the military at the time to “return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016,” but left an opening under which Mattis could advise him in writing on changing Trump’s new policy. The order gave Mattis until Wednesday to establish a plan. A Rand Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon ahead of its 2016 policy change found that there were between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender service members among 1.3 million people on active duty — less than 1 percent of the force. The study concluded that it would cost between $2.4 million and $8.4 million to treat them annually, a “relatively small” amount. Mattis questioned last year whether the numbers in the Rand study were accurate, but said he wanted to study the issue further. It is not clear how Mattis’s recommendations will address how transgender recruits are processed. Before the Obama administration’s policy change, the Pentagon for years considered gender dysphoria a disqualifying mental illness. The policy adopted in 2016 banned the services from involuntarily separating people in the military who came out as transgender, and gave the Pentagon a year to determine how to begin processing transgender recruits. But Mattis delayed allowing transgender recruits for an additional six months as the deadline neared. The decision “in no way presupposes an outcome,” but needed additional study, Mattis wrote at the time. Trump issued his ban on Twitter a few weeks later. Since then, the Trump administration has been challenged in lawsuits, and federal judges required the Pentagon to open the military to transgender recruits beginning Jan. 1. The Pentagon indicated in December that it would not stand in the way of the court’s ruling and issued new policy guidance to recruiters on how to enlist transgender men and women. The policy paper “shall remain in effect until expressly revoked,” the memorandum said. Allowing transgender people to serve in the military is “mandatory,” it added, repeating Dunford’s earlier directive that all people will be “treated with dignity and respect.” Dunford, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee last fall, said transgender troops already in the military have served with honor. “I believe any individual who meets the physical and mental standards, and is worldwide deployable and is currently serving, should be afforded the opportunity to continue to serve,” he said. He added that he would continue to advise Trump that transgender service members who follow rules and regulations should not be ejected on the basis of their gender identity. “Senator, I can promise that that will be my advice,” he said, in response to a question from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). “What I’ve just articulated is the advice I’ve provided in private, and I’ve just provided in public.” dan.lamothe@washpost.com anne.gearan@washpost.com josh.dawsey@washpost.com	485	26	493	2023-04-05T13:41:29.506153Z	2023-04-05T13:41:29.506295Z	218.826	"[{""start"": 1347, ""end"": 1415, ""text"": ""tremendous medical costs and disruption” he believed it would cause."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2457, ""end"": 2556, ""text"": ""The study concluded that it would cost between $2.4 million and $8.4 million to treat them annually"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
IN A series of tweets Wednesday morning, President Trump turned his back on the thousands of transgender people currently serving in the military — and he did so with his characteristic dishonesty. He claimed that he had consulted “with my Generals and military experts” before deciding that transgender individuals would not be allowed “to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military” — a reversal of the policy adopted by the Obama administration. In fact, Mr. Trump appears to have made his decision hastily, interrupting an ongoing Pentagon review and taking key military and congressional players by surprise. He asserted that allowing transgender personnel to serve would result in “tremendous medical costs and disruption” — though careful studies and the experience of other nations have shown just the opposite. What the president no doubt did not consider is this: How will his decision affect the thousands of patriotic Americans now serving, including in war zones, who happen to be transgender? In addition to depriving them of the respect they deserve from their government, Mr. Trump puts them at risk: To continue serving, transgender personnel will have to conceal their identities, which in turn will make them less likely to come forward with health concerns or reports of sexual assault. Mr. Trump is essentially reinstating a shameful policy of silence and discrimination. The decision disregarded the results of a year-long review conducted by the Obama administration that found the costs associated with accepting transgender troops would be minor. The Rand Corp. estimated that allowing these troops to serve openly would have a “minimal impact” on troop readiness and would mean between $2.4 million and $8.4 million in additional health-care costs per year — a little more than a rounding error in the military budget. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine reached similar conclusions. Around the world, 18 countries allow transgender troops to serve openly and none have reported experiencing ill effects or “disruption.” The directive will surely weaken the armed forces, depriving them of thousands of service members and potential recruits. Yet Mr. Trump seems to have made his decision without significant input from the Defense Department. Several Pentagon officials told the New York Times they were caught off guard by the announcement, while spokeswomen for both the Senate and House Armed Services committees said the committees had not been informed in advance. A review of the policy ordered by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was not due to be completed until December. According to a report by Politico, the president’s precipitous action actually came in response to appeals from House Republicans, who feared a defense appropriations bill containing funds for Mr. Trump’s border wall would be blocked by their own disagreements over the issue. That thousands of serving military personnel would be abruptly stripped of their rights for such crass political reasons would be shocking — if Mr. Trump had not already drastically devalued the norms for presidential behavior. During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to “do everything” to protect members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. But his administration’s small-minded and ignorant policies toward transgender people — first students, and now service members — are doing just the opposite.

The Trump administration struggled Thursday to explain the details of a ban on transgender service members announced a day earlier by the president, amid criticism from Republicans that the policy change went too far. The military’s highest-ranking officer said in a letter to senior leaders Thursday that there would be “no modifications” to the current policy on transgender troops until further direction was received from the president. “In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,” said Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The lack of clear direction from officials left the status of thousands of active transgender service members in limbo, one day after President Trump’s sudden announcement on Twitter. Dunford’s message to his troops suggested that those in leadership roles were caught off guard, despite Trump’s insistence that he was implementing the ban at the behest of the military. “I know there are questions about yesterday’s announcement,” began Dunford’s letter to the heads of the military ­branches as well as commanders and senior enlisted leaders. The rollout of Trump’s new policy was bumpy from the start. While it has received praise from some Republicans, it has also antagonized some in the party. Several Republicans have refused to say whether they support the president. On Thursday, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) declined to back the ban and said he wanted to see what the Pentagon and the White House produced in their review. Several Republicans, including Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), on Wednesday criticized the president’s decision. “I don’t think we should be discriminating against anyone,” Hatch said. “Transgender people are people, and deserve the best we can do for them.” Adding to the confusion, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was on vacation this week. The secretary, who had only weeks ago asked for more time to review the policy, was informed of Trump’s decision Tuesday. With Mattis out, chief Pentagon spokeswoman Dana W. White released a statement Thursday that the Pentagon was “awaiting formal guidance from the White House as a follow-up” to Trump’s announcement. White promised there would be “detailed guidance” from the Pentagon in the “near future” on how the policy change would be implemented. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered no new information during a press briefing, repeating that the White House would work with the Pentagon to implement the plan. “Like I said, they’re going to have to work on the details as it all moves forward to lawfully implement that policy change from this point,” she said. A 2016 Rand Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon estimates that there are about 11,000 transgender troops in the reserves and active-duty military. Trump’s decision went further than anything under consideration by the Pentagon, which was nearing the end of its review on its transgender policy. Since President Barack Obama lifted the ban on transgender troops in June last year, hundreds of service members have come out and are serving openly. The only part of Obama’s policy the Pentagon was still reviewing was whether the military would admit recruits who identified as transgender. The question of transgender active-duty members appeared to have been settled. The Obama policy would have allowed the recruits to begin serving July 1, but Mattis delayed that change the day before the rule was to set in, saying more review was required. The six-month delay would have allowed a further review of how integrating transgender recruits would affect the military’s “readiness and lethality,” Mattis said in a memo last month. That review was due Dec. 1. Trump’s ban is also wider-ranging than what many conservative House members were seeking as they debated a new defense spending bill. These lawmakers had sought to prohibit the Pentagon from covering the cost of gender transition therapies for active-duty service members. They did not seek a blanket ban on transgender service members. Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) contacted Mattis and the White House before filing an amendment to the defense spending bill barring transgender service members from receiving gender reassignment therapy, according to a GOP congressional aide familiar with the conversations. While Hartzler’s office had heard from some Pentagon staffers on the issue, it was not until the day of the vote that Mattis returned Hartzler’s phone call, the aide said. Mattis did not give Hartzler a clear answer on the Pentagon’s plans on this issue, and so Hartzler went forward with her amendment, which ultimately failed. The amendment’s demise led House GOP members to lobby the White House directly. The impasse threatened military spending, but most important for Trump, it potentially held up money that had been appropriated for the border wall between the United States and Mexico, a key promise he had made during the campaign. Hartzler praised Trump’s announcement Wednesday, saying on Twitter, “President Trump’s decision . . . has the best interests of the #military in mind, and I thank him for taking action.” Trump’s intervention potentially sends the Pentagon back to the drawing board on an issue that had already required years of review and discussion. Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, a think tank that has helped the Pentagon research transgender people serving in the military, said in a statement Wednesday that the change would bring about something worse than the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy barring gay troops from serving openly that was repealed in 2010. “This is a shocking and ignorant attack on our military and on transgender troops who have been serving honorably and effectively for the past year,” Belkin said. Critics of the decision also say that the cost to cover medical treatments for transitioning service members would be a tiny fraction of the Pentagon’s overall budget. The Rand study estimated that gender-transition-related medical treatments would cost the military between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually. Jenna Johnson, Karoun Demirjian and James Hohmann contributed to this report. Read more: Trump called transgender troops a costly disruption. An expert who studied it says he’s wrong.

On July 26 of this year, President Trump announced the following over three tweets: After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you. I bring this up because, in the three weeks since, the United States military has not implemented the president’s pronouncement. Indeed, the very next day the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff informed the Pentagon that until otherwise ordered, the preexisting policies would stay in place and “we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.” Since then, there has been this odd Kabuki theater in which Trump pretends he has given an order and that he’s doing the military a favor and the military continues to act as if the president’s tweets do not exist and the issue remains under study. In some cases the military’s pushback has gone further. A service secretary actively spoke out against the president’s tweets, as reported by the Hill’s Ellen Mitchell: Recently confirmed Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer said he will follow any order the president gives on transgender troops, but that “any patriot” should be allowed to serve. “We will process and take direction of a policy that is developed by the [defense] secretary [with] direction from the president and march out smartly,” Spencer 	480	26	488	2023-04-05T13:20:03.507092Z	2023-04-05T13:20:03.507160Z	74.042	"[{""start"": 290, ""end"": 473, ""text"": ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
The House voted Thursday to strongly oppose President Trump’s ban on transgender people serving openly in the military, a symbolic rebuke led by Democrats angry at Trump’s reversal of a policy established under President Barack Obama. The resolution condemns the ban as discriminatory and rejects “the flawed scientific and medical claims upon which it is based,” but it does not move to actually change the policy. It instead “strongly urges” the Defense Department to not implement the ban and to “maintain an inclusive policy” on allowing qualified transgender people to serve in the military. The resolution passed 238 to 185, with five Republicans joining Democrats in backing the measure. There is no indication the GOP-majority Senate will take up the measure, though binding changes to the policy could be debated as part of the yearly defense authorization process. Speaking on the House floor Thursday, Democrats lambasted Trump for reversing the Obama policy. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the move “bigoted.” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) pointed to statements from military leaders — including Army Gen. Mark Milley, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — indicating that there were no indications that transgender troops had affected morale or readiness. “What this policy is primarily based on is ignorance and bias against the transgender community,” Smith said. “This is unfair discrimination, and it’s also harmful to national security.” The Pentagon said this month that it would begin enforcing the transgender troop ban for new applicants starting April 12. That announcement followed a January Supreme Court ruling backing Trump’s authority to roll back the previous policy. Under the new Pentagon policy, applicants with a history of gender dysphoria would be disqualified unless they have been stable in their biological sex for 36 months and are willing to follow military rules for that gender. People who have already transitioned away from their birth gender would not be eligible for service. Those who are already in the military or under contract to join before April 12 are covered under the Obama administration’s policy, which allowed people who have transitioned to join the military and allowed those already serving to transition as well. Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, dismissed the Democratic measure as a “messaging bill” and said he was concerned that the partisan measure could undermine the traditional bipartisan working relationship on military matters. Another Republican on the committee, Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), said it was unfair that some Americans were being excluded from military service based on conditions such as asthma and bunions while transgender people — who, she said, carried a similar risk of being unable to fight for medical reasons — were allowed to serve. “We should not carve out exceptions for an entire population,” she said. “Military service is a privilege, not a right.” Opponents of the transgender service ban continue to fight it in federal court, but the Trump administration has shown no indication of changing course on the policy — first announced publicly in a July 2017 tweet from the president. “After consultations with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,” Trump wrote. “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.
