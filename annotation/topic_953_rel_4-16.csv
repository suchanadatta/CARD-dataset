"HONG KONG — President Trump railed against a lot of things in 2017. Chinese construction in the South China Sea was not really one of them, despite his campaign tough talk. Focused on North Korea and evidently enamored of President Xi Jinping, the voluble U.S. president said relatively little as China continued to build on disputed islands, rocks and reefs.  A recent Chinese report hailed progress in the South China Sea last year, noting construction totaling 290,000 square meters, or 72 acres. That included work on hangars, missile shelters and large radar and sensor arrays, according to satellite images reviewed by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a U.S. think tank.  China claims nearly all of the South China Sea. In 2016, an international tribunal ruled against those claims, but the finding has largely been ignored — both by the Philippines, which brought the case, and by Beijing. Having added thousands of acres to the Spratly Islands in recent years, China is now building out bases there. Once operational, these outposts will enable the Chinese military to better patrol the South China Sea, potentially changing the regional balance of power. It is both a territorial dispute and a test of regional influence, with an increasingly assertive China often appearing to set the terms.  Though Chinese reclamation and building predate Trump, many expected the Republican president to push back more forcefully than the previous administration.  The National Security Strategy released last month does say China's ""efforts to build and militarize outposts in the South China Sea endanger the free flow of trade, threaten the sovereignty of other nations, and undermine regional stability."" But experts see few signs the issue is a White House priority. ""Nobody in the White House is super focused on South China Sea stuff, at least as far as we know,"" said Julian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University School of Law and an expert on the South China Sea. ""I think it's going to remain on the back burner, and that's definitely going to help the Chinese."" The administration's quiet approach gave China a ""free pass"" in 2017, ceding ground at a critical time, said Jay L. Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea.  ""If China does base ships there and move in weapons, it will complete their planning, it will make permanent their dominance of the South China Sea,"" he said. ""Because once they do that, they won't be pulling back."" In 2018, that may create new challenges for Trump. As a candidate, Trump cast China as an always-winning upstart that ought to be cut down to size. China will ""go in the South China Sea and build a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen,"" he warned in 2016. ""Because they have no respect for our president and they have no respect for our country.""  But in his first year in office, Trump has been the one showing respect, heaping praise on China's authoritarian president. A readout from his November visit with Xi said Trump raised the issue of the South China Sea, but he did not stress it publicly. In Vietnam, Trump casually offered to mediate — though there did not seem to be any takers.  The president's approach so far has been to regularize the type of Freedom of Navigation Operations, or FONOPs, that the Obama administration authorized in 2015. May saw the first FONOP of the Trump era, when a destroyer, the USS Dewey, sailed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands. There have been several since. A spokesman for the National Security Council said the FONOPs program challenges excessive maritime claims by various states to preserve free movement on the sea and in the air. The problem, experts said, is that FONOPs have thus far failed to stop Chinese building — and are therefore unlikely to stop whatever comes next. ""FONOPs are not a full strategy,"" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  ""It was not enough in the Obama era and it's not enough under Trump,"" Glaser said. Though Trump has given no clear signs that he plans to make the South China Sea a priority in 2018, his hand may be forced.  The president's push to get China to rein in North Korea is not going according to plan. He has said as much on Twitter. In the months ahead, he will probably face pressure to take a tougher line with Beijing. ""We know that the Pentagon, unlike the Trump administration, is very much worried about the South China Sea,"" said Richard Javad Heydarian, a Manila-based security analyst. ""The Pentagon is looking at options to bring the fight to the Chinese and up the ante there."" The question is what the Chinese side does next.  Most experts say they believe China will press ahead with both civilian and military building projects. Having constructed facilities for planes and ships, it may soon start rotating them through on a regular basis. Beijing could declare what are known as ""straight baselines"" in the Spratlys. These are in effect perimeters connecting the outermost points of a group of islands, turning the sea within into ""internal waters."" In the case of the Spratlys, straight baselines would enclose features occupied by other nations.   China declared straight baselines in the Paracel island chain in 1996 and has in recent years signaled that it may do so in the Spratlys, a move that would be hotly contested and would almost certainly draw a U.S. response. A less likely scenario would be Beijing beginning to dredge near Scarborough Shoal, a disputed, U-shape reef not far from the Philippine coast. Since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016, China has held off land reclamation there. If the Xi-Duterte truce falls apart, Beijing could decide to start, crossing what has long been seen as a U.S. red line. Any of these moves would require the United States to rethink the status quo and take South China Sea strategy off ""autopilot,"" said Glaser of CSIS. ""There is not enough thinking about what the U.S. will do to deter or respond to what will be the next Chinese actions in 2018,"" she said.  emily.rauhala@washpost.com"	782	"[{""start"": 1018, ""end"": 1173, ""text"": ""Once operational, these outposts will enable the Chinese military to better patrol the South China Sea, potentially changing the regional balance of power."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1471, ""end"": 1714, ""text"": ""The National Security Strategy released last month does say China's \""efforts to build and militarize outposts in the South China Sea endanger the free flow of trade, threaten the sovereignty of other nations, and undermine regional stability.\"""", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2311, ""end"": 2523, ""text"": ""If China does base ships there and move in weapons, it will complete their planning, it will make permanent their dominance of the South China Sea,\"" he said. \""Because once they do that, they won't be pulling bac"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	760	2023-04-27T10:04:09.557402Z	2023-04-27T10:04:09.557490Z	0.78
CHINA Mattis warns Beijing of consequences Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday raised the prospect of additional U.S. steps against China if its “militarization” of the South China Sea keeps apace. He said Beijing is intimidating and coercing others in the region by putting weapons systems on man-made islands. Mattis, speaking at an international security forum in Singapore, said the Trump administration’s recent decision to disinvite China from a multinational naval exercise this summer was an “initial response” to Beijing’s island activity. He called the U.S. action a “relatively small consequence” and said he believes “there are much larger consequences in the future.” China has recently deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers and other equipment on the Spratly Islands, and it landed a bomber aircraft at Woody Island in the South China Sea, in territorial waters claimed by multiple nations. China’s reliance on military muscle to achieve its goals “is not a way to make long-term collaboration the rule of the road in a region that’s important to China’s future,” Mattis said, when asked to elaborate. “There are consequences that will continue to come home to roost, so to speak, with China, if they don’t find a way to work more collaboratively with all of the nations who have interests,” he said. Mattis also said, however, that the United States welcomes cooperation with China “wherever possible,” and he announced that he has accepted Beijing’s invitation to visit soon. It was not immediately clear whether that invitation would stand after the annual Shangri-La Dialogue. Senior Col. Zhao Xiaozhuo said a U.S. move to send two warships into China’s “territorial waters” was a violation of law and an “obvious provocation to China’s national security and territorial integrity.” — Associated Press American killed in Nicaragua violence: Nicaraguan authorities say a U.S. citizen has been killed in the streets of Managua as violence and social unrest continue to grip the capital. The Legal Medical Institute said Sixto Henry Vera was found beside two burned out vehicles with a bullet wound to the head. Employees at the Managua bar that Vera owned say he left Friday evening to help a friend who was under attack. The U.S. Embassy confirmed that Vera was a U.S. citizen. More than 110 people have been killed in Nicaragua during clashes between forces loyal to President Daniel Ortega and opposition groups. Nationalists in Catalonia regain control of province: Nationalists in Spain's wealthy Catalonia region have regained control of the regional government and are pledging to seek independence, posing a swift challenge to new Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who also took office Saturday. The new Catalan cabinet was sworn in after months of tensions with the central government, ending Madrid's seven-month direct rule of the region, imposed by Sánchez's predecessor after separatists declared independence. Al-Shabab retakes town in central Somalia: Somalia's militant Islamist group al-Shabab has retaken a small town in the center of the country after it was abandoned by government troops, residents said. Fighting broke out in the town of Muqokori, about 185 miles north of the capital, Mogadishu, late Friday, almost a month after government troops ousted the insurgents. Burma willing to take all Rohingya back, minister says: Burma is willing to take back all 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled to Bangladesh if they volunteer to return, the country's national security adviser, Thaung Tun, says. While speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, he was asked if the situation in Burma's Rakhine state, where most Rohingya live, could trigger use of the Responsibility to Protect framework of the United Nations. Castro to preside over Cuban constitutional convention: Cuban legislators took the first step Saturday toward drafting a new constitution. President Miguel Díaz-Canel convened a special session of Cuba's parliament to propose a list of people to undertake a rewrite of the Soviet-era document. Delegates gave their approval for a commission presided over by former president Raúl Castro and composed of about 30 others, including Díaz-Canel. — From news services	781	"[{""start"": 203, ""end"": 315, ""text"": ""He said Beijing is intimidating and coercing others in the region by putting weapons systems on man-made islands"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	759	2023-04-27T10:04:06.664783Z	2023-04-27T10:04:06.664890Z	0.763
"New images taken just this week show China building what look like military bases on reclaimed land in the South China Sea, a development likely to add to concerns in the United States and among its Asian neighbors. China said on Tuesday that land reclamation had now finished on ""some islands"" in the South China Sea. But the focus is now likely to shift to the construction work that China is carrying out, which many fear will lead to further militarization of the South China Sea. Images taken as recently as June 28 show how China has almost completed the construction of an airstrip at Fiery Cross Reef. The images were taken by DigitalGlobe and supplied to The Post by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Land reclamation is now complete at Fiery Cross Reef. AMTI says construction of the air base is continuing “with ongoing paving and marking of the airstrip, an added apron, construction of a sensor array and development of additional support facilities.” This image also shows a naval vessel docked at the island. Images at Johnson South Reef show what looks like a significant military monitoring station. According to AMTI, features here include: a small port with limited berth space and two loading stations, two helipads, three possible satellite communication antennae, one large multi-level facility, two possible radar towers under construction, six possible security and surveillance towers for weapons and or sensors, four possible weapons towers, a lighthouse, a possible solar farm with 44 panels and two wind turbines. See our full package of images showing China's land reclamation and construction activity here. AMTI Director Mira Rapp-Hooper says the facilities have “all the trappings” of military capabilities and applications and would improve China’s ability to monitor other nations’ activities in the disputed Spratly Islands. The construction work, she says, “is going to be the new diplomatic challenge, not just for the United States, but also for all the regional countries which have been very keen to deter China from militarizing the islands.” On June 16, China’s Foreign Ministry announced that the land reclamation work on some islands in the South China Sea would be completed in the near future and that it would now begin to build more infrastructure on the islands. On Tuesday, it confirmed the land reclamation “on some islands” was now complete. It says that infrastructure will mainly be for civilian purposes but acknowledges it will also be used for “military defense.” That does not reflect a change in policy but simply an acknowledgement of the fact that the project to stake China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea more forcefully had moved onto a new phase, experts say. Although AMTI says land reclamation does appear to have finished on five of the seven islands, other images taken between June 5 and 10 – and available on the AMTI Web site — show reclamation work still continuing on two islands, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef. China claims almost the entire South China Sea but faces rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Beijing says it is merely playing catch-up to other claimants that have established bases on other islands and reefs in the past, but the United States says it fears China will use its new facilities to bully smaller nations. Last week, Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China’s actions in the South China Sea pose a “threat to peace and stability” and compared them to Russia’s in Ukraine. Both, he said, were “efforts to unilaterally and coercively change the status quo — transgressions that the United States and our allies stand united against.” Russia has seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and sent in troops to support a civil war in eastern Ukraine that has left thousands of people dead. On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said changing position on China's claims over the South China Sea would shame its ancestors, while not facing up to infringements of Chinese sovereignty there that would shame its children. ""One thousand years ago China was a large sea-faring nation. So of course China was the first country to discover, use and administer the Nansha Islands,"" Wang said, using the Chinese term for the Spratly Islands. ""China's demands of sovereignty over the Nansha Islands have not expanded and neither will they shrink. Otherwise we would not be able to face our forefathers and ancestors,"" he said, according to Reuters. Wang said China could not face its children and grandchildren if ""the gradual and incremental invasion of China's sovereignty and encroachment on China's interests"" was allowed to continue."	741	"[{""start"": 1708, ""end"": 1929, ""text"": ""AMTI Director Mira Rapp-Hooper says the facilities have “all the trappings” of military capabilities and applications and would improve China’s ability to monitor other nations’ activities in the disputed Spratly Islands."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3196, ""end"": 3420, ""text"": ""Beijing says it is merely playing catch-up to other claimants that have established bases on other islands and reefs in the past, but the United States says it fears China will use its new facilities to bully smaller nations"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	719	2023-04-26T14:30:08.283678Z	2023-04-27T10:01:12.616262Z	272.73400000000004
ABOARD THE USS RONALD REAGAN — As fighter jets roared off the flight deck and darted above the South China Sea, visitors onboard the carrier USS Ronald Reagan raised their phones for the inevitable selfies. Among those clicking souvenir images was a lieutenant general from the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, who was part of a VIP guest list as the carrier moved through contested waters. The carrier — which docked last week in Hong Kong in a good-faith gesture from Beijing — also offered a snapshot into challenges for the Pentagon in the Asia-Pacific region as China builds up its own naval prowess and ramps up efforts to solidify territorial demands. The United States seeks to keep its place as the dominant naval power across East Asia, where Washington and its allies believe Beijing is trying to reorder international rules and military alliances in place since World War II. But Washington also has to contend with China’s fast-growing military reach. That includes investments to its navy and missile systems to directly counter American military might. Few places display Beijing’s ambitions more clearly than in the South China Sea. China has built a number of artificial structures and begun to militarize them. Western military analysts say China is able to possibly position missiles that could potentially destroy American aircraft carriers and other warships. China claims it has historic rights to these waters, a crucial waterway where one third of global trade flows. The United States and its allies, meanwhile, view the South China Sea as a vital international maritime corridor. Nations bordering the sea, including the Philippines, look to the U.S. Navy to help defend their access. The United States has historical alliances in the Pacific that offer some advantage. But the Belt and Road Initiative — a grand plan of investment and construction across Asia and beyond — is widely seen as a way to chip away at the U.S. bonds in the region by trading economic favors for influence. Trade issues are expected to dominate planned talks later this week between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit of Group of 20 industrialized nations in Buenos Aires this week. But military concerns, including China’s expansion into the South China Sea, have raised alarm in Washington. Speaking at a regional summit in Singapore this month, Vice President Pence said these seas do not “belong to any one nation” and reaffirmed American military commitment to the region — but analysts say this is getting harder to do as China builds up its own arsenal. “There’s a need for the U.S. to recognize that China’s growing diversity and range of missiles is going to complicate anything we seek to do in any contingency, be it in the South China Sea, or with Taiwan or North Korea,” said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst who specializes in the Indo-Pacific region at the Rand Corp. A recent Rand study found the Chinese navy during the past two decades caught up to the United States by modernizing “extraordinarily quickly by any reasonable historical standard.”  “In basically every category, China has narrowed the gap [with the United States] significantly,” Grossman added.  A bipartisan committee created by Congress also concluded in a report that the United States has lost its military edge and could lose in a potential war with Russia or China. In a speech Nov. 17, Adm. Phil Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, identified China as perhaps the greatest challenge to the “long-term stability” of the region. He referred to Beijing’s infrastructure building across Asia as “insidious” debt-trap diplomacy and accused China of intimidating countries in the region by militarizing these seas. China, he added, has built a “Great Wall of SAMs” — surface-to-air missiles — that has the “potential to exert national control over international waters and airspace.” These have been built on artificial islands China constructed in the South China Sea, where the Philippines, Vietnam and others also have claims of sovereignty, backed by international law.  China has rejected a 2016 ruling by an international court that invalidates its claims to the sea. At the same time, Beijing has long objected to this heavy American military presence in these waters. As the USS Reagan and another aircraft carrier were conducting drills off the coast of the Philippines last week, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said pointedly that military actions under the “pretext freedom of navigation” undermine the sovereignty of countries around the South China Sea.  “We have asked the U.S. side or those claiming that there are problems with the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea many times to produce a single piece of evidence to prove which ship or plane from which country has encountered problems,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Nov. 16. “However, up to now, no one can give us a clear-cut answer.”  Aside from land missiles, China is developing its own aircraft carriers — a move directly aimed at competing with the United States, which has 11. But it has a long way to go. The one Chinese aircraft carrier in service, the Liaoning, is under maintenance. A second is conducting trials, and a third is in the pipeline.  “We have been operating aircraft carriers for an awful long time; we’re pretty good at it,” Rear Adm. Karl O. Thomas, commander of the Reagan strike group, said in an interview. “It will take [the Chinese] some time to get there,” he added.  Collin Koh, an expert on Chinese maritime strategy at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, said the Chinese navy continues to face difficulty in recruiting pilots. “The U.S. Navy carrier has been a result of decades of experience; it is a gap that China can’t necessarily bridge within a short span of time and hone it to a level comparable to the U.S.,” he said.  The Chinese navy, he adds, has had no combat experience for three decades, and technology such as its anti-ship ballistic missiles has not been tested.  The Chinese lieutenant general invited on board, Tan Benhong, the commander of the PLA garrison in Hong Kong, had an amicable exchange with his counterparts.  “We had a great meeting with them when they came onboard,” said Thomas. “We have the opportunity to show our contemporaries how we operate our aircraft carrier.”  But just last month, a Chinese warship came within 45 yards of a U.S. destroyer as it sailed past the Chinese-claimed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, almost causing a collision.  “There are long-standing differences that China and the U.S. have on military activities in each other’s waters,” said Koh, who describes them as “structural.” “I think it is quite clear that they aren’t able to resolve this in the coming time.”  shibani.mahtani@washpost.com   	780	"[{""start"": 568, ""end"": 659, ""text"": ""China builds up its own naval prowess and ramps up efforts to solidify territorial demands."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3593, ""end"": 3773, ""text"": ""e referred to Beijing’s infrastructure building across Asia as “insidious” debt-trap diplomacy and accused China of intimidating countries in the region by militarizing these seas"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4234, ""end"": 4335, ""text"": ""At the same time, Beijing has long objected to this heavy American military presence in these waters."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	758	2023-04-27T09:28:58.324115Z	2023-04-27T09:28:58.324185Z	544.863
At last week’s Munich Security Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo observed that China has had border disputes with almost all its neighbors. Specifically, he said that “China has had a border or maritime dispute with nearly every nation bordering it.” This statement is accurate; China has been involved in border and maritime disputes with all its neighbors. But Pompeo’s statement also suggests that China is still embroiled in territorial conflicts with nearly all its neighbors, posing a threat to the West and to the world. This part of his speech discussed nations that “don’t respect sovereignty” and who view territorial integrity with “contempt,” and his remarks focused on Russia and Iran in addition to China. However, China’s approach to territorial disputes has been quite different from what Pompeo suggests. Here’s what you need to know. China has resolved most of these disputes Over the past 70 years, China has had territorial disputes with each of its neighbors — in some cases, especially with the former Soviet republics, multiple disputes. China has also contested the sovereignty of three island groups — the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea and the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea — as well as an island in the Tonkin Gulf. And Beijing has claimed sovereignty over Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as part of the homeland territory of the People’s Republic of China. All told, as my book shows, China has been involved in 23 unique territorial disputes since 1949. Today, only six of these disputes remain: Taiwan, the border with India, the border with Bhutan and three island group disputes. China’s other territorial disputes have been resolved. These include all disputes with North Korea, Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar and Laos as well as the land border dispute with Vietnam and White Dragon Tail Island in the Tonkin Gulf. China settled the disputes over Hong Kong and Macao by negotiating the return of colonial territories from Britain and Portugal, respectively. However, the resolution of the other disputes involved compromise agreements in which China received only part of the contested territory. In some cases, China offered substantial compromises, in excess of 50 percent of the disputed land. Compromising over territory was a strategic move China could have demanded much more. But by compromising, China traded some of the contested territory for improved relations with its neighbors, especially on its continental frontier. China often wanted improved relations during periods of intense internal insecurity, such as rebellion in Tibetan areas in the late 1950s or the domestic political upheaval after the demonstrations and massacre in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989. In return, China’s neighbors also received recognition of their sovereignty from Beijing. Moreover, the settlement of these disputes has created stability. China has not reopened any of the compromises spelled out in these treaties or border agreements. Beijing has not reneged on the territorial delimitations contained in these agreements. Even though the Qing dynasty encompassed several million square kilometers more than the PRC today, China has not pursued new irredentist claims in adjacent states. Importantly, China has also not been involved in armed conflicts or crises with any neighbor after the settlement of their territorial disputes. China’s remaining disputes present real challenges Territorial disputes are volatile, prone to escalation to armed conflict. As scholars John Vasquez and Marie Henehan conclude, nations are more likely to fight over disputed territory than any other issue. The six disputes that remain, especially Taiwan, are contentious and could easily escalate. China has used force in the majority of these outstanding disputes, including a 1962 war with India, multiple crises across the Taiwan Strait in the 1950s and 1990s, and the seizure of islets in the Paracel and Spratly Islands in 1974, 1988 and 1994. The disputes that remain encompass territory that is most valuable for material, strategic or nationalist reasons. The Chinese leadership views achieving Taiwan’s unification as a sacred task, a goal enshrined in the PRC constitution. In a January 2019 speech, for example, Xi Jinping warned that unification should not be “dragged on generation after generation.” Furthermore, he underscored that China would not “renounce the use of force” and would “reserve the option of taking all necessary means.” Claims to the offshore island groups matter for several reasons. They help China project power and a robust maritime presence within the littorals of East Asia. They also serve as one basis for claiming maritime boundaries and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (though a 2016 arbitral tribunal ruled that none of the land features in the Spratly Islands can generate an EEZ). More generally, as China’s power has grown in the past decade, its ability — and willingness — to assert and press its claims in these outstanding disputes has grown. Leader Xi Jinping has taken a much harder line, stating in 2018 that “any inch of territory passed down from ancestors cannot be lost.” In the East China Sea, China since 2012 has conducted regular patrols within the territorial waters of the Senkaku Islands under Japanese administration and maintained an almost continuous presence nearby. In the South China Sea, China has reclaimed land on the seven reefs it occupies, transforming three into well-fortified forward operating bases capable of hosting significant air and naval assets. More recently, China has spurned the arbitral tribunal’s ruling regarding historic rights by using its coast guard to pressure Vietnam over hydrocarbon development within Hanoi’s EEZ and to enforce its claims to historic rights within Indonesia’s EEZ. Across the Taiwan Strait, Beijing has increased military pressure. Since 2016, China has conducted “island encirclement” exercises, using military aircraft to fly around Taiwan’s perimeter. Earlier this month, China held a joint air and naval exercise off Taiwan’s southeast coast, practicing air-to-ground strikes. Are there more compromises ahead? China has used force in some of these territorial disputes, while pursuing negotiated settlements through compromise agreements in others. The scope for compromise has narrowed in its remaining disputes and, of course, is unlikely over Taiwan. These conflicts will be a critical factor in shaping regional stability. But by settling the majority of its other territorial disputes, China and its neighbors have reduced numerous opportunities for armed conflict. Don’t miss anything!

The Pentagon disinvited China from participating in a major naval exercise on Wednesday, signaling mounting U.S. anger over Beijing’s expanded military footprint in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department had withdrawn an earlier invitation to the Chinese navy to participate in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) drill, a biennial naval exercise that involves more than two dozen nations, over Beijing’s decision to place anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and electronic jammers on the Spratly Islands. Those islands, which China has enlarged and occupied in recent years, are subject to competing claims from several countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines. “We believe these recent deployments and the continued militarization of these features is a violation of the promise that President Xi [Jinping] made to the United States and the world,” Logan said in a statement. The Pentagon said that China has also landed bomber aircraft, apparently including the advanced, nuclear-capable H-6K, at Woody Island, in another disputed area to the north claimed by China and Vietnam. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Wednesday, called the decision “unconstructive.” “We hope the U.S. will change such a negative mind-set. Both China, the U.S. are big countries, and we are well positioned to have greater cooperation at sea,” Wang said at a news conference. “China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands. That is the right to self-defense and preservation of every sovereign state.” The decision to exclude China from the exercise is likely to intensify tensions with a country the Pentagon has identified, along with Russia, as a chief rival to American military power and a focus of planning. While the U.S. and Chinese militaries coordinate in some areas, the United States has expressed concern about China’s growing arsenal of sophisticated weapons and its attempt to project its might across Asia and beyond. While the Trump administration does not back any of the rival claims to the islands and smaller features, it has insisted on freedom of navigation and challenged Chinese assertions of sovereignty over virtually all the South China Sea, which U.S. allies in the region see as key to their economic interests and security. Patrick Cronin, an Asia scholar at the Center for a New American Security, said the move was a “welcome slap” on the wrist in response to China’s buildup in contested waters and its decision to largely ignore a 2016 ruling challenging its maritime claims. “China’s militarization of the South China Sea deserves to be penalized, not rewarded,” he said. The Pentagon’s decision may presage a harder line than the Trump administration has previously taken on the South China Sea dispute. “We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,” Logan said. China’s exclusion comes a month before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is due to make his first official visit to China. It is not clear how the RIMPAC decision, which was authorized by Mattis, may affect that trip. Cronin said the decision was unlikely to alter China’s plans for the South China Sea. “China’s response will be to adjust its information warfare, but China’s strategy will remain on course, unperturbed by U.S. actions thus far,” he said. The move occurs at a delicate moment for U.S. strategy in Asia, just weeks ahead of a planned summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over that country’s nuclear program. Ahead of the talks, the United States needs Beijing, North Korea’s chief economic backer, to maintain pressure on Pyongyang. A Pentagon official said that China was notified about its exclusion from the exercises, which last about a month, on Wednesday morning. Beijing began participating in the exercise in 2014. missy.ryan@washpost.com	778	"[{""start"": 1519, ""end"": 1686, ""text"": ""China is only building civilian and some necessary defense facilities on our own islands.

BEIJING — Signs that China may be contemplating another bout of island-building in the South China Sea ahead of an important U.N. ruling on the issue have provoked the United States to step up its vigilance in the region in recent days. Twice last week, and again Tuesday, the U.S. Pacific Command said it sent warplanes close to Scarborough Shoal, a triangular chain of coral reefs, sand and rocks close to the Philippines coast. In Beijing, the response was sharp. The shoal is the latest point of friction between China and the United States and nations that ring the South China Sea over Beijing’s moves to build maritime outposts and other installations that could have a potential military use. “Thunderclouds are gathering over the South China Sea, and China is the lightning rod,” said Carlyle Thayer, emeritus professor of politics at the University of New South Wales in Australia. China seized Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines in 2012 and appears to be considering whether to build an artificial island there, experts say. It has already constructed or reclaimed seven islands in the nearby Spratly chain. Work on the shoal would be another major step in China’s apparent drive to cement long-term control of the South China Sea and would significantly heighten regional tensions. It would also bring China’s military close to U.S. military bases in the Philippines. A key ruling on the Chinese action by a panel of jurists at a U.N.-appointed tribunal in The Hague, expected in coming weeks, is driving the unease in Beijing, experts suggest. “It’s believed that the rulings will be unfavorable to China, and there are concerns that other countries like the United States and Japan will take this opportunity to further challenge China’s territorial claims in the area,” said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing. Shi predicts that China could respond by starting dredging work this year on the shoal, which it calls Huangyan Island; circumstantial evidence backs up that argument. In February, a plan to expand the shoal into an island with a runway, harbor, town and resort surfaced on a Chinese website dedicated to military issues. Although a similar, albeit less-detailed, image circulated in 2012, some observers took its reappearance as a sign the issue was under consideration. In March, the U.S. Navy chief, Adm. John M. Richardson, told Reuters that the military had observed Chinese shipping activity around the shoal, including possible survey work, suggesting that it could be “the next possible area of reclamation.” On Monday, the South China Morning Post quoted an unnamed source “close to” the Chinese navy as saying Beijing would carry out “land reclamation” on the shoal this year. None of this is conclusive, experts warn. Mira Rapp-Hooper, of the Center for a New American Security, said intense efforts were underway to dissuade Beijing from taking a step that Washington could see as “very escalatory.” It would also constitute a significant violation of a 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, experts said, although that agreement between China and rival Asian claimants has often been ignored. “It would be the final nail in that agreement’s coffin,” said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea and insists that all disputes with rival claimants must be settled bilaterally. But the Philippines took Beijing to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague after the seizure of Scarborough Shoal, insisting that China had breached international law. It also argues that China has unlawfully blocked Philippine fishermen from the shoal’s vicinity and has failed to preserve the marine environment there. In anticipation of the ruling, China has been active diplomatically, enlisting Russia’s support for its position and reaching an accord Tuesday with Indonesia on enhanced security and marine cooperation. On Sunday, China also reached what it called an “important consensus” with Cambodia, Laos and Brunei that the dispute should not affect its relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “China is trying to preemptively divide ASEAN, so when the ruling comes down, there won’t be a united or firm ASEAN statement supporting the ruling against China,” said Yanmei Xie, senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group. Washington has not stood still either, recently announcing a permanent military presence on five bases in the Philippines and starting joint naval patrols in the South China Sea. The latest U.S. airborne missions involved four A-10C Thunderbolt II aircraft, flying from Clark Air Base in the Philippines, and came just after 11 days of military exercises between the two countries. “Our job is to ensure air and sea domains remain open in accordance with international law,” Air Force Col. Larry Card, commander of the Pacific Command’s Air Contingent, said in a statement. “Free trade depends on our ability to move goods.” China says its actions pose no threat to commercial shipping, and it accuses Washington of undermining regional peace and stability. “Huangyan Island is China’s inherent territory, and the Chinese military will take all necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and security,” China’s Defense Ministry said Monday. “The United States is promoting militarization of the South China Sea in the name of ‘Freedom of Navigation,’ ” the statement added. If China moves to build a military base on Scarborough Shoal, the site would form a strategic triangle with Chinese-controlled islands in the Spratly and Paracel chains. It would also help China monitor U.S. military activity in the Philippines’ Subic Bay, just 150 nautical miles to the east. “It would bring U.S. and Chinese forces into close proximity, with all the attendant risks that that entails,” Storey said. What is less clear is how the United States could prevent such a move without escalating confrontation with China. Actions such as deploying destroyers to block Chinese dredgers, taking Manila’s side on the sovereignty issue or extending the reach of Washington’s military treaty with the Philippines to include the shoal would not be taken lightly by Beijing. “A political decision would have to be made that Chinese reclamation on Scarborough is unacceptable,” said Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But do we really want to draw a red line here? And what would the U.S. do if the Chinese simply went ahead anyway?” Dan Lamothe in Washington and Emily Rauhala and Xu Yangjingjing in Beijing contributed to this report.	777	"[{""start"": 1123, ""end"": 1297, ""text"": ""Work on the shoal would be another major step in China’s apparent drive to cement long-term control of the South China Sea and would significantly heighten regional tensions."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1298, ""end"": 1382, ""text"": ""It would also bring China’s military close to U.S. military bases in the Philippines"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1562, ""end"": 2053, ""text"": ""It’s believed that the rulings will be unfavorable to China, and there are concerns that other countries like the United States and Japan will take this opportunity to further challenge China’s territorial claims in the area,” said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing.

by Simon Denyer and Thomas Gibbons-Neff (May 10, 2016) The U.S. military has returned to Philippine bases, angering China The Philippines' relationship with China was further complicated this year when the island nation inked the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the United States, allowing the U.S. military to build facilities at five Philippine bases. China’s posture is bringing the Philippines and the United States back together. This year, the Philippines moved forward with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, which allows the U.S. military to build facilities at five Philippine bases and is likely to mean more hardware at Subic Bay, which is now technically a commercial, not a military port. That means U.S. and Chinese ships sailing in close proximity, deepening an already tense and dangerous standoff. For the Philippines, it raises tough questions about how the next administration should balance big powers while protecting Philippine sovereignty and fragile economic gains. With China pressing south, U.S. ships return to the Philippines’ Subic Bay, by Emily Rauhala (May 6, 2016) China rejects arbitration and has been lining up supporters Well before the international tribunal in The Hague issued its ruling, Beijing rejected the arbitration and said it would ignore the court’s decision. China also began lining up countries to support its stance over the sea, and it claims as many as 60 countries are siding with Beijing in the dispute. The numbers are questionable, and the idea of gaining the support of distant, landlocked Niger in a dispute about the South China Sea could seem faintly ludicrous. Yet China’s frantic efforts to rally support ahead of a ruling from an international tribunal in The Hague may not be as meaningless as they might seem. Cold, hard Chinese cash and what many see as American double standards are undermining efforts to build a unified global response to Beijing’s land reclamation activities in the disputed waters and employ international law to help resolve the issue. The lure of Chinese money is having an impact in the Philippines, where President-elect Rodrigo Duterte has made wildly contradictory comments on the issue but has suggested some openness to bilateral negotiations — if China builds railways there.

BEIJING — Hundreds of rocky islands, islets, sandbanks, reefs and cays lie scattered across Asia’s eastern waters, unimportant-looking to the naked eye but significant enough to spark what may be the most worrying deterioration in U.S.-China relations in decades. China’s military rise, and its increasingly assertive claims to sovereignty over these largely uninhabited lumps of rock, coral and sand, have set it on a possible collision course with its neighbors, which also make various claims on the archipelagos, and with the United States, which has important alliances with three of the rival claimants and would be obliged to defend them in the event of an attack. As Chinese and Vietnamese ships ram each other in the contested waters, and Chinese and Japanese fighter jets play games of chicken in Asia’s disputed skies, the risk of military escalation is growing. Even more significantly, the standoff is generating bad blood between Washington and Beijing and could torpedo cooperation on important global issues, including the Middle East, climate change and nuclear proliferation. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will visit Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday for the sixth annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue. And while Washington has been focused more on Iraq, Syria, Ukraine and Russia, some say the U.S.-China relationship is facing its stiffest test since President Richard M. Nixon traveled to Mao Zedong’s China in 1972. “U.S.-China relations are worse than they have been since the normalization of relations, and East Asia today is less stable than at any time since the end of the Cold War,” said Robert Ross, a political science professor at Boston College and associate of Harvard’s John King Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies. The Obama administration’s foreign policy rebalance, or“pivot,” to Asia has been widely interpreted in China as an attempt to contain its rise. U.S. efforts to bolster ties with regional states such as Vietnam and to reassure nervous Asian allies such as Japan and the Philippines that it stands ready to defend them militarily have created a new narrative in Beijing — that the United States has encouraged China’s neighbors to push their territorial claims more aggressively. “It is clear that the disputes are between two sides, but the United States is taking sides, and it is not impartial,” Adm. Sun Jianguo, deputy chief of the general staff of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, said in an interview. In Washington, a rival narrative is taking hold: that China is intent on pushing its territorial claims through the threat of military force and that it ultimately wants to push the United States out of Asia. There have been more intense crises in U.S.-China relations, including the fallout from the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy protesters, but none, perhaps, as fundamental and structural as this. In November, China spooked its neighbors by announcing an air defense identification zone over the East China Sea, including over islands administered by Japan. In March, the Chinese coast guard tried to block Philippine vessels from resupplying soldiers stationed on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. Two months later, it deployed a $1 billion deep-sea oil drilling rig into disputed waters off the Vietnamese coast. It has also been building artificial islands in the South China Sea that U.S. officials say are meant to enhance its stance on sovereignty. China says it has historical claims to a huge swath of the South China Sea, but its recent assertiveness has puzzled experts, appearing to undermine last year’s efforts to promote a more cooperative, development-focused relationship with its neighbors. Some argue that President Xi Jinping may see external threats as useful in ushering in tough reforms, including of the military; others say that China is simply baring its fangs as it seeks to build a new Asian order in which it, not the United States, is the major player in the region. Most agree, though, that China is asserting itself partly because it now possesses a modern deep-water navy and professional coast guard. Whatever the reason, China’s rise has left the United States caught between its commitments to allies and its desire to maintain a constructive relationship with China. In recent months, it has seemed to emphasize the former, sending B-52 bombers to fly through China’s air defense zone and threatening to reevaluate its military posture in Asia if China extends the zone to the South China Sea. In April, President Obama visited U.S. allies Japan, South Korea and the Philippines in a trip that pointedly excluded China. While in Japan, he became the first president to explicitly say that the U.S. defense treaty covered islands administered by Japan. In the Philippines, he signed a new 10-year defense agreement. There has been an equal and opposite reaction from Beijing. When U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel implicitly accused China in May of “intimidation, coercion or the threat of force” in asserting its territorial claims and warned that the United States “will not look the other way when fundamental principles of the international order are being challenged,” Lt. Gen. Wang Guanzhong called Hagel’s comments “excessive” and “suffused with hegemony, incitement, threats and intimidation,” China Central Television reported. Daniel Russel, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, argues that the blunt exchanges between the countries could be beneficial. “It is an indication of health, I believe, that we are able to be so direct with China, without fearing that we are tanking the relationship or the prospects for cooperation,” he said in an interview. “We do not pull our punches, but at the same time, we are working hand in hand in China wherever we can.” Some critics say that the United States should have been more assertive in forging closer economic links with Asia through a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and with China through a bilateral investment treaty. “We need a lot more weight on the economic side, because that’s what keeps your relationship from tipping into a Cold War relationship,” said Christopher Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Also fueling China’s adventurism is a feeling among some Chinese officials that the United States is inconsistent and lacks resolve. They point to the administration’s unwillingness to punish Syria for using chemical weapons and its failure to prevent the Russian move into Crimea as showing it to be a “paper tiger,” said Johnson, the CIA’s former top China analyst, who is in regular contact with Chinese officials. “They believe Obama is fundamentally weak and disinterested,” he said. But, Johnson added, Beijing would be wrong to underestimate the U.S. commitment to defend Asia. “America is a sleeping giant,” he said, “and if you prod us too hard, we are going to mobilize.” Either way, foreign policy experts agree that the relationship deserves much more attention than it is getting. Kerry is widely seen as more interested in the Middle East, while national security adviser Susan E. Rice has yet to visit Beijing, leaving China policy without a sufficiently senior voice in Washington. Meanwhile, Obama’s refusal to visit China for a return version of last year’s Sunnylands summit in California with Xi has also “personally irritated” his Chinese counterpart, Johnson said — although he is scheduled to visit Beijing for an Asia-Pacific summit in November. With that visit, at least, and with this week’s Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the administration has a chance to focus minds on one of its most serious foreign policy challenges, experts say. “Summits,” said Ross, of Boston College, “have the value of making presidents pay attention.” Gu Jinglu contributed to this report.	772	"[{""start"": 672, ""end"": 872, ""text"": ""As Chinese and Vietnamese ships ram each other in the contested waters, and Chinese and Japanese fighter jets play games of chicken in Asia’s disputed skies, the risk of military escalation is growing"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 672, ""end"": 872, ""text"": ""As Chinese and Vietnamese ships ram each other in the contested waters, and Chinese and Japanese fighter jets play games of chicken in Asia’s disputed skies, the risk of military escalation is growing"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2501, ""end"": 2709, ""text"": ""In Washington, a rival narrative is taking hold: that China is intent on pushing its territorial claims through the threat of military force and that it ultimately wants to push the United States out of Asia."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4326, ""end"": 4552, ""text"": ""In recent months, it has seemed to emphasize the former, sending B-52 bombers to fly through China’s air defense zone and threatening to reevaluate its military posture in Asia if China extends the zone to the South China Sea."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	750	2023-04-27T08:57:02.257625Z	2023-04-27T08:57:02.257694Z	638.888
On Wednesday, General Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, remarked that despite assurances that there would be no moves to militarize the South China Sea, China had built “10,000-foot runways, ammunition storage facilities” — and routinely deployed aviation and missile defense capabilities. U.S. naval vessels operating in East Asia report being shadowed and harassed by China’s maritime forces. The Royal Australian Navy flagship Canberra also reported a recent encounter in the South China Sea while trailed by a Chinese warship: Its helicopter pilots were hit with lasers from what appeared to be fishing vessels. To put these and other recent events in context, I reached out to two experts: Andrew S. Erickson, a professor at the Naval War College’s China Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI) and a visiting scholar at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, and Ryan D. Martinson, a researcher at CMSI. They are the editors of the book “China’s Maritime Gray Zone Operations” (U.S. Naval Institute, 2019). What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation: Jessica Chen Weiss: The trade war has dominated headlines in U.S.-China relations, but what’s the state of play between the United States and China in the South China Sea? How has China’s artificial enlargement of islands and reefs affected U.S. operations and interests? Andrew S. Erickson and Ryan D. Martinson: While tariff disputes dominate world news, territorial disputes in the South China Sea remain a key flash point in U.S.-China relations. Beijing maintains a claim to all of the space within a “dashed line” enclosing most of the South China Sea — including hundreds of tiny islands and reefs. China also believes it has the right to engage in military, scientific and economic activity anywhere within this zone, and to limit at least some these same activities by other countries. Over the last decade or so, Beijing has vigorously asserted these claims. Instead of using its navy, it has relied on coast guard and maritime militia forces, operating in the “gray zone” between war and peace. The biggest losers in China’s maritime gray zone campaign have been China’s neighbors. In 2012, Beijing succeeded in wresting a disputed feature from the Philippines. This was also a very big deal for the United States — the Philippines is a treaty ally. China’s coercion at sea also directly threatens U.S. interests in maritime freedom. Under international law, naval vessels can freely operate anywhere outside of the territorial sea. China rejects that consensus and periodically harasses U.S. Navy vessels for exercising these rights. U.S. interests in the South China Sea range from very specific concerns about freedom of navigation to much broader concerns about the diminution of U.S. influence in a strategically vital region. The U.S. Navy helps defend these interests, patrolling the South China Sea to demonstrate Washington’s support for its allies and partners. These patrols are sometimes punctuated by “freedom of navigation operations” — actions designed to challenge China’s excessive claims. The most significant recent development is China’s construction of enormous new facilities on the seven features that it occupies in the Spratly Archipelago. A few years ago, these were tiny outposts with zero combat power — with perhaps a few dozen soldiers who could barely keep their feet dry. Since 2013, China has transformed them into gigantic bases, some with air stations able to accommodate advanced fighters and bombers. Last year, China installed missiles capable of sinking warships and shooting down aircraft hundreds of miles away. Given the power advantages that China already possesses compared with other South China Sea claimants, the only plausible logic for constructing these bases was to alter the military balance of power with the United States. Naturally, these new bases have become a huge source of tension between the United States and China. JCW: The U.S. Navy recently warned that it would treat Chinese coast guard and paramilitary vessels the same as the Chinese navy. What’s behind this development? ASE/RDM: The U.S. Navy recognizes that China has not one but three sea forces, which act increasingly in coordination. Within that division of labor, China’s navy has sought prestigious engagement and substantive learning opportunities with the U.S. Navy as Beijing’s “good cop” at sea, while China’s coast guard and maritime militia “bad cops” bully its neighbors over disputed features and waters and harass the U.S. Navy’s own ships. But now the days of Washington letting Beijing have it both ways are over. U.S. officials have been making similar statements for months now — then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in November called for China’s maritime militia to “operate in a safe and professional manner in accordance with international law.” Assistant Defense Secretary Randall Schriver made a similar statement in a December interview. Their statements built on reports from the Pentagon and other agencies that exposed the maritime militia’s military nature and activities. These efforts to treat China’s three sea forces holistically and oppose their gray zone expansionism draw substantially on research conducted at CMSI over the past five years. 3. China has pursued a variety of coercive, competitive activities short of using force in the South China Sea. Which of these “gray zone activities” will the United States be more likely to succeed at deterring, and which will the United States probably have to live with? ASE/RDM: That’s a great question, and one that Michael Mazarr addresses in our new book. Not every element of China’s maritime gray zone campaign threatens vital U.S. interests. The U.S. government clearly does not feel responsible for protecting Vietnamese fishermen in the Paracels, which Beijing has controlled since 1974. However, the U.S. does have a vital interest in deterring China from taking control of any more features occupied by the U.S.-allied Philippines. China’s seizure of Scarborough Reef in 2012 probably could have been avoided had Washington played a more active, determined role before and during the crisis. In 2014, it looked like China might try to annex another Philippine-occupied feature — Second Thomas Shoal. The U.S. took a much more proactive approach and may have convinced Beijing to stand down. Washington has demonstrated the capacity to deter Beijing from limiting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and is poised to continue doing so. It has likewise continued to deter China from dredging and building even the smallest of installations at Scarborough. China uses coercion to dissuade other states from enforcing their legitimate rights and interests within their own coastal waters. A 2016 court decision completely nullified the nine-dash line as a basis for China’s maritime claims. That means China unequivocally has no right to prevent the Philippines from exploiting seabed resources within 200 nautical miles of its coast — or any reason to harass Philippine fishermen plying these same waters. This applies to other countries bordering the South China Sea. The results of the 2016 decision can help Washington consider ways of helping its allies and partners defend their coastal-state rights from China’s maritime gray zone actions.

"BEIJING — China and the United States have been trading accusations as both sides conduct war games across East Asia, and tensions are rising from the South China Sea to the East China Sea to the Korean Peninsula in the midst of a regional arms race. At the heart of the tensions lies the maritime territorial dispute in the South China Sea, as well as a growing divide on how to respond to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, infecting China’s relations with South Korea, Japan and the United States. Yanmei Xie, senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group (ICG) in Beijing, says China’s relations with its neighbors have deteriorated significantly, as the region continues to engage in an arms race. “Before, the region was in the process of economic integration, the building of multilateral institutions, and regional governance by consensus,” she said. “But in recent years, that has all been unraveling. In its place you have an arms race and the building-up of deterrents and the fracturing of multilateral institutions. It’s not good.” Xie said Beijing and Washington have radically different explanations for the deterioration in the regional security environment. “If you ask China, it’s because of the U.S. pivot to Asia. If you ask anyone else, it’s because of the emergence of a more assertive China,” she said. Here is a look at some of the current hot spots: Korean Peninsula On Monday, about 25,000 U.S. troops began annual military exercises with South Korea, a move that has prompted warnings of retaliation from North Korea. China’s state news agency, Xinhua, joined the condemnation on Monday, saying the move would “jeopardize peace and stability in Northeast Asia” and could even inadvertently provoke a real war. Xinhua said U.S. “muscle-flexing” and South Korea’s resolve to counter its northern neighbor will “lead to a vicious circle of violence for violence” and warned that “improper handling” of the military drills could lead to fighting. The U.S.-led U.N. Command Military Armistice Commission said it had notified the North Korean army that the drills were “non-provocative” in nature. But North Korea, as it often has in the past, denounced them as preparation for invasion and threatened a preemptive nuclear strike. “The nuclear warmongers should bear in mind that if they show the slightest sign of aggression, it would turn the stronghold of provocation into a heap of ashes,"" a North Korean army spokesman said in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Tensions are running high, with China objecting fiercely to the deployment of a sophisticated U.S. missile defense system to South Korea. China says the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) unit will harm regional stability. Beijing is worried that the system could be used to monitor and counter not only North Korea but also China's missiles. In July, the Defense Ministry in Beijing said it was pressing ahead with tests for its anti-missile system. South China Sea Chinese coast guard ships conducted live-firing exercises Monday in the Gulf of Tonkin, a body of water between northern Vietnam and southern China, the latest military drill in the area since an arbitration panel in The Hague invalidated much of China’s claims to the disputed waters of the South China Sea. China also plans military exercises with Russia in the South China Sea next month, a move that the United States said would harm regional stability. “There are other places those exercises could have been conducted,” Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said on a visit to China this month. “So I think that is a matter of concern that should be considered from the perspective of actions that are not increasing stability in the region.” Meanwhile, China has continued to develop its outposts on the disputed Spratly Islands, despite the arbitration panel ruling, as it seeks to change the facts on the ground, experts say. Satellite photos released by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington showed that China was in the process of building reinforced hangars beside the three runways it has constructed in the Spratlys, with space for 24 fighter jets and three to four larger planes. East China Sea China also staged military exercises in the Sea of Japan last week, including a simulated bomber attack on a naval task force, the military said. The Sea of Japan is also known as the East Sea. Indeed, a mild rapprochement between Japan and China has unraveled in recent weeks, partly a spillover in tensions from the South China Sea. That is partly because Beijing objected to Tokyo’s support for the ruling issued in The Hague, ICG’s Xie said. Even before the ruling was announced, Beijing’s ambassador to Tokyo warned Japan that it would “cross a red line” if its Self Defense Forces took part in U.S.-led “freedom of navigation” exercises in the South China Sea, the Kyodo news agency reported. China, Xie says, resents it when the United States plays a role in the South China Sea but can just about accept it. However, the Communist Party is much less able to appear “weak-kneed” in front of a domestic audience when it comes to responding to criticism from Tokyo, she said. Now, the tension appears to be spilling over into the East China Sea. China has objected to Japan’s reported plans to deploy new surface-to-ship missiles to islands in the East China Sea. Japan, in turn, lodged protests this month after Chinese fishing and coast guard vessels intruded in what Tokyo considers to be its territorial waters around disputed islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. The foreign ministers of China, Japan and South Korea are to meet in Tokyo on Tuesday and Wednesday in hopes of calming regional tensions."	770	"[{""start"": 2533, ""end"": 2669, ""text"": ""ensions are running high, with China objecting fiercely to the deployment of a sophisticated U.S. missile defense system to South Korea"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2533, ""end"": 2669, ""text"": ""Tensions are running high, with China objecting fiercely to the deployment of a sophisticated U.S. missile defense system to South Korea"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	748	2023-04-27T08:38:57.610226Z	2023-04-27T08:38:57.610307Z	313.365
BEIJING — China said it was “deeply concerned” on Wednesday about a reported U.S. proposal to consider sending naval ships and aircraft toward man-made islands in the South China Sea as tensions escalate between the two nations over the vital waters. The Obama administration has looked on with mounting frustration in recent months as China has undertaken a vast program of land reclamation in the South China Sea, turning rocks and submerged reefs into islands capable of supporting airstrips and military facilities across some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The fear, expressed by President Obama last month, is that China is using its “muscle” to bully smaller nations into accepting its sovereignty over disputed waters. But a volley of verbal protests from the United States has fallen on deaf ears, and administration officials have been agonizing over how to rein China in without escalating military tensions to dangerous levels, experts say. Until now, Washington has also appeared reluctant to impose real costs on Beijing over the issue and risk damaging other aspects of a wide-ranging bilateral relationship, foreign policy experts say. But the administration now appears to be seeking other options to counter the threat that China’s assertive — and at times aggressive — stance poses to vital U.S. interests. “Reclamation isn’t necessarily a violation of international law, but it’s certainly violating the harmony, the feng shui, of Southeast Asia, and it’s certainly violating China’s claim to be a good neighbor and a benign and non-threatening power,” Daniel Russel, assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said in a telephone interview. With Secretary of State John F. Kerry due in Beijing on Saturday, a high-level dialogue between the two nations scheduled for June in Washington and Chinese President Xi Jinping paying a state visit to the United States in September, Russel said there were still plenty of diplomatic avenues open to influence China’s decision-making. “Not every problem is best dealt with by imposing harsh and heavy consequences,” he said. “But sure, we are looking at the options available to us if persuasion and diplomacy doesn’t work.” However, persuasion is not working, many experts say, and there are not many other easy options available. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has been among those advocating a more robust response but has not made many concrete suggestions, apart from disinviting China from the Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, military exercise in 2016. “That would be water off a duck’s back to Beijing,” said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. He said China would send ships to carry our surveillance activities anyway, as it has in the past. Another idea mooted by the Pentagon and first reported in the Wall Street Journal this week is to send U.S. naval ships and aircraft within 12 nautical miles of some of the man-made islands in the South China Sea to demonstrate the principle of freedom of navigation and underline that the United States does not accept China’s maritime claims — even if it does not endorse the territorial claims of rival nations. As it does for a range of regional developments, the U.S. Pacific Command has drawn up contingency plans related to China’s buildup of artificial islands in the South China Sea, U.S. defense officials said. The plans have not yet been examined at the most senior levels of the Obama administration, and officials said there had been no decision to immediately deploy assets near the artificial islands. Because the islands are in international waters, U.S. planes or ships could transit near them as a matter of course, the officials said. Military and foreign policy analysts in Beijing, Washington and Manila said actions of this nature would not force China to halt its reclamation work or the construction of military, surveillance and other facilities on reclaimed land. But they said it might be seen as a way to send a stronger signal to Beijing and to reassure Asian allies and partners of Obama’s commitment to regional security. “There is a bit of arrogance here in Beijing with respect to Southeast Asian nations, but they are watchful of their relationship with the United States,” said Yanmei Xie, senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group. “Until recently it appeared that China had gotten away with it. It seems the United States has struggled to come up with responses that could be effective but not escalatory — and China has not felt any tangible consequences.” In 2013, China spooked the region and the United States by unilaterally declaring an air defense identification zone over much of the East China Sea, including over islands controlled by Japan. The United States responded by flying two B-52 bombers through the zone to underline that it did not recognize its legality. Sending ships and planes toward newly constructed islands might serve a similar purpose. But it would not be without risks. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying expressed “deep” concern about the idea Wednesday and requested a clarification from the United States. “The Chinese side advocates the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, yet the freedom definitely does not mean that foreign military vessels and aircrafts can enter one country’s territorial waters and airspace at will,” she told a regular news conference. “. . . We urge parties concerned to be discreet in words and actions, avoid taking any risky and provocative actions and safeguard regional peace and stability.” Storey said China would probably respond to any such actions by sending civilian coast-guard vessels up against U.S. warships in an attempt to portray the United States as the bully. There was also a risk, he said, of aggressive maneuvers between U.S. and Chinese warships. In 2001, a midair collision between a U.S. surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter caused the death of a Chinese pilot and raised tensions between the two nations. In 2013, the USS Cowpens was forced to take sudden evasive action in the South China Sea when a Chinese naval vessel objected to its intelligence-gathering activities in international waters. Still, some say the Pentagon’s suggestion is a good one, especially as the risks of less concrete action are mounting. “The risk of damage to tranquil U.S.-China relations is high,” said Walter Lohman, director of the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation. “But in my opinion, that's a risk we have to run.” Russel, the assistant secretary of state, said China’s reclamation work was already raising regional tensions and could further militarize the region. China’s bases on these islands could be used to block “rightful uses of international waters” by other nations, he warned. Fishing, surveillance activities, and oil and gas exploration by any number of countries could all be threatened if China uses bases on these new islands to mount more aggressive patrols, experts say. Chinese bases would also make any future plan to impose an air defense identification zone over the South China Sea more credible, said Chris Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The PLA [People’s Liberation Army] have made it very clear they will declare one some day,” he said. “It is a question of when, not if.” Gu Jinglu and Xu Yangjingjing in Beijing and Missy Ryan in Washington contributed to this report.	769	"[{""start"": 621, ""end"": 733, ""text"": ""is that China is using its “muscle” to bully smaller nations into accepting its sovereignty over disputed waters"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2668, ""end"": 2766, ""text"": ""He said China would send ships to carry our surveillance activities anyway, as it has in the past."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6705, ""end"": 6826, ""text"": ""China’s bases on these islands could be used to block “rightful uses of international waters” by other nations, he warned"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6828, ""end"": 7233, ""text"": ""Fishing, surveillance activities, and oil and gas exploration by any number of countries could all be threatened if China uses bases on these new islands to mount more aggressive patrols, experts say.

BEIJING — China is building a “Great Wall of sand” through an unparalleled program of land reclamation in the South China Sea, raising concerns about the possibility of military confrontation in the disputed waters, according to the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In one of the strongest and highest-level criticisms of the reclamation project to date, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. told a naval conference in Australia late Tuesday that competing territorial claims by several nations in the South China Sea continue to stoke “regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation.” “But what’s really drawing a lot of concern in the here and now is the unprecedented land reclamation currently being conducted by China,” he added. Satellite images show rapid construction on various coral reefs and rocks controlled by China within the disputed Spratly Islands, including harbors, piers, helipads, buildings and potentially at least one airstrip, experts say. Last month, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki expressed concerns that the program was an attempt to “militarize outposts on disputed land features.” Harris said that China has created 1.5 square miles of artificial landmass in recent months. “China is building artificial land by pumping sand onto live coral reefs — some of them submerged — and paving them over with concrete,” he said. In a region known for its beautiful natural islands, he said, “China is creating a Great Wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months.” China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its territorial waters, but its claims overlap with those of Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. Last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that the country was merely carrying out “necessary construction on its own islands and reefs” and that it would continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the busy shipping waters of the South China Sea, as well as resolve disputes through “direct dialogue” and consultation. “The construction does not target or affect anyone,” he said at a news conference. “We do not accept criticism from others when we are merely building facilities in our own yard. We have every right to do things that are lawful and justified.” State news agency Xinhua was more forthright in rejecting U.S. criticisms last month, accusing Washington of displaying a “perverted sense of insecurity” and a “pirate-style mindset.” While China’s attention was focused elsewhere in previous decades, the other major claimants to the Spratly Islands occupied various islands and rocks throughout the archipelago, building ports, piers, bases and airstrips there. China now appears to be rushing to underline its own claims. “This history matters a great deal, because what Washington and its friends and allies may see as punctuated, lightning-speed construction is likely viewed in China as a perfectly legitimate game of catch-up,” Mira Rapp-Hooper, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative and a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), wrote in a recent report. “What sets China’s activities apart, however, is that Beijing has been dramatically changing the size and structure of existing physical land features, while other claimants have built upon or modified existing land masses,” she wrote in a related report. The only major claimant without an airstrip in the archipelago, China appears to be turning the hitherto largely submerged Fiery Cross Reef into the largest island in the Spratly Islands, experts said. Yanmei Xie, senior China analyst with the International Crisis Group in Beijing, said the island reclamation project was a deliberate strategic decision. “Although China’s exact intention is unclear so far, they are likely mainly designed to extend China’s power projection, by expanding, for example, its surveillance, early warning and air interception capabilities further out into the sea,” she said. “With these added capabilities, China could have a de facto ‘air defense identification zone’ in the South China Sea, even though it may not rush to declare one out of concern for the political and diplomatic fallout.” China provoked strong U.S. criticism when it unilaterally declared an air defense identification zone over disputed waters in the East China Sea in 2013, and Secretary of State John F. Kerry was among those who warned Beijing not to do the same for the South China Sea. Harris said that the pace of China’s construction of artificial islands “raises serious questions about Chinese intentions.” He added, “How China proceeds will be a key indicator of whether the region is heading toward confrontation or cooperation.” Foreign-policy experts said China’s activities would not reinforce its legal claims to the islands under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea because only natural land features are relevant to maritime rights. But it could help China enforce de facto control of some of the disputed waters. Chris Johnson, a senior CSIS adviser, said that China had carried out more reclamation work on the islands in the past five months than other claimants had done in the past five years. “They want to be able to operate with impunity in these waters, and they want the rest of us to accept it,” he said. “So what does the game plan ultimately entail? Is it to be able to move around in these areas and operate, and by doing so, in a de facto manner, emphasize their claims? Or do they have intent, over time, to kick rival claimants off?” he asked. “I don’t think there’s a sense of that, but I do think their behavior suggests they are moving in one direction, and they expect the other claimants to respect their growing power.” Liu Liu contributed to this report.

China has finished its first airstrip in the hotly-contested Spratly Island chain in the South China Sea, according to new satellite photos released by IHS Janes. The airstrip, located on Fiery Cross Reef, is more than 3,000 meters long and appears to be complete due to the new presence of runway heading markings and helipad designators. Fiery Cross is just one of three reefs in the Spratly group of islands that China has built airstrips on. Currently, airstrips of the same length are under construction on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef. [China appears to be building another airstrip in the South China Sea] According to IHS Janes, a defense analysis company, the completion of the runway indicates that China will soon be able to ferry in more supplies and start air patrols over the disputed island chain. At 3,000 meters long the airstrip can accommodate most Chinese military aircraft, and once the other two airstrips are completed, China will be able to fly near-constant air patrols over the South China Sea. The islands, once small strips of sand barely above sea level, have been built up in past years as China, using international maritime law, has sought to claim the waters around the islands as their own. Photos: China’s rapid island-building strategy continues The airstrips are particularly worrying to the Philippines, as they have claimed various islands in the Spratly group as their own. As both the Philippines and China have claimed some of the same territory, close encounters with each other’s navy is an almost daily occurrence. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims to various parts of the South China Sea, which for all of the claimants, is an important maritime trade route. While the airstrip on Fiery Cross is a first in the Spratly group, it is not the first airstrip completed in the South China Sea. The Chinese have an airstrip on Woody Island as well.

Marine biologist John McManus, who has been studying Pacific coral reefs for the past 30 years, remembers a two-day boat journey a few years ago to a remote part of the Spratly Islands, a chain of low-lying coral and rocky reefs in the South China Sea. “You are traveling along in open ocean waters, then you come upon a place where the waves are breaking, then everything beyond the reef is flat, like a giant pool,” said McManus, who is director of the National Center for Coral Reef Research at the University of Miami. Today, seven such coral reefs are being turned into islands, with harbors and landing strips, by the Chinese military. Not only is this work threatening China’s relations with the United States and several other Pacific nations, it is also destroying a rich ecological network, according to McManus. “This is devastating,” he said. “It’s the worst thing that has happened to coral reefs in our lifetime.” U.S. officials estimate that the Chinese military has built up the shallow tropical seafloor with reclaimed sand, steel, wood and concrete barriers to create 2,000 acres of new territory. Chinese officials have said that “rigorous” testing is done before any construction to protect the reef environment and that beyond military uses the created islands will improve China’s capabilities for “search and rescue at sea, fishing security, disaster prevention and relief, and meteorological monitoring.” While China’s construction has raised tensions in the region, it is also provoking questions about how long these bases will be able to withstand the severe storms that are frequent in that part of the Pacific Ocean. “You can build an island if you do it right,” said Robert Dalrymple, a professor of civil engineering at Johns Hopkins University. “But it is not clear these islands will be permanent unless they can deal with erosion. They will wash away, just like putting sand on East Coast beaches.” Artificial islands have been built for coastal resorts or airports in shallow waters off Florida, the Caribbean, the Arabian Sea and many other areas. The Philippines and Vietnam have erected outposts — many of them on wooden stilts — in the South China Sea in the past two decades in an effort to support territorial claims. But the Chinese efforts dwarf these projects. At some of the new islands, the Chinese are building concrete breakwaters hundreds of feet long to hold the sand in place. Dalrymple has visited construction projects in China and says the country clearly has the engineering expertise to handle huge amounts of dredged material. Other experts say that the Chinese are working quickly, rather than carefully, to create the artificial islands. “The engineering feats are incredible in terms of speed,” said Patrick Cronin, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. Cronin has been briefed on the island-building by senior U.S. officials. “They have not only doubled the land mass . . . but [also] have created forward staging bases of both military and civilian use. Dredging machines didn’t just build islands, but also dug deeper shipping channels.” The results can been seen in unclassified satellite images posted by the Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, another think tank. Time-lapse images show coral rings in an azure sea being filled in by white sand dredged from the nearby seafloor, followed by the arrival of construction cranes, workers and then multistory buildings. Among the projects described on the CSIS site are: ● An airstrip almost two miles long on Fiery Cross Reef. ● Radar facilities and a helipad on Cuarteron Reef. ● A new dock and gun emplacements on Gaven Reef. ● Expansion on Hughes Reef from an outpost on stilts measuring less than a tenth of an acre to a 380-acre multilevel facility and harbor for both civilian and military ships. ● Dredging at Mischief Reef, which lies within what the Philippines considers its economic zone with floating naval docking stations. ● New piers, access channel and possible landing strip at Subi Reef. ● Desalination pumps and a concrete plant on Johnson South Reef. While the artificial islands seem solid in the satellite images, the Pacific Ocean isn’t always peaceful, says Steve Elgar, a senior scientist in ocean physics and engineering at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Woods Hole, Mass. He wonders how long they will survive the wind-driven waves, some as high as 30 feet, that develop far out at sea and then roll in with no landmass to stop them. Such rocky islands as Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines are surrounded by coral reefs that help break up the force of waves traveling across the ocean. But the new bases in the Spratlys don’t have that protection. “They are in the middle of the ocean, 1,000 miles from north to the south,” Elgar said. “With these huge fetches [distances that wind blows unobstructed over water], they have got to get big waves just from the wind blowing. They are exposed out in the middle of nowhere.” Other ocean scientists worry about the effect of dredging and island creation on surrounding marine life. The Spratlys contain major fishing grounds for several Asian nations, and the local marine biodiversity has been on the decline for the past two decades, according to a 2013 study by Australian and Chinese scientists. The report, which appeared in the journal Conservation Biology, found that coral cover had declined to about 20 percent (from about 60 percent) within the Spratly archipelago over the preceding 10 to 15 years. “Climate change has affected these reefs far less than coastal development, pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices,” according to the report, which warned that the declines in the reefs were “unfolding as China’s research and reef-management capacity are rapidly expanding.” Greg Mitchell, a professor of marine ecology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., researches Pacific reef ecosystems. He says the new Chinese dredging and installation of concrete piers are probably destroying what’s left of the local ecology. “If the islands had been left alone, they would probably be very diverse,” Mitchell said. “But all of the fishing fleets from Asia have been there hunting everything from sea cucumbers and giant clams and sharks for fins. My guess is the biodiversity has been altered already. But now, they are burying the ecosystem and destroying it.” Niiler is a freelance writer based in Maryland.	766	"[{""start"": 1116, ""end"": 1428, ""text"": ""Chinese officials have said that “rigorous” testing is done before any construction to protect the reef environment and that beyond military uses the created islands will improve China’s capabilities for “search and rescue at sea, fishing security, disaster prevention and relief, and meteorological monitoring."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3748, ""end"": 3920, ""text"": ""Expansion on Hughes Reef from an outpost on stilts measuring less than a tenth of an acre to a 380-acre multilevel facility and harbor for both civilian and military ships."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	744	2023-04-27T08:08:52.637673Z	2023-04-27T08:08:52.637795Z	552.165
Was this a prelude to a major escalation in the South China Sea, or is the Trump administration having trouble articulating its foreign policy? On Monday, new White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the United States would prevent China from taking over territory in international waters in the South China Sea. His comments were widely interpreted as doubling down on remarks by Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, on Jan. 11 that the United States would not allow China access to islands it has built in the South China Sea, and upon which it has installed weapons systems and built military-length airstrips. “The U.S. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there,” Spicer said when asked if President Trump agreed with his nominee. “It’s a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper, then yeah, we’re going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country.” Experts had initially thought Tillerson might have misspoken, but Spicer's remarks appeared to raise the likelihood that the administration was indeed considering blocking China's access to its new islands in the Spratlys. China’s Foreign Ministry reacted calmly to Tillerson’s remarks last week, declining to be drawn into how it would react in a “hypothetical” situation. On Tuesday, it said it had “non-negotiable sovereignty” to the Nansha — or Spratly — islands and surrounding areas, and added it insisted on solving disputes through peaceful bilateral negotiations with other countries in the region. “The United States is not a country directly involved in the South China Sea,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference. “We urge the United States to respect facts and speak and act cautiously to avoid damaging peace and stability in the area.” Last week, state-run China Daily dismissed Tillerson’s remarks as “not worth taking seriously because they are a mishmash of naiveté, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices and unrealistic political fantasies.” But nationalist tabloid the Global Times warned that any move to blockade the islands could provoke a “large-scale war.” That is an assessment broadly shared by many foreign policy experts. Mira Rapp-Hooper, a South China Sea expert at the Center for a New American Security, called the threats to bar China's access in the South China Sea “incredible” and told Reuters it had no basis in international law. “A blockade — which is what would be required to actually bar access — is an act of war,” she added. Chen Xiangmiao, a research fellow at the National Institute for the South China Sea, said Spicer appeared to have kept the same “hard-line attitude” displayed by Tillerson and Trump before his inauguration and during the campaign. “Trump is the president now; he is no longer in the campaign phase, and what he said may actually be put into practice,” he said. “China needs to be more alert.” Chen said what worried experts here was “whether Trump and his team truly understand the South China Sea issues, whether they truly understand China’s stance and situation and whether they truly understand America’s interests in that area.” Trump himself has criticized China for building what he called a “massive fortress” in the South China Sea. But what exactly does he want to do about it? There is confusion in foreign policy circles. Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was quoted as saying last week that she had heard from some members of the Trump transition team that Tillerson “misspoke” during five hours of Senate testimony. But on Monday she told Reuters that Spicer’s remarks were “worrisome” and more evidence of “confusing and conflicting messages.” As Chinese media have pointed out, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia also control islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, yet the United States is not demanding they leave the area. Asked how the United States would enforce any move against China, Spicer seemed keen to change the subject, saying only: “I think, as we develop further, we’ll have more information on it” — before turning to another question. As Bill Hayton, an associate fellow at Chatham House and South China Sea expert, pointed out in a piece for Foreign Policy last week, there are different interpretations of what the new administration might be thinking. One is that Tillerson can be taken both seriously and literally: that the United States government will attempt a blockade as a way to force Beijing to respect last year’s ruling by an international tribunal that China’s claim to the waters encompassed by its “nine-dash line” was not supported by the international law of the sea. A blockade would be an attempt to force China to allow other nations more freedom to fish and drill for oil in the disputed waters, and “above all, give up any attempts to block U.S. naval ships transiting, exercising, or gathering intelligence in the South China Sea,” Hayton wrote. Indeed, that is one of the main bones of contention between Washington and Beijing over the vital waterways. Chinese think tanks complain that U.S. military vessels and aircraft are conducting operations and reconnaissance missions close to its shores more and more frequently. Beijing insists it will allow commercial shipping free passage but clearly believes the U.S. Navy should stay out of its back yard, and it seized an American underwater drone in the South China Sea last month apparently to make that point. The United States says its navy has the right to sail in international waters. But as Hayton pointed out, a U.S. attempt to enforce its position through a blockade could provoke military conflict and lose the support of American allies in Asia keen to avoid a superpower confrontation. Yet there is another possibility: that Tillerson and Spicer are in fact indirectly referring to concerns about Scarborough Shoal, a partly submerged chain of reefs and rocks close to the Philippines that China seized in 2012. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is among those who have warned that China was planning to build a military base on Scarborough Shoal, to form a triangular network when combined with existing bases in the Spratly and the Paracel islands. The Obama administration, Hayton pointed out, was reported to have told China in 2016 it was prepared to physically deter any attempts to build on the shoal, and had deployed ships and aircraft to the area to back up that threat. An attempt to stop China building a new island on Scarborough Shoal would imply greater continuity with policy under Obama, and be less confrontational than preventing China’s navy from getting access to existing islands. Indeed, Beijing knows that any attempt to build a new island on the Shoal would be provocative in itself. “Tillerson may therefore have been simply stating that he wants this strategy to continue — stopping any island-building on Scarborough Shoal by denying construction vessels access to it,” Hayton wrote. Dean Cheng, a China expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told Reuters the administration had left open the possibility of economic measures — instead of military steps — against China and firms that carry out island building. Yet given a chance this week to clarify where his government stands on the South China Sea, Spicer appears to have muddied the waters still further.

"BEIJING – China criticized U.S. “hegemony and hypocrisy” on Tuesday after a top U.S. admiral vowed to continue naval patrols in the South China Sea. On a visit to China, the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. Harry Harris Jr., defended last week’s decision to sail a U.S. naval destroyer close to a Chinese-occupied island in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, and reiterated that such patrols would continue — despite Beijing’s intense displeasure. Harris, speaking at the Stanford Center at Peking University, tried to play down the dispute by stressing deepening cooperation between the two nation’s militaries, including joint participation in regional military exercises and a coordinated naval search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 last year. “Some pundits predict a coming clash between our nations. I do not ascribe to this pessimistic view,” he said. “While we certainly disagree on some topics — the most public being China’s claims in the South China Sea and our activities there — there are many areas where we have common ground.” The United States and its regional allies have become increasingly concerned about China’s efforts to build artificial islands on rocks and reefs in the South China Sea, and to construct airstrips and surveillance equipment on those islands. In April, Harris said China was building a “Great Wall of Sand” there. Last week’s action by the USS Lassen was designed to show that the United States would not tolerate any interference with freedom of navigation in nearby waters. Harris said Monday he continues to have “personal and candid conversations” with Chinese military leaders about tension in the South China Sea. He also described China’s claims to almost all of the South China, encompassed by its “nine-dash line,” as both “ambiguous” and a challenge to the “rules-based international order.” But he tried to characterize last week’s mission by the U.S. destroyer as routine. “Our military will continue to fly, sail and operate whenever and wherever international law allows. The South China Sea is not — and will not — be an exception,” he said. “I truly believe that these routine operations should never be construed as a threat to any nation.” A Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details, said the Lassen had also sailed past four islets or reefs held by Vietnam or the Philippines last week before it went past the Chinese-held Subi reef. However, the attempt by Harris to defend U.S. actions met a fierce rebuttal from China, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accusing the United States of “plain provocation."" With 100,000 ships passing through the South China Sea safely every year, it was a “false proposition” to argue freedom of navigation was threatened, she said. The United States has been strengthening its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region and holding frequent military exercises with China’s rivals, while hyping the threat from China, Hua told a daily news conference.

The U.S. Navy has dispatched an aircraft carrier and several ships accompanying it into the South China Sea in the last few days, a deployment of thousands of U.S. sailors to a region a top U.S. admiral said last week is increasingly militarized by China. The USS John C. Stennis, the carrier, arrived in the South China Sea on Tuesday, Navy officials said. It is accompanied by the cruiser USS Mobile Bay and the destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Chung-Hoon, said Navy Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for U.S. Pacific Fleet. The ships arrived in the Western Pacific on Feb. 4 on a deployment from the West Coast of the United States. Doss said the carrier is carrying out a routine patrol of the South China Sea, where China has in recent weeks moved Chinese fighter jets, military radar and surface-to-air missiles. The Navy will continue to appear in the South China Sea regularly, Doss said. Pacific Fleet ships spending a combined 700 days there last year. [China testing Obama as it expands its influence in the South China Sea] Aside from the carrier group, the Japan-based USS Antietam, a cruiser, also is currently patrolling the South China Sea, Doss said. The USS McCambell, a destroyer, and the USS Ashland, an amphibious dock landing ship, completed similar patrols last week. It is not clear if or when any of the ships will complete any freedom of navigation patrols. The Navy has carried out two controversial ones in the South China Sea since October, using destroyers to sail within 12 nautical miles of artificial islands claimed by China. Beijing has claimed the surrounding waters as its own, but the Pentagon has said it will continue to sail through them because they have long been considered international waterways.

BEIJING — China is adding new antiaircraft weapons to a string of artificial islands in the middle of the disputed South China Sea, according to a report by U.S. policy-watching groups based on satellite analysis. The findings, drawn from a study by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, appear to challenge vows by China’s leader last year not to “militarize” the area. In recent years, Beijing has turned scattered coral reefs into small, strategic outposts by piling sand and then building installations such as barracks, lighthouses and military-grade airstrips. China claims sovereignty over the full South China Sea — in direct conflict with international rulings and other countries bordering the sea, including the Philippines and Vietnam. In a recent television interview, President-elect Donald Trump accused Beijing of building a “massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea.” Beijing maintains that these seven artificial islands serve civilian, not military, purposes. China’s Defense Ministry said in a statement published Thursday that any “necessary military facilities” were for “defense and self-defense” and were, therefore, “legitimate.” “If someone shows off his muscles in your doorway,” the statement said, “shouldn’t you at least prepare a slingshot?” The “muscle,” in this case, is the United States. Though Washington says it has no position on rival sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, the United States has been critical of China’s island-building and conducts patrols — officially called “freedom of navigation operations” — in the area. China sees the presence of U.S. ships as interference and has repeatedly said that it is the United States, not China, that wants to militarize the South China Sea. The standoff has been a long-standing source of tension between Washington and Beijing, and nobody seems certain how Trump and his team will handle the dispute. On one hand, Trump has talked of putting “America first” and focusing more on domestic matters. On the other, his advisers have criticized the Obama administration’s “limited” response to China’s maritime claims. The Chinese side, for its part, appears to be pushing ahead with its strategy of gradually adding new military features to the artificial islands. The report by the U.S. groups found that weapons systems spotted on the three largest islands China has built in the Spratlys — Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs — were an “evolution” of smaller systems previously seen on four other sites in the sea. The placement of the weapons showed that Beijing “is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,” the report said. “They would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these soon-to-be-operational air bases.” There was no immediate U.S. response to the report. In a speech in Sydney on Wednesday, Adm. Harry Harris, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, suggested that the United States is ready to “confront” China at sea. “I’ve also been loud and clear that we will not allow the shared domains to be closed down — no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South China Sea,” he said. “I say this often, but it’s worth repeating — we will cooperate where we can and be ready to confront where we must.” Luna Lin in Beijing contributed to this report.  	761	"[{""start"": 958, ""end"": 1051, ""text"": ""Beijing maintains that these seven artificial islands serve civilian, not military, purposes."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1052, ""end"": 1225, ""text"": ""China’s Defense Ministry said in a statement published Thursday that any “necessary military facilities” were for “defense and self-defense” and were, therefore, “legitimate"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2584, ""end"": 2757, ""text"": ""The placement of the weapons showed that Beijing “is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,” the report said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2760, ""end"": 2911, ""text"": ""They would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these soon-to-be-operational air bases."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2760, ""end"": 2911, ""text"": ""They would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others against these soon-to-be-operational air bases."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	739	2023-04-27T07:36:49.101126Z	2023-04-27T07:36:49.101195Z	168.801
BEIJING — The United States is very concerned about China’s growing militarization of the South China Sea and intends to have a “very serious conversation” with Beijing after reports emerged that it had deployed suspected ­surface-to-air missile batteries on a disputed island, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Wednesday. “There is every evidence, every day that there has been an increase of militarization of one kind or another,” Kerry told reporters when asked about the reported deployment, agencies reported. “It’s of serious concern.” “We have had these conversations with the Chinese, and I am confident that over the next days we will have further very serious conversation on this,” Kerry said. Satellite images apparently showing the missile sites were released as President Obama wrapped up a summit with leaders from nations making rival maritime claims in the region. The report has heightened concern not just in the United States but also in Asia about Beijing’s expanding ambitions in the region. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said in a statement it “grasped that Communist China had deployed” missiles on Woody Island in the Paracel chain and urged “relevant parties to refrain from any unilateral measure that would increase tensions.” Taiwan’s statement followed a report on Fox News on Tuesday that was based on satellite images acquired by a private company. Navy Cmdr. Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman, said Wednesday evening that the photos supported reports of a deployment. “Commercial imagery indicates that China has deployed a surface-to-air missile system on a disputed outpost in the South China Sea,” Urban said. “We are concerned that these actions are increasing tensions in the region and are counterproductive.” The Paracel Islands have been under Chinese control for more than 40 years but are also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. The reported Chinese move followed a U.S. naval operation in which a missile destroyer sailed close to another island in the Paracels last month. The South China Sea, bordered by China and a number of Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, has been the center of rising tensions since Beijing began expanding its foothold in the region last year. China has built seven artificial islands in the Spratly chain in the South China Sea and constructed airstrips on three of them, prompting worry in the West about possible military intent. But China argues that other nations in the region have also built airstrips and reclaimed land. At a news conference Wednesday, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said he had only just been told of the reports but suggested they were an attempt by “certain Western media to create news stories.” He also drew attention to lighthouses, meteorological stations, and shelter and rescue facilities that China has built on some islands. “As for the limited and necessary self-defense facilities China has built on islands and reefs stationed by Chinese personnel, that is consistent with the self defense and self-preservation China is entitled to under international law,” he said. Wang added that “nonmilitarization is certainly in the interest of all parties, but nonmilitarization should not be just about one single country.” During a state visit to the United States in September, Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged not to militarize the contested Spratly Islands, which lie to the south of the Paracels. On Wednesday, Kerry reiterated that the nonmilitarization standard in the South China Sea should be applied to all countries. Fox News, showing civilian satellite images from ImageSat International, said two batteries of eight surface-to-air missile launchers, as well as a radar system, were deployed on Woody Island at some point between Feb. 3 and Sunday. Urban, the Pentagon spokesman, said the images appeared to show an HQ-9 air defense system; HQ-9s have a range of about 125 miles. Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., head of the U.S. Pacific Command, said the deployment of missiles to the Paracels would not be a surprise but would be a concern and would contradict China’s pledge not to militarize the region, Reuters reported. “We will conduct more, and more complex, freedom-of-navigation operations as time goes on in the South China Sea,” Harris said at a briefing in Tokyo. “We have no intention of stopping.” Woody Island, called Yongxingdao by China, boasts an artificial harbor, an airport, roads, army posts and other buildings. Recent satellite imagery appears to show that China is conducting dredging and landfilling operations at two other islands in the Paracels, while adding a helicopter base on Duncan Island that could be used for anti-submarine warfare missions, the Diplomat magazine reported last week. The news broke just as Obama was completing two days of talks with 10 leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, at the Sunnylands retreat in California. Among those present were the leaders of Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines, which all have overlapping claims with China for various islands, reefs and atolls in parts of the South China Sea. “We discussed the need for tangible steps in the South China Sea to lower tensions, including a halt to further reclamation, new construction and militarization of disputed areas,” Obama said at a Tuesday news conference. At Sunnylands, Obama also pledged that the United States would continue to conduct “freedom of navigation” exercises in the South China Sea. He said maritime disputes must be resolved by legal means, including through a case brought by the Philippines challenging China’s claims over vast swaths of that sea. The White House also announced that Obama has accepted an invitation to visit Vietnam in May, reflecting a growing rapport between Washington and Hanoi that irks Beijing. China has accused the United States of undermining peace and stability in the region and infringing on its sovereignty by sailing naval vessels near some of the disputed islands in the South China Sea. Last month, a U.S. guided-missile destroyer passed close to Triton Island in the Paracels in what the U.S. military said was a response to “excessive maritime claims” that impinge on the rights and freedoms of the United States and other nations. China said the action “severely violated the law.” Beijing has also refused to take part in an arbitration case brought by the Philippines in The Hague, arguing that the two countries should settle their dispute bilaterally. But Obama said all parties to the U.N. law of the sea are obligated to respect the ruling. Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, said China has been building up its military facilities on the Paracels for some years. He said that it was unclear whether this latest reported move was a direct reaction to the recent U.S. naval operation in Paracels but that Beijing would probably try to justify it as a “reaction to U.S. military moves in the South China Sea.” It could, he said, be a precursor to China eventually declaring some kind of air defense identification zone in the northern South China Sea, which could ultimately be extended farther south as military facilities are built up on the Spratly Islands. Such a move would be seen very negatively by the United States and regional claimants. But for the time being, deploying missiles on Woody Island is less provocative than making a similar move on the Spratlys, he said, because the Paracels are basically a bilateral issue with Vietnam rather than a multilateral one. “It is not as provocative as it could have been,” he said. “If they had deployed missiles on the Spratlys, that would have elicited a much stronger response from other countries in Southeast Asia. We’ll see a strong reaction from Vietnam, but I don't anticipate the other claimants will react strongly, if at all.” Taiwan’s president-elect, Tsai Ing-wen, told reporters following news of the report that tensions were higher in the region, according to Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency. “We urge all parties to work on the situation based on principles of peaceful solution and self-control,” Tsai said. Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said the deployment of missiles on Woody Island “increases tensions in the South China Sea,” the Associated Press reported. In Vietnam, about 100 people, gathering to commemorate the start of a 1979 invasion by Chinese forces, chanted “Down with the aggressors” and “Hoang Sa, Truong Sa,” the Vietnamese terms for the Paracel and Spratly island chains.

BEIJING — A U.S. naval destroyer sailed early Tuesday within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built by China in the South China Sea, a U.S. defense official said, in a direct challenge to China’s territorial claims. The USS Lassen, a guided-missile destroyer, was accompanied by Navy surveillance planes as it approached the Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands, the official said. The mission “was completed without incident,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The decision to go ahead with the mission follows months of deliberation in Washington and is certain to China, which said last month it would “never allow any country” to violate what it considers to be its territorial waters and airspace around the islands. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had said earlier that Beijing was trying to verify whether the U.S. vessel had entered the 12-mile zone. “If true, we advise the U.S. to think again, not to act blindly or make trouble out of nothing,” the Foreign Ministry quoted him as saying. China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its territory, including the main islands and reefs, and has argued that giving up that claim would “shame its ancestors.” The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims, and several of them also occupy different islands, reefs and rocks. A massive Chinese program of land reclamation and construction on several islands has taken place since 2014, upsetting ties with the United States and several of those rival claimants. This week’s U.S. naval mission is also intended to test a pledge made by President Xi Jinping during his visit to Washington last month that Beijing would not militarize the islands, U.S. officials have said. Subi Reef, which lies close to the Philippines in the South China Sea, used to be submerged at high tide before China began a massive dredging project to turn it into an island. It is now big enough to potentially host an airstrip. Satellite images also show what looks like a surveillance tower and multiple satellite antennas on Subi reef, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, part of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Under the international law of the sea, turning such features into artificial islands does not imply any rights to territorial waters around them, something the U.S. mission is designed to underline, although countries can claim a “safety zone” of just 500 meters around previously submerged reefs. A Chinese airstrip is already under construction at Fiery Cross reef and experts say another could potentially soon be built at Mischief reef. China says the construction work is primarily designed for civilian use and will not affect freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. But the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that the concept of freedom of navigation should not be used as an excuse for muscle-flexing and that the United States should “refrain from saying or doing anything provocative and act responsibly in maintaining peace and regional stability,” Chinese state media reported. In Washington, experts backed the U.S. naval action. “This should have been done a long time ago,” said Bonnie Glaser, an expert on the Chinese military at CSIS. The Navy has wanted conduct such an operation for some time, but the Obama administration had prevented that until now, she said. While the exercise would probably not stop China from further construction or militarization of air strips on the reefs, Glaser said that there were still good reasons to go ahead. “Our aim in any freedom of navigation operation is not aimed at that kind of objective. It is simply to sail through waters that are subject to the law of the sea,” she said. “Some parts of the administration believed this would make things even more difficult, that China would become even more obstreperous, more difficult to deal with,” she said, “and others thought this wasn’t something we should do before Xi Jinping came to Washington.” At the summit, President Obama told Xi that the United States would operate, fly or sail anywhere that international law allows. On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest referred questions on specific operations to the Pentagon but reiterated that commitment to freedom of navigation. “This is a critically important principle, particularly in the South China Sea, because there are billions of dollars of commerce that flow through that region of the world every year, and maybe even more than that, Earnest said. “Ensuring the free flow of this commerce and that freedom of navigation of those vessels is protected is critically important to the global economy.” Additional patrols will follow in coming weeks, and could also be conducted around features that have been built up by Vietnam and the Philippines in the Spratlys, a U.S. defense official told the Reuters news agency. “This is something that will be a regular occurrence, not a one-off event,” the official said, also speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s not something that’s unique to China.” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Monday the United States is not required to consult with other nations if it decides to conduct such operations. “The whole point of freedom of navigation in international waters is that it’s international waters. You don’t need to consult with anybody. That’s the idea,” he said. At the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I., associate professor Andrew Erickson said the U.S action underscored its “commitment to maintaining an open global system with global commons that all are free to use to the maximum extent permitted by international law.” “As can be seen from the operation’s peaceful, unimpeded nature, China and the U.S. share an interest in keeping the vital sea lanes of the South China Sea stable and open,” he said. The USS Lassen, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, operates out of its home port in Yokosuka, Japan — headquarters for the U.S. 7th Fleet. The Lassen has been deployed to the South China Sea since late May and has had several routine interactions at sea with Chinese naval vessels, according to U.S. Navy officials. Whitlock and Mufson reported from Washington.	760	"[{""start"": 2658, ""end"": 2795, ""text"": ""hina says the construction work is primarily designed for civilian use and will not affect freedom of navigation in the South China Sea."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	737	2023-04-26T22:37:26.685128Z	2023-04-26T22:37:26.685260Z	306.434
The two sides of U.S.-China relations were on full display Tuesday, as the top U.S. military officer in the Pacific told Congress that “China is clearly militarizing the South China Sea,” while Secretary of State John F. Kerry, after meeting with his Chinese counterpart, said there is only one U.S. foreign policy in the region and that is to seek a negotiated resolution of the ­issue. Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. said that “you have to believe in a flat Earth” to think China’s goal is not to militarize the area and achieve “hegemony in East Asia.” Harris told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he had asked the Pentagon for more overhead surveillance in the disputed South China Sea area. Kerry, in a news conference with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, said that the State and Defense departments were “on the same page” but that the Pentagon’s job was to “address what happens if . . . [diplomacy] fails.” “They have to be prepared for any eventuality,” Kerry said. The exchanges followed a report this week, based on satellite imagery, that China has installed a series of radar facilities on artificial islands it has built from dredged material on atolls in areas that other countries in the region either claim or say are international waters. Last week, the administration said that China appeared to have deployed surface-to-air missiles on another artificial island in the disputed sea. A U.S. official on Tuesday night confirmed a report from Fox News that China has deployed fighter jets to the same island. Harris said that “surface-to-surface, surface-to-air missiles” on one island and “the new radars on the Cuarteron Reef . . . are actions that are changing in my opinion the operation of the landscape in the South China Sea.” The weaponry “could pose a threat” to U.S. aircraft carriers in the region, he said. Wang, speaking beside Kerry later in the day, said that “China sees the islands historically as China’s territory” and “has a right to uphold its territorial integrity and lawful and legitimate maritime rights and interests.” At the same time, he said, “we are committed to resolving the disputes through dialogue and negotiations in a peaceful way.” The United States has called for international arbitration of the regional dispute and sent warships and aircraft to patrol what it says are international waters. Wang said that the “South China Sea issue is not and should not become an issue between China and the United States” and that it should be resolved directly between the regional parties. “There have not been any problems with regard to freedom of navigation,” he said, and “no commercial vessel has encountered any problems.” China and the countries of the region, he said, “have the capability to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, which we see in our own interests. And we don’t hope to see any more close-up military reconnaissance or the dispatch of missile destroyers or strategic bombers” to the area. For much of their news conference, both Kerry and Wang hailed what they described as growing U.S.-China cooperation on issues including the Iran nuclear deal, climate change, counterterrorism and ending the civil war in Syria. “The reason that we’ve been able to cooperate in areas where our interests and our values are aligned, despite the fact that we have clear differences on some other issues, is that both the United States and China are deeply committed to an open and frank dialogue,” Kerry said. “We are two powerful nations, the two largest economies today, and we have an ability therefore to be able to make good things happen when we decide to.” Both said that the United Nations was close to agreeing on a new resolution against North Korea for its recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests that violated U.N. mandates. Both also called for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and a resumption of diplomatic talks with the North. In addition, Wang pointed out that China is now the largest U.S. trading partner, with bilateral trade last year of $558.4 billion. Although that still puts China slightly behind Canada for the whole of 2015, the Chinese overtook Canada for the last several months of the year.

New satellite images show the Chinese military shoring up its defenses on a disputed island chain in the South China Sea, adding what appears to be reinforced launch sites for surface-to-air missiles on at least three atolls. The existence of the new launch sites was first reported by Reuters on Wednesday, and on Thursday, photos of the nearly completed structures were obtained by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The images show at least eight structures on three of China’s man-made atolls in the Spratly Islands: Fiery Cross, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef. A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said Wednesday that the buildings have retractable roofs, making them suitable launching points for medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile systems. According to a photo analysis by CSIS, the buildings are about 66 feet long and 33 feet wide, making them large enough to store China’s HQ-9 missile system. The HQ-9 closely resembles Russia’s S-300, a surface-to-air missile system with a range of approximately 93 miles and an ability to hit targets flying at 88,000 feet. It is unclear, however, whether the actual HQ-9 launchers have been deployed to the Spratlys, as one of the benefits of the new launch structures is the ability to conceal them from reconnaissance flights and satellites. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang didn’t deny the existence of the launch sites at a Wednesday briefing with reporters. “China has indisputable sovereignty of the South China Sea islands and their adjacent water,” he said. “China will uphold its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. At the same time, we are committed to peacefully resolve relevant disputes through negotiation and consultation with countries directly concerned and are committed to working together with ASEAN countries to maintain peace and stability on the South China Sea. China has the right to deploy necessary defense facilities as appropriate on its own territory.” The HQ-9s on the Spratlys would be a significant improvement to the island chain’s defenses. In December, satellite imagery showed that the Chinese military had built a structure that contained antiaircraft guns and potentially close-in weapons systems, or CIWS. Often found on U.S. ships and installations, CIWS is a network of weapons that tracks and destroys incoming missiles. Both the CIWS and antiaircraft guns, however, are limited in range compared to the HQ-9s’ ability to track and hit targets beyond the horizon. Last year, China deployed HQ-9s to the Paracel Islands, a cluster of similar man-made atolls north of the Spratlys and near the coast of Vietnam. In February 2016, an HQ-9 battery was observed on the Paracels’ Woody Island, but by July the missiles had been withdrawn. Woody Island also reportedly is home to Chinese YJ-62 anti-ship cruise missiles. China has long claimed that the South China Sea’s resource-rich waters and its tiny atolls are sovereign Chinese territory, but many of the islands also have been claimed by multiple other countries, including Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. The U.S. military, in support of its regional allies, has contested Chinese claims in the form of what the Pentagon calls “Freedom of Navigation Operations.” Over the weekend, the USS Carl Vinson, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, began operations in the South China Sea without incident. It is unclear how President Trump will react to China’s continued militarization in the South China Sea.

BEIJING — A U.S. warship sailed within 12 miles of one China’s largest artificial islands Tuesday, part of a continuing effort by the Pentagon to demonstrate that the United States remains undeterred by the rapid Chinese military buildup in the South China Sea. The presence of the USS William P. Lawrence, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, prompted the Chinese military to scramble three fighter jets that monitored the destroyer, along with three Chinese ships, until the American vessel left the area. “This operation demonstrates, as President Obama has stated, that the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows,” said Cmdr. Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman. “That is [as] true in the South China Sea as in other places around the globe.” The Lawrence passed near Fiery Cross Reef in what the Pentagon calls a freedom of navigation operation and exercised its “right of innocent passage,” according to Urban. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on the operation. The vessel was not conducting military maneuvers and was allowed to sail near the reef under international maritime law, U.S. officials said. Two years ago, Fiery Cross Reef was little more than a cluster of rocks jutting out of the water, but in recent months the Chinese have built it into a military facility, complete with a runway, helicopter landing areas and a port. The installation is one of more than a half-dozen Chinese-developed islands in the disputed Spratly Islands. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the U.S. destroyer entered the area without China’s permission. “The American naval vessel threatened China’s sovereignty, security and interests, and it harmed the safety of the people and facilities in the island, damaging regional stability,” Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said in a regularly scheduled news conference. “As we have stressed over and over again, China firmly opposes such behavior and we will take necessary measures to safeguard China’s sovereignty and territory.” The Chinese Defense Ministry said later Tuesday that the equipment stationed on Fiery Cross is defensive in nature and accused the United States of militarizing the South China Sea with its repeated patrols in the area. [Pentagon chief postpones visit to China as tensions simmer in South China Sea] The U.S. operation came a day after the people of the Philippines went to the polls to elect a new president and just ahead of Obama’s visit to Vietnam later this month. Both the Philippines and Vietnam have laid claim to Fiery Cross, as has Taiwan. Tuesday’s voyage marks the third freedom of navigation operation since last fall. In January, the USS Curtis Wilbur passed near the Paracel Islands, and in October the USS Lassen did the same near Subi Reef. Both the Wilbur and Lassen are destroyers. Adm. Scott Swift, the top officer overseeing the Navy’s Pacific Fleet, said in a recent interview that the United States needs to be thoughtful, consistent, firm and patient about how it demonstrates freedom of navigation in the region. In the past year, it has challenged maritime claims in the region not only by China, but also by Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines, according to a Pentagon report released last month. “It’s not that we need to drive right at these claims and challenge them in the starkest possible way,” Swift said. “The subtleties have as much impact as something that is more apparent, brash, kind of in-your-face. And I think that at this time of increased tensions, we need to be thoughtful about that.” In recent weeks, the United States has sent warplanes to nearby Scarborough Shoal, a chain of coral reefs near the Philippines that China seized in 2012. The increased activity in both the Spratly Islands and near Scarborough Shoal comes as a panel of jurists at a United Nations-appointed tribunal in The Hague deliberates on whether China can legally claim the area around the disputed islands in the South China Sea as territorial waters.

BEIJING — China’s expansive assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea suffered a major blow Tuesday when an international tribunal ruled that its claims have no legal or historical basis, throwing up the possibility of a new period of tension and confrontation in the region. Beijing fiercely rejected the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which sided unequivocally with the Philippines against China. The United States urged calm. China’s government has whipped up nationalist sentiment in recent years to support its “indisputable sovereignty” over a huge swath of the South China Sea, and it has engaged in an intensive program of island-building there to extend its de facto control. China is now faced with a dilemma: It can signal its displeasure at the ruling by extending that program and militarizing the islands it controls, risking confrontation and even conflict with emboldened Asian neighbors and the United States. Or it can suspend the program and adopt a more conciliatory approach, at the risk of a loss of face domestically. “It’s a slap in the face for China,” said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University. “It’s a lose-lose situation for China — take action and risk armed confrontation or, while reiterating its tough stance, stop building and fishing, which is what the ruling asks.” The tribunal also ruled that China had violated the Philippines’ sovereign rights by constructing artificial islands and had caused “permanent irreparable harm to the coral reef ecosystem.” The decision was hailed as a landmark victory for those worried that Beijing is extending its military control over waters with key strategic and commercial significance. But Chinese President Xi Jinping signaled that he was in no mood to back down. “The islands in the South China Sea have been Chinese territories since ancient times,” he said, according to state media. “China opposes and will never accept any claim or action based on these awards.” The Foreign Ministry said China “solemnly declares that the award is null and void and has no binding force.” Nor would it be easy for Xi to back down after making the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” one of his signature slogans, drawing a rhetorical line from its past “humiliation” at the hands of Western colonial powers and Japan to his vision of a strong, proud China under Communist Party rule. But the verdict will nevertheless undermine Beijing’s claim to sovereignty within what it calls the “nine-dash line,” which it draws around most of the South China Sea. The Philippines took China to the PCA in January 2013 after the Chinese navy seized control of Scarborough Shoal, a largely submerged chain of reefs and rocks amid rich fishing grounds off the Philippine island of Luzon. The ruling could lead to more friction between China and the United States, with the issue seen as a key test of Washington’s ability to maintain its leading role in Asian security in the face of China’s rising power. The State Department said it “hopes and expects” that China and the Philippines will abide by the ruling. “We urge all claimants to avoid provocative statements or actions,” said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. called the ruling a “milestone,” but he also urged “restraint and sobriety” for all concerned. Richard Javad Heydarian, an assistant professor of political science at Manila’s De La Salle University, said the verdict is “the best-case scenario that few thought possible.” “It is a clean sweep for the Philippines,” Heydarian said, “with the tribunal rejecting China’s nine-dashed line and historical rights claim as well as censuring its aggressive activities in the area and, among others, the ecological damage caused by its reclamation activity.” In China, Chen Xiangmiao, an assistant research fellow at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said: “The nine-dash line is the foundation of China’s claim to sovereignty activities in the South China Sea, which has been smashed by the ruling. It is highly possible that the Philippines will expand its presence in the South China Sea, which will create conflict.” Beijing refused to participate in the arbitration process and launched a global propaganda campaign. Foreign Minister Wang Yi was quoted as telling Secretary of State John F. Kerry last week that the case was a “farce.” His ministry said it was delusional to think China would bow to diplomatic pressure to accept the ruling. Some $5 trillion in commerce, roughly one-third of global trade, flows through the South China Sea every year, while its fisheries account for 12percent of the global catch, and significant oil and gas reserves are thought to exist under the seafloor. The waters are some of the most fiercely disputed in the world, with claims to various parts staked by Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan, in addition to China and the Philippines. China claims sovereignty over almost all the islands, reefs and rocks in the sea — including those hundreds of miles from Chinese shores. In the past two years, Beijing has turned seven reefs and rocks into nascent military outposts, with airstrips and radar installations under construction. But the tribunal backed the Philippines’ submission that none of those features are islands — as defined by the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Only natural — rather than artificial — islands that can sustain human habitation qualify for both the 12 nautical miles of territorial waters and 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones under UNCLOS. In other words, the ruling drastically undermines China’s claim to the waters surrounding the island bases it is building. Beijing says the tribunal lacked the jurisdiction to rule on Manila’s various submissions. Though its decision is legally binding, the court lacks any mechanism to enforce its rulings. Nevertheless, the outcome of the case will provide an important indication of China’s willingness to submit to international law, and of what kind of global power it wants to become. “This is a breathtaking indictment of China’s position in the South China Sea,” said David Welch, a global-security scholar at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Waterloo, Ontario. “It will be very difficult for Beijing to pretend that the tribunal’s finding does not matter legally, politically or practically. How China reacts over the next days and weeks will essentially determine its international standing for decades.” What happens next will depend on how all the key players react. The U.S. Navy has already conducted several “freedom of navigation” exercises in the South China Sea, sending warships within 12 nautical miles of islands, reefs and rocks controlled by China and other claimants. Washington is also rebuilding military ties with the Philippines. China cites this as evidence that President Obama’s actions — not its own island-building — are responsible for militarizing the region. China could attempt to reinforce its position by building a new military base on Scarborough Shoal, a move that would clearly be viewed as dangerously provocative by Washington and Manila. Paul Reichler, the Philippines’ chief counsel in the case, said the ruling was likely to unite all the rival claimants to the waters of the South China Sea against China. “China may face a prolonged period of embittered neighbors and an uncertain, unstable and insecure situation in the South China Sea unless and until it finds a way to accommodate itself to the rule of law as clearly set forth in the arbitral award,” he said. China, which hosts a summit of the Group of 20 major economies in September, may want time to gauge the reaction from Manila, where the newly elected president, Rodrigo Duterte, has sent mixed signals. Early in his election campaign, Duterte implied he might be willing to soften his stance on China in return for Chinese infrastructure projects on his home island of Mindanao. But he later promised to ride a water scooter to Scarborough Shoal to plant the Philippine flag.

China has apparently deployed an advanced surface-to-air missile system onto a disputed island in the South China Sea, according to U.S. and Taiwanese officials. The deployment was first reported by Fox News after Fox obtained satellite imagery detailing the equipment on the eastern part of Woody Island in the Paracel Island chain. In late January, a U.S. guided missile destroyer passed within 12 miles of Triton Island in the same chain, in what is known as a freedom of navigation patrol. The exercise drew condemnation from China at the time. According to the imagery, the missiles were emplaced sometime between Feb. 3 and Feb. 14. According to a U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence issues, he believes the images are accurate and that the systems are HQ-9s. Both Taiwan and Vietnam have claimed Woody Island as their own. The missiles, known as the HQ-9, are a variant much like the United States Patriot missile battery and the Russians S-300. Both systems can engage targets at what is known as a “beyond the horizon” range using a set of sensors and radars that allow missiles to track and hit targets more than 100 miles away from the launch site. The HQ-9 is mounted to a truck chassis, which allows it be highly mobile when not in use. “From their perspective this is a defense system designed to protect their sovereign territory,” said Neil Ashdown, a deputy editor at IHS Janes, a military research group. Not only can the HQ-9 hit aircraft, but like the S-300 and Patriot, it can also hit ballistic missiles. The system can also engage targets at more than 80,000 feet high. The deployment of advanced surface-to-air systems has been the go-to move for countries to project their military might in recent months, and it seems China has ripped a page right out of Russia’s playbook. In December, following the shoot-down of a Russian strike fighter by Turkish F-16s, Russia deployed S-400 missile systems onto their airbase in northern Syria. [China finishes first airstrip in hotly-contested island chain] According to Ashdown, the decision to deploy the HQ-9 is more a symbolic move than a military escalation. The Chinese could have deployed other systems that were less high-profile than the HQ-9, which is just short of the deployment of land-based anti-ship cruise missiles, something Ashdown believes would be an extremely aggressive move on China’s behalf. Regardless of the Chinese government’s intent, the HQ-9 could be the first part of a deployment of systems that could create a sophisticated anti-access/anti-denial (A2/AD) network in the region. In short, the HQ-9 could interface with other systems to create a sort of defensive bubble over the disputed island chains, making any type overflight for U.S. aircraft extremely dangerous and problematic in the event of an actual conflict. “[The deployment of the HQ-9] reflects a harder step by Beijing towards these Maritime claims,” said Ashdown. “This is a harder step than what we’ve seen in 2015.” Read more: Obama welcomes 10 Southeast Asian leaders to California summit By 2030, South China Sea will be ‘virtually a Chinese lake,’ study warns U.S. missile destroyer sailed close to island claimed by China	754	"[{""start"": 334, ""end"": 547, ""text"": ""In late January, a U.S. guided missile destroyer passed within 12 miles of Triton Island in the same chain, in what is known as a freedom of navigation patrol.

Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter will embark on a trip in coming days that will focus heavily on China’s influence across Southeast Asia, including the disputed South China Sea. But the secretary’s travel itinerary won’t include a key player in that discussion: China itself. The trip will include visits to India and the Philippines before Carter pivots to the Middle East with stops in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement Friday. The Pentagon has sought to strengthen relationships with India and the Philippines as China expands its military and puts a variety of new equipment and weapons in the South China Sea, including surface-to-air missiles and advanced radar. Carter accepted in November an invitation to visit China after he met with the country’s defense minister, Gen. Chang Wanquan, during a meeting in Malaysia. U.S. defense officials said at the time that the two senior defense officials agreed to work out details for a visit this spring, but when the Pentagon released details about the trip Friday, China was not included. Cook said Friday that Carter still expects to visit China later this year. The secretary’s “complicated schedule did not allow for it to take place during this trip,” he said. The Wall Street Journal first reported the decision Friday, and U.S. officials said they informed Beijing in the past few weeks that Carter would not be visiting. Carter discussed his trip Friday during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, saying — as he often does — that the Asia-Pacific region is the most consequential region to America’s future. While the United States and China have disagreements over some issues, they are continuing to work through those, he said. “This is a region that has had it good for 70 years, and this would be a serious mistake for all of us to allow that to unravel,” he said in response to a question. “And for militarization to lead to tension, to lead to conflict. So, we’re trying to prevent that.” Related on Checkpoint: These are the military bases the U.S. will use in the Philippines. China isn’t impressed.

Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is in Asia this week, making stops in India and the Philippines to bolster relationships that the United States could call on in a time of crisis. Discussion has focused at least in part on the South China Sea, where tensions remain high as China has deployed surface-to-air missiles and other equipment and several countries have made conflicting territorial claims. Security concerns about the South China Sea often focus on the ships that traverse it, including in so-called freedom of navigation operations run by the U.S. Navy and recent efforts by Chinese fishermen and coast guard units to take control of the lucrative fishing business in the region. But another element of maritime security has received less attention: submarines. The Navy’s “Silent Service” rarely discloses its operations, but is part of a diverse and growing international fleet of submersibles that is deployed across the Pacific region broadly and in the South China Sea specifically. Adm. Scott Swift, the top officer of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in an interview that submarines are a “critically valuable asset” to him. Surface-to-air missiles and other weapons in the region are deployed as part of a concept known as anti-access area denial (A2AD) to hinder the movement of adversaries, but submarines aren’t affected by them like surface ships and aircraft because they’re below the surface, he said. “It gives me much more open access to areas that would be more contested in a conflict for surface units, for instance, or air units, potentially,” Swift said. The United States, China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia are all among the countries looking for ways to upgrade submarine operations in coming years. Swift said it’s in part a “reflection of the angst” in the theater with respect to not just China, but others as well. “It’s certainly centralized in the minds of many in the South China Sea, but we see it more broadly and certainly in the East China Sea and elsewhere,” Swift said. The Pentagon expects to spend about $97 billion alone in coming years on what it calls the Ohio-class replacement program, phasing out 14 existing nuclear missile submarines with a new generation of vessels that includes 12 more. Additionally, it has been buying a new generation of attack submarine called the Virginia class since 1998, phasing out old attack subs in its Los Angeles and Seawolf classes while also investigating how it can expand operations with unmanned submarines. “We’re investing over $8 billion just next year to ensure ours is the most lethal and most advanced undersea and anti-submarine force in the world,” Carter said last week while previewing his trip to Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “That includes new undersea drones in multiple sizes and diverse payloads that can, importantly, operate in shallow water, where manned submarines can’t.” Some national security analysts have speculated that part of China’s desire to take over all or part of the South China Sea is to create a sanctuary for its submarines. It includes some areas that are more than 1.5 miles beneath the surface, and underwater canyons where a submersible could hide. In December, China deployed a new nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, the JIN-class, adding a vessel capable of carrying sea-based nuclear missiles for the first time. China also deployed attack submarines to the Indian Ocean for the first time in 2014, ostensibly to support counter-piracy operations but more realistically to gain familiarity with the region and to demonstrate an emerging capability, according to the Pentagon’s annual report on China military operations released last year. Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, predicted in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is likely to continue adding more military equipment in the South China Sea, something that could again increase China’s A2AD abilities in the region. Stewart said China’s vocal opposition to freedom of navigation operations by the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea demonstrates “that Beijing recognizes the need to defend these outposts and is prepared to respond to any military operations near them.” Freedom of navigation operations occur when the Navy sends a ship, usually a destroyer, through a region in which a country such as China has made maritime claims that the United States considers excessive. The Navy ran them through the South China Sea with the USS Lassen in October and the USS Curtis Wilbur in January, prompting allegations from Beijing that the United States violated Chinese law by entering what it considers its territorial seas. The United States considers the operations legal through the right of innocent passage, in which a ship travels through a territorial sea while meeting a series of restrictions outlined by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. The restrictions include using weapons of any kind, launching or landing aircraft, or interfering in any way with the communications of a coastal state nearby.	752	"[{""start"": 3407, ""end"": 3732, ""text"": ""China also deployed attack submarines to the Indian Ocean for the first time in 2014, ostensibly to support counter-piracy operations but more realistically to gain familiarity with the region and to demonstrate an emerging capability, according to the Pentagon’s annual report on China military operations released last year"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	729	2023-04-26T15:43:15.363374Z	2023-04-26T15:43:15.363492Z	293.893
"Satellite images show China may be building a powerful new radar system on a disputed island in the South China Sea, which could have worrisome military uses in monitoring -- and potentially trying to control -- a strategically vital waterway, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Gregory Poling, head of the Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative at CSIS, said the images appear to show a high-frequency radar installation being built on Cuarteron Reef, one of seven islands China has recently expanded through a massive land reclamation program in the Spratly chain. ""If it is an HF radar, then it would enormously boost China’s capacity to monitor ships and aircraft in the South China Sea,"" Poling wrote by email. ""Cuarteron is the logical place for such an installation because it is the southernmost of China’s features in the Spratlys, meaning that it would be the best place if you wanted early warning radar to give notice of ships or planes coming up from the Strait of Malacca and other areas to the south such as Singapore. ""This would be very important in a Chinese anti-access area denial strategy that sought to reduce the ability of the U.S. to operate freely in the South China Sea, including bringing forces up through the South China Sea in case of any future crisis in Northeast Asia,"" Poling wrote. The Strait of Malacca passes between Malaysia and Indonesia and is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world, while a third of the world's shipping, and much of Asia's oil, passes through the South China Sea. China has built up seven islands in the South China Sea, and is in the process of constructing three runways on those islands. The United States says it is concerned about the growing militarization of the South China Sea, Secretary of State John F. Kerry expressed ""serious concern"" last week when other satellite images showed what appeared to be surface-to-air missile batteries deployed by China on Woody Island, part of the Paracel chain, also in the South China Sea. China says its construction program in the South China Sea is mainly for civilian use, adding that it is only building limited and necessary defensive facilities on what it considers to be its sovereign territory. It points out that other nations have also reclaimed land and built runways in the past, although not on anything like this scale. ""It is certainly possible to claim a civilian purpose, and China will,"" Poling wrote. ""But just like you don’t need a 3,000-meter runway to land civilian planes, you don’t need a high-frequency radar (assuming that is what this is) to give early warning of commercial traffic. Radar is inherently dual-use, but just like its other “dual-use” infrastructure in the Spratlys, the real value is military. More limited radar, like China has at every other feature in the Spratlys, is more than sufficient to monitor and ensure the safety of civilian traffic near the features."" China points to lighthouses it has constructed on two islands, as well as meteorological stations and shelter and rescue facilities, to highlight the civilian nature of its construction program. One of the new lighthouses sits on Cuarteron Reef. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused the United States of ""sensationalizing the South China Sea issue"" and ""hyping up tensions."" ""Islands in the South China Sea have been part of China since ancient times,"" she said at a daily news conference.

"A Chinese official has a novel plan for Woody Island, a tiny, tropical and very much contested speck in the South China Sea. Han Fangming, a businessman and political adviser, said this week that the government ought to turn the less-than-one-square-mile outpost into China’s version of the British Virgin Islands. His pitch is to use the place as a hub for company registration. Chinese companies like Alibaba and Baidu are doing business in the Cayman Islands, he said in a news release, so why not bring that money home? Well, why not indeed. But what seems like a modest proposal ahead of China’s annual legislative meetings is actually much bolder — and more interesting — than it seems. Though Han’s vision of Bermuda-on-the-Pacific may never come to pass, the thinking behind it is important. In a statement published by his think tank, Han laid out the benefits of having an offshore haven in the middle of a rapidly militarizing stretch of sea. “Promoting offshore services there will be a boon to both local economic development and the safeguarding of national interests,” he said. What Han is getting at is the link between sovereignty claims and civilian installations. We hear a lot about the militarization of the South China Sea: The United States says China is militarizing; China says the United States is to blame. However you slice it, there’s a whole lot of military hardware on the scene. What gets less attention in the foreign press — but lots of play at home — is China’s effort to build up civilian infrastructure, its moves to make minuscule islands, atolls and reefs into habitable settlements with the stuff of life: badminton and beer, tourists and, if Han has his way, all your offshore banking needs. China is not the only South China Sea claimant to focus on civilian infrastructure — the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia have all staked their claims, so to speak. But as Joanna Chiu pointed out in a piece for Foreign Policy this week, China’s building is happening at warp speed, especially on Woody Island. The island, which is called Yongxing in Chinese, is the largest of the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan. It is the seat of government for a prefecture-level city, Sansha, which China established in 2012. (""China's southernmost and youngest city,"" noted Han.) Woody Island is soon to have all the trappings of a modern Chinese metropolis, minus the millions. The island is home to about 1,000 people; three in four of those people are military personnel, according to a recent report by PLA Daily, a military newspaper. The island’s not-so-civilian population can now make use of a school,  a hospital and a post office, watch satellite TV and keep in touch via a 4G signal, the paper said — not bad for a small town. Sprucing things up makes strategic sense for the Chinese, says Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. The goal is to demonstrate “effective occupation and continuous administration,” which has proved critical in previous territorial disputes. Though the case is unlikely to end up at the International Court of Justice  — China would never agree to it — making the island look and act like an ordinary Chinese city (plus palm trees) would bolster Beijing’s claim that these islands serve civilian purposes — an idea it's keen to sell, both at home and abroad. Addressing journalists in Beijing this week, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said Chinese people “love” the islands of the South China Sea. “China was the first country to discover, name, develop and administer the South China Sea islands,” he said. “Our ancestors lived and worked there for generations, so we know and love the place more than anyone else.” It's hard to believe the average citizen’s heart beats a little quicker at the mention of Woody Island or its ilk, but turning Sansha into a money-soaked mini-Bermuda won’t hurt the cause. It may be tougher, though, to convince China’s neighbors, or the United States, that newly furnished islands and atolls are about anything other than sovereignty claims. “The main purpose is strategic — the idea that these are for civilian use is a pretext; nobody believes it,” Storey said. “It’s just a game."""	749	"[{""start"": 3945, ""end"": 4235, ""text"": ""It may be tougher, though, to convince China’s neighbors, or the United States, that newly furnished islands and atolls are about anything other than sovereignty claims. “The main purpose is strategic — the idea that these are for civilian use is a pretext; nobody believes it,” Storey said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	727	2023-04-26T15:28:39.630063Z	2023-04-26T15:28:39.630234Z	222.614
BEIJING — China said Tuesday that it plans to extend its global military reach to safeguard its economic interests, while defending its territorial claims at sea against “provocative actions” by neighbors and “meddling” by the United States. A policy document setting out China’s military strategy, issued by the State Council, or cabinet, underlined the dramatic growth of the country’s defense ambitions — especially its naval ambitions — in tandem with its rapid economic rise. Beijing insisted in the document that its military is dedicated to “international security cooperation” and peaceful development. But it also said the navy will expand its focus from “offshore waters defense” to a greater emphasis on “open seas protection” as China aims to establish itself as a maritime power. The air force, meanwhile, will shift its focus from “territorial air defense to both defense and offense.” Patrick Cronin, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, called the white ­paper ­“a blueprint for achieving ­slow-motion regional hegemony.” “It asserts a confidence backed by growing capability on land and increasingly at sea,” he said. “While it calls for balancing China’s territorial ‘rights’ with ‘stability,’ there should be little doubt on the part of its neighbors that China is building a maritime force to assert the former.” China’s officially disclosed defense budget was expanded by just over 10 percent this year, to $141 billion, marking two decades of nearly unbroken double-digit growth. The navy is reportedly building a second aircraft carrier and has invested heavily in submarines and warships. “China has made it a strategic goal to become a maritime power,” Senior Col. Wang Jin said at a news conference Tuesday. “Therefore, we need to build a strong navy.” He added that the development of long-range precision weapons means that the battlefield at sea is widening. “Offshore-waters defense alone can no longer provide effective defense of the country’s maritime interests,” he said. In Washington, State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said the administration was aware of the paper and continued to monitor China’s military developments carefully. “We also continue to urge China to exhibit greater transparency with respect to its capabilities and to its intentions,” he said. According to a Pentagon report released this month, China is developing missiles designed to “push adversary forces — including the United States — farther from potential regional conflicts.” The Chinese military is mainly focused on readying for possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait but also is investing to prepare for “contingencies” in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, where it is engaged in several territorial disputes, the Pentagon report said. Chinese officials say that the country’s declared annual defense spending is significantly below the global average when compared with the size of its economy. Its actual defense spending is almost certainly higher than the declared number but is still far lower than the Pentagon’s fiscal 2015 budget of $560 billion, experts say. In a move welcomed by other nations, China sent a 700-strong peacekeeping force in December to South Sudan, where it has extensive oil interests, marking the first time it has sent an infantry battalion on a U.N. mission. Beijing also is negotiating with the strategic port nation of Djibouti to open a military base there to support anti-piracy naval escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported this month. The United States and France already have a military presence in the tiny Horn of Africa country. “With the growth of China’s national interests, the security of our overseas energy and resources, strategic sea lines of communication and the safety of our overseas institutions, personnel and assets have become prominent issues,” Senior Col. Zhang Yuguo said at Tuesday’s news conference. Zhang added, however, a note of outreach apparently aimed at the United States and other countries watching China’s military growth. “China will never seek hegemony or divide up spheres of power, nor will it engage in military alliances or expansion,” he said. In addition to rattling its neighbors, China’s military growth has set the nation on a possible collision course with the United States. This year in particular, the Obama administration has repeatedly condemned a program of rapid land reclamation and construction on disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea. A U.S. surveillance plane was warned to leave the area by the Chinese navy last week, with Beijing lodging a formal diplomatic complaint . Senior Col. Yang Yujun, a Defense Ministry spokesman, on Tuesday likened China’s construction activities on the islands to “everyday actions” such as the building of houses, roads and bridges. But he acknowledged that the facilities being constructed, including an airstrip and radar stations, will have both military and civilian uses. Rathke, the State Department spokesman, said the United States took a different view, saying that China’s land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea have “contributed . . . to rising tensions” and suggesting that other countries in the region share that view. Yang said that the Chinese military was responding to increasingly frequent surveillance flights in a “legal and professional manner” but that the issue was being hyped up to “throw mud” at China. “There’s no ruling out the possibility that some country is seeking an excuse for its potential action in the future,” he said. “I don’t think this is a new trick. It’s an old trick.” On Monday, the state-owned tabloid the Global Times warned that war is “inevitable” if the United States tries to prevent China from finishing its reclamation and construction work. It said the risks would be “still under control” if Washington accepts China’s peaceful rise. Although not necessarily fully reflecting official thinking, the editorial shows China’s determination to continue its projects in the South China Sea. Yang said Sino-U.S. relations are generally good and noted that both militaries have signed agreements to govern air and maritime encounters and prevent crises. But the policy paper expressed concern about the United States’ “ ‘rebalancing’ strategy,” which has led China to enhance its military presence and strengthen military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region and worry about more assertive military and security policies in Japan. The document accused China’s neighbors of provocative actions by reinforcing their military presence on “China’s reefs and islands that they have illegally occupied.” “Some external countries are also busy meddling in South China Sea affairs,” it said, adding in a clear reference to the United States: “A tiny few maintain constant close-in air and sea surveillance and reconnaissance against China.” Philippines President Benigno Aquino III was quoted as saying Monday that his nation will continue flying over disputed islands in the South China Sea, while Defense Minister Voltaire Gazmin said he was seeking a “stronger commitment” from the United States to help its ally, according to news agency reports. China responded angrily. “I would like to remind the Philippines that China will not bully small countries, but small countries must not ceaselessly and willfully make trouble,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news conference. “We hope the Philippines can cease its instigation and provocation and return to the correct path of resolving the problem through negotiation and consultation.” On Tuesday, state media reported that China had held a groundbreaking ceremony for the building of two lighthouses on the disputed Spratly Islands, a move that Hua said was meant to fulfill the nation’s international obligations but that is unlikely to ease concerns about Beijing’s expanding influence. The military strategy paper also outlined threats emanating from instability on the Korean Peninsula, from separatist forces in its western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang and from forces attempting to instigate a “color revolution” to overthrow the Communist Party. It also noted growing threats in outer space and cyberspace.

BEIJING — The Chinese navy repeatedly warned a U.S. surveillance plane to leave airspace around disputed islands in the South China Sea, a sign that Beijing may seek to create a military exclusion zone in a move that could heighten regional tensions. The warnings, delivered eight times to a P-8A Poseidon over the Spratly Islands on Wednesday, were reported by a CNN team aboard the plane. “Foreign military aircraft. This is Chinese navy. You are approaching our military alert zone. Leave immediately,” a radio operator told the aircraft, later bluntly warning: “Go, go.” After each warning, the U.S. pilots responded calmly that the P-8A was flying through international airspace, according to the CNN team. China claims sovereignty over more than 80 percent of the South China Sea. Rival claimants to islands and reefs — set amid fertile fishing grounds and potentially oil- and gas-rich waters — include the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. In the Spratly Islands, China has been engaged in a massive program of land reclamation and construction, including building artificial islands. On Thursday, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, said Beijing “has the right to monitor certain airspace and maritime areas and safeguard national security, to prevent unexpected incidents at sea.” He added that other countries should respect China’s sovereignty. The Philippines says similar warnings have been delivered to its military aircraft in the past three months, suggesting that China is trying to exclude foreign military planes from the area. An attempt to impose restrictions in what is widely seen as international airspace would significantly raise tensions in the area and could provoke confrontations between the U.S. and Chinese militaries, experts said. Images captured by the U.S. plane’s high-performance cameras showed dozens of dredging vessels at different islands, some pumping sand onto reefs to build new land out of the ocean. They also showed an early-warning-radar building and a new airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef that CNN reported was long enough to land any military aircraft operated by China. Capt. Mike Parker, on board the aircraft, said he thinks that at least one of the verbal challenges came from the radar station. “Although China glosses over the military purpose of those artificial islands, they are likely primarily intended to change the power balance in the South China Sea vis-a-vis the U.S. Navy, which for now is the dominant force in the area,” said Yanmei Xie, senior China analyst at the International Crisis Group. China could use the completed installations to “scramble fighter jets to intercept, tail and attempt to evict incoming military aircraft,” Xie noted. “That scenario would turn the South China Sea into a theater of frequent near-misses and even clashes,” she said. Under international law, the construction of artificial islands confers no right of sovereignty over neighboring waters, and the United States has made it clear that it will not respect China’s claim to what it sees as international waters and airspace. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Col. Steve Warren, said “freedom of navigations operations” would continue in the South China Sea, but he insisted that U.S. military aircraft do not fly directly over areas claimed by China in the Spratly Islands. “We will continue to fly in international airspace,” he said. Secretary of State John F. Kerry expressed concern about China’s land reclamation project to the nation’s leaders last weekend, but his complaints appeared to fall on deaf ears. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s determination “to safeguard our own sovereignty and territorial is as firm as rock and is unshakable.” But on social media, some Chinese mocked the failure to scare off the U.S. plane. “Isn’t intercepting the robbers in the air the responsibility of the Chinese air force?” one asked. Another branded the incident a “national disgrace and a disgrace for the Chinese people.” Although China has acknowledged that the islands will have military uses, Hong insisted that the main purpose of the construction work was “to provide service for search and rescue at sea, fishing security, disaster prevention and relief, and meteorological monitoring, among other things.” Last week, senators on both sides of the aisle in Washington called for a more robust U.S. response to China’s maritime activity, arguing that China was not paying any price for its actions while regional allies were questioning U.S. commitment to Asian security. Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing, said Chinese President Xi Jinping has taken a much more assertive approach to strengthening his country’s maritime claims. “After several decades of being weak, the Chinese feel they have lost ground on their historical claims and are now in a better position to strengthen them. And the lack of strong U.S. leadership internationally has contributed to a sense in China that they can push these claims now and will not face negative consequences,” he said. Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a conference in Jakarta on Wednesday that China’s actions were eroding regional trust and could provoke conflict. “Its behavior threatens to set a new precedent whereby larger countries are free to intimidate smaller ones, and that provokes tensions, instability and can even lead to conflict,” he said, according to the Reuters news agency. But in a sign that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have taken measures to improve communication and avoid clashes, a U.S. combat ship used agreed codes for unplanned encounters when it met a Chinese vessel during a recent patrol of the South China Sea. “We exchanged messages, and it was very professional,” Cmdr. Matthew Kawas, the commanding officer of the USS Fort Worth, told visiting journalists in Singapore on Wednesday. He declined to comment further on the communications with the Chinese vessel, other than to point out that it is useful for both navies to become accustomed to each other’s practices. Earlier, Adm. Michelle Howard told reporters in Singapore that the two navies had agreed to use codes specifically designed to manage unplanned encounters at sea. “Fort Worth came across one of our counterparts and they did do that, so things went as professionally as they have since that agreement was made,” she said, according to Bloomberg News. If the Navy acts on the proposal to step up patrols in the South China Sea, the Fort Worth, a littoral combat vessel, and its sister ships are likely to play a key role. The expensive new additions to the Navy’s fleet are speedy and maneuverable and have a draft of just 15 feet. “It enables us to go places where other ships cannot,” said Capt. Fred Kacher, commodore of the U.S. Navy’s Destroyer Squadron 7, adding that an unmanned helicopter on board the ship is equipped with a a video camera that allows the Fort Worth “to see what’s going on.” Will Englund in Singapore, Liu Liu and Gu Jinglu in Beijing and Missy Ryan in Washington contributed to this report.

China appears to be taking new steps to lay down airfields on two reefs in a disputed area of the South China Sea on the eve of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Sept. 24 arrival in Washington for a state visit. Commercial satellite photos taken Tuesday for the Center for Strategic and International Studies show that China is flattening, rolling and putting gravel on an area the size of a military runway on Subi Reef, a once-submerged shoal that Beijing has built up into an area suitable for a military base. The flattened area is about 200 feet wide and nearly 1.4 miles long but is expected to grow and be covered with asphalt, say China experts who have examined the satellite photos. On Mischief Reef, China has also completed, and started pouring fill into, a retaining wall in a space nearly two miles long — part of a process that is identical to what was done earlier on Subi Reef and Woody Island, where an airfield has been completed, the experts say. The new construction seems certain to strain the meeting between Xi and President Obama, whose national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, was recently in Beijing. The United States has urged China to stop work in the region, and Beijing said in August that it would halt reclamation. But the satellite photos show that construction continues. While the Tuesday commercial satellite photos were taken for CSIS, a separate Sept. 3 satellite photo posted on the Diplomat news Web site Thursday evening showed the same developments. “When the Chinese government said it had mainly finished the work, it clearly hadn’t,” said Michael J. Green, a senior vice president at CSIS and former senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. “This is a challenge for the White House,” Green added. “How do they talk about this? Do they say, ‘Don’t militarize these islands,’ knowing that the Chinese will do it anyway? Do they say, ‘Don’t continue construction,’ when it’s obvious that it will continue anyway?” Green said Chinese officials have told him in private that they intend to militarize the reefs and islands with planes, antiaircraft weapons and naval vessels. He said that would allow the People’s Liberation Army air force to have “overlapping air control over the South China Sea, and not just from one airfield but from three.” He said that “it won’t stop the U.S. policy of asserting freedom of navigation, but it makes it a lot more complicated operation.” The White House did not comment Friday. “We note China’s August statement that it has halted its reclamation. At the same time, China has also stated its intent to further construct facilities, including for the purpose of military defense,” said Cmdr. Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman. “It’s not clear to us that they’ve stopped, and we will continue to watch that situation very closely.” But “the only way to ease tensions is to stop unilateral, destabilizing actions,” he added. “China’s stated intentions with its program, and continued construction, will not reduce tensions or lead to a meaningful diplomatic solution.” Mounting political criticism China claims sovereignty over the entire South China Sea, while its neighbors — Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan — have rival claims. The Obama administration has urged China to settle those claims peacefully through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The new construction comes as political criticism in the United States has mounted over Xi’s visit. Several Republican presidential hopefuls have said that the state dinner with Xi should be canceled because of disagreements over the South China Sea, cyberspace hacking, new restrictive laws on nongovernmental organizations operating in China, theft of intellectual property, and continuing disagreements over human rights. The Senate Armed Services Committee plans to hold hearings Thursday featuring testimony by David Shear, assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, and Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., head of the U.S. Pacific Command. “If China is building two additional airfields at Subi and Mischief reefs, it demonstrates two things,” Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in a statement. “First, that the reclamation has continued despite Beijing’s claims to the contrary. And second, it shows Beijing’s clear intention to militarize the Spratly Islands with airpower using three different man-made islands.” Several of the disputed reefs are within the Spratly Islands. “Along with radars and surface-to-air missiles, this will give China the capability to enforce an air defense identification zone, and hold the waters of the South China Sea at risk should it choose to do so,” McCain continued. The construction also coincides with an unprecedented voyage by five Chinese navy ships through the Bering Sea, close to Alaska’s shores the same week Obama was visiting the state. A U.S. expert on the Chinese military, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect working relationships, said the ships were probably on their way back from exercises held with Russian vessels in the Mediterranean. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Sept. 3 that “these ships were operating in international waters, and there is no indication that their activities were threatening to the United States in any way.” ‘Great wall of sand’ The Pentagon has taken the lead criticizing China’s activities in the South China and East China seas. Although other countries have occupied atolls in the area, China’s size and ambitions have dwarfed those actions. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter sharply criticized China’s activities, noting the large amount of commercial shipping in the South China Sea. Construction on the reefs also endangers the area’s marine ecosystem, environmental groups say. “China is changing the facts on the ground, literally, by essentially building man-made islands on top of coral reefs, rocks and shoals.” Adm. Harris said in a July meeting at the Aspen Security Forum. “I believe that China’s actions to enforce its claims within the South China Sea could have far-reaching consequences for our own security and economy, by disrupting the international rules and norms that have supported the global community for decades.” In March, Harris said that “China is creating a great wall of sand” and warned that its “pattern of provocative actions” was “inconsistent with international law.” He said, “It’s no surprise that the scope and pace of building man-made islands raise serious questions about Chinese intentions.” Harris and other Pentagon officials have said the United States should conduct freedom-of­-navigation operations by flying or sailing within the 12-nautical-mile limit that constitutes a state’s territorial sea. That limit does not apply to Subi Reef, they say, because the reef is not only disputed but was also submerged and therefore not territory at all. But they are at odds with the White House, which is said to oppose any such measure now. “We cannot continue to restrict our Navy from operating within 12 nautical miles of China’s reclaimed features,” McCain said. “This sets a dangerous precedent that grants de facto recognition of China’s man-made claims.”“What does the administration do when Xi Jinping comes to town?” asked Green of CSIS. “I think it’s unlikely that the Chinese side will back down and stop construction.” Missy Ryan contributed to this report.	746	"[{""start"": 2604, ""end"": 2717, ""text"": ""hina has also stated its intent to further construct facilities, including for the purpose of military defense,”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2174, ""end"": 2344, ""text"": ""He said that would allow the People’s Liberation Army air force to have “overlapping air control over the South China Sea, and not just from one airfield but from three.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4550, ""end"": 4776, ""text"": ""Along with radars and surface-to-air missiles, this will give China the capability to enforce an air defense identification zone, and hold the waters of the South China Sea at risk should it choose to do so,” McCain continued."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	724	2023-04-26T15:08:49.046763Z	2023-04-26T15:08:49.046821Z	826.563
BEIJING — The United States announced Thursday it has started joint patrols with the Philippines in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and is ramping up its military presence in the area, a move that China immediately denounced as “Cold War thinking.” In Manila, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the first two patrols took place in March and April and that missions would continue on a regular basis. The deployment comes amid growing concerns about Chinese reach in the strategically and economically important waters of the South China Sea, which borders the Philippines, Vietnam and several other nations. Beijing has built artificial islands and runways on seven disputed reefs, raising fears that China could seek new military outposts in the region. The latest U.S. moves are certain to boost tensions. “Countries across the Asia-Pacific are voicing concern with China’s land reclamation, which stands out in size and scope, as well as its militarization in the South China Sea,” Carter told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. Carter said he will be visiting the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis in the South China Sea on Friday. About 300 U.S. troops, including Air Force crews with combat aircraft and helicopters, will stay in the Philippines through the end of the month. They are among a contingent already taking part in 11 days of combat exercises, the Associated Press reported. Troops and military equipment will also be sent on regular rotations to the Philippines. China, in turn, accuses the United States of militarizing the region as part of President Obama’s strategic rebalance to Asia. It has also pointed to a 2011 deal to station Marines in Darwin, Australia, and a recent announcement allowing U.S. troops access to five bases in the Philippines. “Reinforcing a military alliance is a sign of Cold War thinking, and it runs against the trend of this era — peace, development, cooperation and win-win,” the Ministry of National Defense told China Daily in response to the latest news. Tensions between China and the Philippines have been steadily building ahead of a ruling expected soon from an international tribunal in The Hague on the South China Sea dispute. The government in Manila initiated proceedings after China seized control of Scarborough Shoal in the Spratly Islands in 2012. China says that it will not recognize the tribunal’s decision and that all disputes must be settled bilaterally. The Philippine government worries that China could begin a new program of land reclamation and building on the shoal, which lies 145 miles west of the Philippines and 620 miles from the Chinese coast. The Philippines’ ambassador to Washington, Jose L. Cuisia Jr., recently appealed for U.S. help to block any Chinese expansion. While the United States insists its growing support for allies in the Asia-Pacific region is not aimed at any one nation, officials have openly expressed concerns over Beijing’s actions in the area. Adm. Harry Harris Jr. told Congress in February that China aimed to achieve regional “hegemony.” Last week, the Pentagon announced $40 million in military assistance to the Philippines to beef up intelligence sharing, surveillance and naval patrols. China has built airstrips and appears to be building a sophisticated military radar system in the Spratlys. It also stationed surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets in the Paracel Islands — a separate chain over which China has enjoyed full control since a 1974 naval battle with Vietnam but whose sovereignty Hanoi still bitterly contests. China says those deployments are only for defensive purposes on its sovereign territory. It also argues that the United States did not complain when the Philippines and Vietnam reclaimed land or built airstrips in the South China Sea in the past. Beijing reacted furiously this week to reports that the Philippines was upgrading its own airstrip in the Spratlys, accusing it of hypocrisy and trying to extend its “illegal” occupation. In a testy exchange with reporters in Washington on Tuesday, State Department spokesman Mark Toner appeared reluctant to criticize Manila for its actions, pleading that he did not have details. China also asserts that U.S. “interference” is destabilizing the region and warns that U.S. cooperation with the Philippines should not target a “third party.” “I also want to mention that the U.S. military has kept talking about the so-called militarization in the South China Sea,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a typical comment last month. “Maybe they can explain whether their increased military deployment in the South China Sea and nearby areas is an action of militarization or not?” Chen Xiangmiao, a researcher at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies on China’s southern island of Hainan, said the latest U.S. move was expected but could inflame tensions if the patrols and the increased military presence are viewed as pressuring China. “The United States should not just do things on impulse, which will cause strong resistance from the public in China and distrust among decision-makers here,” he said. “The distrust between the two may get deeper, and the conflicts will rise in a spiral.” Gu Jinglu contributed to this report.	745	"[{""start"": 1511, ""end"": 1801, ""text"": ""China, in turn, accuses the United States of militarizing the region as part of President Obama’s strategic rebalance to Asia.

BEIJING — China said Friday that its military spending will grow by 7 to 8 percent in 2016, the smallest increase in six years and a lower figure than many experts had expected, reflecting a slowing economy and a cut in troop numbers. Although experts say actual spending is significantly higher than the official budget, China’s military spending is still dwarfed by that of the United States, both in monetary terms and as a proportion of the overall economy. Nevertheless, China’s growing military muscle and its robust assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea have sparked concerns throughout Asia, helping propel jumps in defense spending in countries including India, Japan and Vietnam. Fu Ying, spokeswoman for China’s parliament, said the increase reflected the country’s national defense needs as well as the state of its economy and fiscal revenue. The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, had argued this week for double-digit growth in military spending. It also called for China to deploy more weaponry to the South China Sea in response to what it said was Washington’s growing military presence there. Ni Lexiong, a professor of political science and military expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said he had expected an increase of 12 to 15 percent in response to rising regional tensions. “Obviously it shows that China wants to demonstrate to the West, including the U.S. and the neighboring countries that it has disputes with, that China sincerely wants to solve the problems through peaceful means,” he said. “But the second reason is that China’s economy is bad indeed.” China’s President Xi Jinping is trying to modernize and streamline the country’s military, seeking to make it more effective and simultaneously curb corruption. The People’s Liberation Army is being trimmed by 300,000 troops, but the 2-million-member force is still the world’s largest standing army. The increase would be the first single-digit boost in defense spending since 2010, when the budget rose 7.5 percent, and is below the 10.1 percent boost in last year’s budget. It is roughly in line with official economic growth of 6.9 percent in 2015 and would take the military budget to around $150 billion, about a quarter of Pentagon spending of nearly $600 billion last year. In relation to the overall economy, China’s official defense budget amounts to 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 3.1 percent in the United States. China has been repeatedly criticized by the United States for a massive land-reclamation effort in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. But at a news conference ahead of the opening session of China’s National People’s Congress, Fu rejected Washington’s argument that China is militarizing the strategically important waters. “Talking about militarization, if you look at it carefully, most of the advanced aircraft and warships passing through the South China Sea belong to the United States,” she said. Fu argued that President Obama’s strategic re-balance to Asia, as well as recent U.S. naval operations, with warships sailing close to Chinese-controlled islands in the disputed Spratly chain, had raised tensions and heightened emotions. “Chinese people think that it’s not good that the U.S. sent military ships to areas so close to Spratly Islands to show off its military, and this very much disgusts the Chinese people,” she said. “Originally on the Spratly issue, the United States said that it did not take sides. But the acts and words of the United States now are stimulating intense emotions in many people, which draws a big question mark over the motives of the United States.” The United States says its naval operations are designed to underline the principle of freedom of navigation through international waters and insists it takes no sides in the territorial dispute. This week, the U.S. Navy said it had dispatched an aircraft carrier and several other ships to the South China Sea on what was described as a routine patrol. The carrier, the USS John C. Stennis, arrived in the South China Sea on Tuesday, in a region where China has recently deployed surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets, and is thought to be building a military radar facility. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that China’s actual military spending is more than 50 percent above the budgeted figure when items such as military research and development, arms imports, military construction and pension costs are taken into account. In 2014, the institute’s broader measure of military spending scored China as spending 2.1 percent of GDP, compared with the United States at 3.5 percent.

MANILA — China’s most daring adversary in Southeast Asia is, by many measurements, ill-suited for a fight. The Philippines has a military budget one-fortieth the size of Beijing’s, and its navy cruises through contested waters in 1970s hand-me-downs from the South Vietnamese. From that short-handed position, the Philippines has set off on a risky mission to do what no nation in the region has managed to do: thwart China in its drive to control the vast waters around it. Analysts say the Philippines’ strategy, in standing up to Asia’s powerhouse, is just as likely to backfire as succeed. But it provides a crucial test case as smaller countries debate whether to deal with China as a much-needed economic partner, a dangerous maritime aggressor, or both. The Philippines doesn’t view China exclusively as a threat, officials here say, noting that trade between the countries is growing. The Philippines has also used caution at times, most notably by holding off on provocative plans to drill in what could be the nation’s richest oil and gas field. But analysts point to a series of steps taken in recent months that suggest that Manila is increasingly willing to confront Beijing. They also note that the Philippines has suspended or canceled several development deals that depended on generous Chinese aid. Earlier this year, the Philippines filed a case with the United Nations contesting China’s maritime claims. More recently, the Philippines has increased its manpower on disputed islands, approved upgrades to decrepit military equipment and discussed plans that would give the United States expanded access to Philippine air and naval bases. Speaking to his armed forces in May, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III said the nation needed to protect its maritime territory from “bullies.” Battles over territory in Asia go back centuries, but China has made an increasingly aggressive play in recent years to recover land that it says fell wrongly into foreign hands. China has made a case for ownership of nearly the entire South China Sea, marking its territory with a nine-dash line on a map that it submitted to the United Nations in 2009. At least four other neighbors — Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam — are skirmishing with China over the tiny islands and the waters within that boundary. They covet sovereignty not just as a matter of pride but also to claim rich fisheries and underwater oil and gas resources. But they have reason to tread cautiously. China is Malaysia’s largest trading partner. Brunei depends on China as a market for its fossil fuel exports. Taiwan’s president, Ma Ying-jeou, has fostered a major improvement in relations with Beijing. Comparatively, Vietnam has been more willing to anger China. The two nations have a legacy of centuries of animosity, including a brief border war in 1979 and more recent clashes at sea. But the two are also communist partners, capable of patching up frayed ties. Some Filipinos say their country is more suited than others in the region to play tough with China. The Philippines has deep ties to Washington, stemming from a U.S. colonial period that ended in 1946. China and the Philippines took opposite sides in the wars in Korea and Vietnam, as well as in the Cold War. Political experts here say the Philippines’ strategy on China is being mapped out by its foreign affairs secretary, Albert del Rosario, a former ambassador to Washington. Aquino is said to be fully on board with the policy. Del Rosario last year called on the Philippines to “take a position of patriotism that what is ours is ours.” “It is possible that we may be tested,” he said, “and if we are tested, it is possible that everyone would need to make a sacrifice.” Collapse of goodwill Just a few years ago, China tried to make friends with the Philippines — and nearly succeeded. The reason it fell short indicates the limits of soft power — namely, aid and investment deals — at a time when China has made a priority of expanding its foreign influence. Under the previous Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Beijing showered Manila with more than $2 billion in loans. Some of the money was meant for railroad projects. An additional $330 million was designed to fund a broadband network that would connect 25,000 municipal offices. As the money was flowing, the Philippines signed off on what Arroyo called a “diplomatic breakthrough” — a tripartite deal that allowed China and Vietnam to survey contested maritime territory near Philippine shores, in the hope of joint oil and gas development. The goodwill collapsed in short order. The broadband deal was laced with kickbacks for Philippine officials, as a congressional investigation revealed. The joint surveying deal came under even fiercer attack, as opposition politicians and many prominent Filipinos said Arroyo had violated the constitution by essentially giving away territory. Although the Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking (JMSU) was never described by Arroyo as a quid pro quo for economic cooperation, it was signed in 2005, when relations with Beijing were at their best. “In my opinion, it was a sellout,” said Rommel Banlaoi, chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research. “The terms of the JMSU were so biased. Only areas of the Philippines were allowed for exploration.” Arroyo, under domestic pressure, allowed the initial three-year JMSU contract to lapse in 2008. But the collapse of the deal reopened a decades-long debate between the Philippines and China over the rights to seabed hydrocarbons. The Philippines worked out unilateral deals to prospect for oil and gas. And China, in turn, increased its surveillance of the waters, badgering Philippine vessels in places where they had previously gone unbothered. None of the standoffs have turned violent, but in March 2011, Manila accused two Chinese coast guard boats of harassing a Philippines-commissioned oil exploration vessel near Reed Bank, a promising drilling site about 80 nautical miles off the coast of Palawan, the Philippines’ western­most major island. The Philippines has since put the project on hold, citing political tensions. That holdup has proved to be the most costly repercussion of the row with China. The Philippines had been exploring the Reed Bank for nearly four decades and considered it crucial to the energy security of a nation that imports most of its fossil fuels from the Middle East. “This site could be earning $1 billion per year for the Philippines,” said Ismael Ocampo, assistant director at the Energy Department in Manila. “So, yes, this holdup is costly.” A vocal minority in the Philippines says that Aquino should re-embrace China and again pursue joint development. “Right now, nobody’s getting rich,” said Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House under Arroyo, who helped broker deals with China. “Here, we are getting zero resources. And not only that, but also a lot of stress and problems.” Island disputes Aside from standoffs between vessels at sea, China and the Philippines have only the most furtive maritime contact, as each monitors the activities of the other around the South China Sea’s tiny islands, reefs and sandbars. China and the Philippines, along with Vietnam, have spent recent years establishing settlements on these islands on a first-come basis. The Philippines inhabits nine of the 53 such rocks or islands that it considers its own, citing a U.N. maritime treaty. The Vietnamese have claimed 22, though without eliciting quite the same scorn from Filipinos as China. Meanwhile, China has placed an estimated 1,000 troops on seven islands. It has turned one tiny reef into a concrete fortress with a windmill and a basketball court. Philippine officials see little chance that the Chinese will withdraw. “It’s like they have already invaded us,” said Eugenio Bito-Onon, mayor of the Philippine-claimed islands, which are an official municipality.

OBAMA-PUTIN SUMMIT? After over a year of deep freeze, President Obama is mulling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of U.N. General Assembly, the New York Times reports, primarily to talk solution on Syria. Both Russia and the United States want to neuter the Islamic State. But they can’t agree on how to do it: The United States would also like to see Syrian President Bashar al-Assad go, while Russia maintains Assad is the only one with the strength to defeat the Islamist militants and the legitimacy, such as it is, to lead a divided country after a brutal, punishing war. CHINA’S NEW AIRSTRIP. So much for that rampdown in the South China Sea. Instead, the Chinese appear to be building a third airstrip, The Washington Post reports, and this one will be able to accommodate almost any kind of aircraft the Chinese military wants to throw at it. The buildup is all part of China’s claim to sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea – claims that are easier to make over waters contiguous to sovereign pieces of land. Or, as the commander of China’s North Sea fleet told a group in London, the mere name “South China Sea” is proof enough of China’s legitimate claim. INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS TO BE UNVEILED. After much resistance, the CIA is preparing to make public thousands of daily intelligence reports – the briefings the spy service gives to the president — Politico reports. They reports are old, of course – dating from the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. But they will potentially detail the behind-the-scenes intelligence-gathering and reasoning that went on during some of the era’s most tense chapters, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Six-Day War in the Middle East, and the run-up to the Vietnam War. The unveiling is set for a conference in Austin, Tex., on Wednesday.	742	"[{""start"": 883, ""end"": 1057, ""text"": ""The buildup is all part of China’s claim to sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea – claims that are easier to make over waters contiguous to sovereign pieces of land."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	720	2023-04-26T14:31:49.822748Z	2023-04-26T14:31:49.822848Z	99.362
"Over 200 Chinese moviegoers attended a screening on Yongxing Island in the South China Sea on Saturday, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The cinema is operated by Hainan Film Company and comes with up-to-date technology, the agency reported, including both 4K resolution and a 3-D perforated screen. The new movie theater has received widespread attention in Beijing's state-run media — with Xinhua describing it as “China's southernmost cinema.” But its opening also plays a more controversial role in one of Asia's most fraught territorial disputes. Yongxing Island, known internationally as Woody Island, is the largest of the Paracel Islands. These islands are in a part of the South China Sea claimed simultaneously by China, Vietnam and Taiwan — part of a broader set of geopolitical disputes in the sea that also involve many Southeast Asian nations. China has long claimed much of the islands, reefs and atolls in this sea, pointing toward a historical claim known as the ""nine-dash line.” Disputes over the geographically useful region have long been a recurring theme of diplomacy. Last year, an international court in The Hague rejected most of China's claims in the region. The United States has challenged China's sovereignty in the area and has sailed Navy destroyers through the contested waters as recently as early July. Beijing has dismissed international condemnation and instead worked to build up its presence on the tiny and often isolated islands it claims in the South China Sea. Many of these moves serve a military purpose: Last year, China was reported to have moved advanced surface-to-air missiles to Woody Island. But Beijing has also made clear efforts to create a livable city for residents on these islands. In 2012, China set up a prefecture-level city named Sansha on Woody Island, soon unveiling structures such as a school and a hospital and even setting up a 4G mobile signal network. Xinhua reports that the city “also has a stadium and has organized various cultural activities to enrich the lives of residents.” The greater purpose of these civilian-minded infrastructure installations may still be military — last year, a Chinese military newspaper reported that three-quarters of residents were military personnel who need something to do in their downtime. (The total number of residents is thought to be up to 2,000.) There has also been talk of turning the islands into a patriotic tourist destination or even an offshore banking hub. Gu Xiaojing, general manager of Hainan Media Group, told Xinhua that there will be “at least one film” screened every day, so that “residents and soldiers on Yongxing Island can enjoy films simultaneously with moviegoers across the country.” The plan is to screen blockbusters, and local authorities have also purchased mobile projection units that can be taken to other islands held by China in the area. The movie screened on Saturday was titled “The Eternity of Jiao Yulu,” Xinhua reported. It is a documentary about the life of a Chinese Communist Party politician who is said to have worked hard and honestly before his death in the 1960s and is now held up as a hero in state-sanctioned history, though critics say the reality of Jiao's life is not clear.
