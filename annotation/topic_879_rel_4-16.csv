NEW DELHI — The Delhi government announced an emergency plan Friday to curb the capital’s pollution levels, among the worst in the world, by limiting drivers to alternate days beginning next month. From Jan. 1, residents of the city, which had been choking in thick smog in recent days, will be able to drive only every other day according to their license plate numbers — odd numbers on one day, even numbers on the other. They also plan to shut down Delhi’s large coal-fired power plant and make Euro VI emission norms mandatory for motor vehicles from 2017. Delhi’s chief minister said at a forum over the weekend that the alternate-day traffic schedule was an “emergency” measure and would be discontinued if a trial period proved it to be unworkable. Delhi’s police have already complained they don’t have the manpower to enforce it. “We don’t want to cause any inconvenience to the public,” Arvind Kejriwal said. The plan was announced after the state of Delhi’s high court issued a directive Thursday ordering the state and national governments as well as the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to devise a plan by Dec. 21 to address rising levels of air pollution. “It seems like we are living in a gas chamber,” said the court, which is based in the capital city. New Delhi’s air — a noxious combination of exhaust, dust, smoke from wood and dung-fired stoves, burning leaves and industrial output — surpassed Beijing’s last year as the dirtiest in the world, according to a study by the World Health Organization. On Friday, its concentration of particulate matter — the airborne particles that enter people’s lungs and pose a major health threat — was a “hazardous” 652 at one point in the afternoon, compared with an “unhealthy” 180 in Mumbai and Hyderabad, two other major Indian cities. Officials say they hope the measure will reduce pollution levels by 50 percent. They also plan to shut down Delhi’s large coal-fired power plant and make Euro VI emission norms mandatory for motor vehicles from 2017. “This is being done for the interests of the citizens and the public,” Delhi state’s chief secretary, K.K. Sharma, said in a meeting with reporters. “We expect the public to cooperate.” The capital’s most recent effort to regulate polluters — a ban on diesel vehicles older than 10 years — descended into chaos this year, with traffic jams at checkpoints and city officials arguing that enforcing the policy was impossible. “We must move toward reforms, but we have to be practical,” said Harsh Vardhan, a physician who is India’s minister of science and technology. “Also, don’t say something you can’t implement.” The city’s smog is always bad in winter, but it has been unusually thick in recent days, exacerbated by fireworks set off for the festival of lights, Diwali, on Nov. 11. The air quality worsened sevenfold from the start of October to the end of November, according to a study by the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi, which showed that 3 percent of days in October and 73 percent in November had severe air quality. “Clearly there has been a huge increase,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, the center’s executive director for research and advocacy and head of its air pollution and clean transportation program. “These levels are several times higher than the standard. This has serious health impacts.” She said that the new pollution-control plan would be a catalyst for drivers to think of alternative ways to commute — by car pooling, limiting their trips or by traveling on foot or by bicycle. The capital’s last significant push for cleaner air began in the late 1990s, when the government closed small polluting factories and switched all buses and auto rickshaws from diesel to compressed natural gas. But the gains made after the switch began to decline about 2008 when the number of motor vehicles began to increase, Roychowdhury said. The rationing of road use has been practiced in large cities in Latin America and elsewhere for more than two decades. In Beijing, motorists cannot drive in the city center one day a week. London uses “congestion pricing” — a fee on driving in the city’s core that is about $17 a day on weekdays. But some environmental activists said implementation would be difficult in the sprawling India capital, with 16 million residents and 2 million registered motor vehicles. Although city officials said Friday that they would increase bus service and extend times for Metro service, they are still about 10,000 buses short of demand, according to Amit Bhatt, a sustainable-transportation expert in New Delhi. “It will be very challenging,” said Bhatt, the head of transportation at the EMBARQ program in the India branch of the World Resources Institute. When a system of alternate days was launched in Bogota, Colombia, Bhatt said, many residents simply bought cheap second cars, choosing vehicles with license plates to complement their primary vehicles so that they could drive every day. Bogota eventually switched the odd-even number system to peak hours only, which has been more successful, Bhatt said. Yet such moves do reduce the harmful particulate matter in the air, Bhatt said. To tap that benefit, his group has co-created voluntary car-free days in New Delhi and Gurgaon, a suburb. Gurgaon has voluntary car-free Tuesdays in four major corridors. On Tuesdays, particulate pollution drops sharply, Bhatt said. Read more: Indian city’s historic rainfall — nature’s fury or construction frenzy?

About 5.5 million people around the world die prematurely every year from breathing polluted air, and the majority of those deaths are occurring in China and India, where factories and coal-fired power plants are fueling economic growth, according to a report released Friday. The authors said the findings show that disease from air and household pollution ranks as the number two cause of death worldwide. It comes in right behind smoking, which the World Health Organization says kills 6 million people annually. The research, part of an initiative to monitor the global burden of disease, is being presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington. Air pollution is made up of fine particulate matter from power generation, transportation and open burning. Household pollution is created by stoves that burn coal, wood and animal dung for cooking and heat, primarily in India and Africa. Both can lead to heart attacks and strokes, and the researchers found that nearly 1 million people die annually from these causes in China, more than a half-million die in India, and nearly 300,000 die in the United States and European Union countries. Although the report used 2013 data, co-author Dan Greenbaum, president of the nonprofit Health Effects Institute in Boston, noted that “these things don’t change overnight.” Last year’s death toll likely was similar, he said.  // <![CDATA[ // ]]> The Chinese government is moving aggressively to improve air quality by forcing automobiles there to be equipped with cleaner technology, and power plants to lower the amount of particulates they spew. But gains are offset by the country’s drive to become a world economic power — through the very industries it seeks to better regulate. The United States, where yearly deaths from air pollution fell from 119,000 to 79,000 between 1990 and 2013, and the European Union, where they fell from 350,000 to 218,000 over the same period, stand as models for China, Greenbaum said. The United States continues to push for lower emissions from automobile traffic and has imposed stronger rules on industry, such as cement plants and those that generate electricity from coal. // <![CDATA[ // ]]> China’s worsening air pollution is a problem far beyond its borders, with previous studies showing that it marginally increases air pollution on the U.S. West Coast. At the AAAS meeting, Greenbaum said, a Chinese scientist is set to present an analysis showing that “coal is by far the largest health burden, about 50 percent of the problem.” Report co-author Qiao Ma, a doctoral student at the School of Environment at Tsinghua University in Beijing, found that outdoor air pollution from coal contributed to about 366,000 Chinese deaths in 2013. According to her projection, between 990,000 and 1.3 million people there will lose their lives prematurely by 2030 unless ambitious pollution-reduction targets are introduced. “Our study highlights the urgent need for even more aggressive strategies to reduce emissions from coal and from other sectors,” Ma said in a statement. Air pollution is “by far the leading environmental risk factor for disease,” Michael Brauer, another co-author and professor at the University of British Columbia’s School of Population and Public Health in Vancouver, said in the statement. “Reducing air pollution is an incredibly efficient way to improve the health of a population.” India has moved to reduce household pollution, but not with the same urgency as China. “It’s harder to solve the household problems because these are poor families that can’t convert to electric stoves,” Greenbaum said. “People who are in the kitchen, women primarily, are exposed to extremely high levels of pollution.”  But Indian officials are intent on regulating what they can, said Chandra Venkataraman, a professor of chemical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, who analyzed pollution there as part of the report. Emission standards legislation has been introduced in the wake of the international climate agreement reached last December in Paris. And policies are in place to move the country from coal-burning heavy industry. Venkataraman said officials also want to end a standard Indian practice of widespread burning to clear agricultural fields. As part of a national cook-stove initiative, about 110 million households now have stoves that burn bio-matter, she said in a telephone interview. “But it’s not a centralized problem, it’s all over the country. And it’s not just a technological problem, it’s an issue of awareness.”	347	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 276, ""text"": ""5.5 million people around the world die prematurely every year from breathing polluted air, and the majority of those deaths are occurring in China and India, where factories and coal-fired power plants are fueling economic growth, according to a report released Friday."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 816, ""end"": 945, ""text"": ""Household pollution is created by stoves that burn coal, wood and animal dung for cooking and heat, primarily in India and Africa"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 945, ""end"": 990, ""text"": "".

It’s a never-ending debate in Asia -- whose air quality is worse, China’s or India’s? A new study by Greenpeace released Monday is trying to answer that question. Analysts looked at NASA satellite images and found that measurements of particulate matter -- the microscopic particles that invade your lungs and can cause cancer and heart disease -- improved impressively in China over the past few years while air quality in India has worsened, with 2015 ranking as India’s most polluted year on record. The satellite images showed that the levels of PM2.5 particles decreased by 17 percent in China from 2010 to 2015 and 15 percent in the United States while rising 13 percent in India, the study found. For the first time, Greenpeace found, the average Indian citizen was exposed to more particulate matter than the average Chinese. The images below from Greenpeace show China's air quality worsening, then improving -- while India's has steadily worsened: The study also found that the average annual PM2 level for India's capital, New Delhi, was also higher than in Beijing -- an average of 81 for Beijing, 128 for Delhi and 12 for Washington, D.C. China has made a concerted effort to address its air pollution problem in recent years after widespread public outcry over filthy air that put pressure on the government to release better pollution data. The Greenpeace study credits China’s national pollution action plan launched in 2013 for its “impressive” improvement. That included tightening emission standards for coal-fired power plants and heavy industry and increasing emissions monitoring and enforcement. However, the study notes that pollution levels in China remain “alarmingly high.” Meanwhile, in India, public outrage has only just begun to coalesce around the problem. Indian newspapers have run high-profile series on air pollution in recent months and the Delhi government has instituted an odd-even day driving plan this winter to control the worsening air. The study suggests that India should put in place a pollution action plan that sweeps from Punjab to West Bengal in the northern part of the country, where pollution is the worst, enforce compliance for coal-fired power plants and institute air quality monitoring systems for all major urban centers. India has a dearth of online monitoring systems in place in its cities -- only 39 such stations compared to 1,500 in China, 770 in the United States and 1,000 in Europe, the study found.

"NEW DELHI –The thick winter haze that settles over Delhi – a nasty mix of smog, vehicle exhaust and smoke from cooking fires – abated somewhat when President Obama arrived in India this week for talks. A bit of rain came and cleared the air. Even so, the air quality index hovered around 200 when the president arrived at the viewing stand to watch India’s Republic Day Parade on Monday. That’s approaching what’s deemed a “very unhealthy” level of the microscopic 2.5 particulate matter, which causes respiratory disease and other ailments. [Read: On Obama’s India visit, climate-change deal unlikely as Modi boosts coal production] The Americans were prepared. Delhi police had kept traffic to a minimum around the parade route, and the Embassy ordered 1,800 Swedish air purifiers in the weeks preceding the American delegations’ arrival. (It’s not clear whether any of those air filters actually made it into Obama’s special bullet-proof parade enclosure, as the Indian media had reported.) Bloomberg published a story Monday titled “Mr. President, World’s Worst Air is Taking 6 Hours Off Your Life,” which argued that Delhi’s toxic air was so harmful that it could shorten the president’s longevity. “I think in Delhi, I think particularly at this time of the year, the air quality deteriorates,” John Podesta, counselor to the president, said to reporters in Delhi on Sunday. “But I think we weren’t concerned about bringing the president here for these meetings.” The air in New Delhi is the worst in the world, according to a World Health Organization report last year. Environmentalists say that efforts to control it – such as a switch to clean-burning natural gas for auto rickshaws – have made little long-term impact as the city has sprawled, eight coal-fired power plants chugged out more power and more than 7 million cars clogged the roads. The situation is hardly better in in other parts of the country. Earlier this year, a report by a Yale University research team showed that India ranked 174th of 178 countries in air quality, somewhere close to China and Pakistan. On Sunday, the president and Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the two countries would work to battle pollution in India’s cities by implementing the Environmental Protection Agency’s international air quality forecasting system AIRNow. It’s part of an overall climate deal that includes a pledge for “concrete progress” on a pact to phase out a class of widely used refrigerants called hydrofluorocarbons, and support for solar energy initiatives to help India reach its goal of expanding its solar energy capacity to 100 gigawatts by 2022, an amount equal to the energy of about 100 nuclear power plants. Administration officials acknowledged that Modi-Obama did not produce a breakthrough like the deal with China on emissions last fall. But they said that it represented significant progress from a still-developing country that has long balked at agreeing to significant curbs on its emissions. They say the rapport that seemed to develop between Obama and Modi during this trip – Modi served Obama’s tea, and Obama kidded him about being attacked by a crocodile – may go a long way in helping the United States achieve a strong a global climate agreement in Paris with India’s help later this year. “This signals that India sees the Paris agreement as a priority, and establishes a direct channel that could prove absolutely essential to delivering the final deal,” said Elliot Diringer, vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a Washington environmental group. At a meeting with chief executives Monday, Modi called for “global action on renewable energy,” saying the world “should take a lesson from past efforts to tackle hunger and many diseases.” However, other environmentalists expressed disappointment that the agreement between the two countries did not specifically target carbon emissions, especially as India doubles its coal production to try to  meet unrelenting power needs. India is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind the United States and China. Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago, pointed to Modi’s somewhat short response to a reporter’s question about whether he felt pressured to agree to a China-style climate deal with the United States. “The sad thing for India is that while in rejecting a China-type deal, Modi said, 'There is no pressure on us from any country or any person, but there is pressure when we think about the future generations and what kind of world we want to give them,' "" Pierrehumbert said. “In attempting to provide adequate energy, if India goes with coal to the extent in current plans, Modi will be leaving future generations in India — already one of the hottest populous countries — to suffer under oppressive warming so severe that, according to some projections, mammals (and that includes people) will not be able to survive outdoors,” he said.

NEW DELHI — Mask-wearing protesters took to the streets of the Indian capital Sunday as the city remained blanketed under a cloud of toxic smoke that has lingered for a week and sparked anger at the government’s slow response. Thousands of schools have been shuttered, cricket matches canceled and residents warned to stay inside as the air pollution crisis in New Delhi and the surrounding metropolitan region — deemed an “emergency situation” by the environment minister Saturday — stretched into its seventh day. Patients with breathing problems inundated hospitals and clinics, and residents waited in line to buy pricey face masks — which often sold out. “We have never seen something like this. This time, things are really bad,” said P.S. Walia, 44, a father of two who was at a protest Sunday. He has shuttered his house, stopped taking morning walks and kept his kids indoors this past week to protect them from the stinging air. Experts said low winds, holiday fireworks residue and crop-burning in neighboring states contributed to the haze, which reduced visibility at the airport to a 17-year low last week. Air-quality data from the U.S. Embassy’s air monitor — which measures the particulate pollutant known as PM 2.5 — averaged 640 this week, more than six times the level deemed acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency. On Sunday, Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said the city would undertake emergency measures to address the “need of the hour,” including banning construction activity for five days, limiting diesel-generator use, water-treating dusty roads and temporarily closing a coal-fired power plant. The city’s schools will remain shut for three days, he said. Environmental experts applauded the move but say the city — the 11th-most-polluted in the world, according to the World Health Organization — needs far more stringent long-term solutions. Last week, the country’s environmental court had chided both the central and state governments for “shifting blame” and not taking action to address the problem. “Emergency measures are an absolute necessity right now because the levels we are seeing are too horrendous,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, head of the Center for Science and Environment’s air pollution and clean transportation program. But longer-term fixes — expanding public transport, permanently closing aging coal-fired plants and controlling waste-burning — are necessary, she said. Kejriwal said Saturday that farmers in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana had illegally burned 16 to 20 million tons of crop waste in the past month, turning the capital into a “gas chamber.” The states’ environment ministers are set to meet Monday to come up with a plan to address the problem. “So much is caused by the burning of crops. The government has to do something,” Satish Mittal, a roadside tea-stall owner, said Sunday. Kejriwal’s government has made attempts to control pollution, including two trials of a controversial plan this year to limit car use by odd- or even-number license plates, a program that reduced traffic but did not have the dramatic effect on air quality some had hoped for. Hundreds gathered for a protest walk in the tech suburb of Gurgaon on Saturday and at a rally near Parliament in New Delhi on Sunday. There, the masked protesters were joined by schoolchildren with hand-lettered signs that said “Be the solution to the pollution” and “Help Delhi Breathe.” One of the organizers, Shivani Gupta, 41, a jewelry designer, said her son — who has become severely asthmatic — was hospitalized three times last year because of pollution. The family has even taken to wearing protective masks inside their house. “My husband is sick, and my child is sick,” she said. “This is not how we can live our lives.” Swati Gupta contributed to this report.

A new paper has added to the growing body of research indicating that India’s air pollution has become a matter of life and death. The study, published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that outdoor air pollution in the country is contributing to more than half a million premature deaths each year at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars. The deadly power of air pollution is no new finding. Numerous studies have concluded that both outdoor and indoor pollution can cause a variety of serious diseases, including ischemic heart disease, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, increased risk of stroke and even lung cancer. One study published last year in Nature, for instance, estimated that a type of pollution known as “fine particulate matter” — tiny toxic particles that can be released by a variety of sources, including the burning of fossil fuels or organic matter — is responsible for about 3 million deaths worldwide each year.   In certain parts of the world, particularly India and China, air pollution is an ever-growing public health concern. This may be especially true for India, which reportedly surpassed China earlier this year in the overall amount of fine particulate matter pollution its citizens are exposed to. That report, which was published in February by Greenpeace, found that fine particulate matter levels in New Delhi came to about 128 micrograms per cubic meter, in comparison to Beijing’s 81 and Washington D.C.’s 12.  In contrast, the World Health Organization recommends that nations shoot for an annual average of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.  The authors of this week’s paper have pointed out that most studies that model pollution-related mortality have focused on Europe and the United States, with comparatively few studies on mostly urban areas in India. A few broad studies have attempted to produce estimates for the globe as a whole, including regional estimates for India or South Asia — these included two independent 2015 studies and a 2014 World Health Organization report, all of which suggested that pollution-related premature deaths were above 0.5 or 0.6 million annually. The new study, which focuses specifically on India, further supports those estimates. The study relied on computer simulations of outdoor air pollution levels throughout the nation — including both fine particulate matter and ozone, which is also known to cause respiratory disease — using data from national inventories on pollutant emissions. The researchers then used a model (relying on previous research on the human health response to pollution exposure) to estimate the number of associated premature deaths. All the simulations were based on 2011 data. Their results suggested that about 570,000 premature deaths in India were caused by exposure to fine particulate matter in 2011, and an additional 12,000 were caused by exposure to ozone. The most severely affected part of the country was the Indo-Gangetic region, which includes the northern strip of the country. “[It’s] good to see that the results from this study are in good agreement with our work, which shows that these numbers are quite robust, and that air pollution is indeed an important cause of premature death,” said Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, who led one of the 2015 global studies on pollution and premature mortality. Lelieveld was not involved with the new study. In addition, Marko Tainio of the University of Cambridge (who was also not involved with the research) noted that the results are well in line with estimates produced by the 2013 Global Burden of Disease study (GBD), which is a collaborative effort among the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and other academic partners, which quantifies the health effects of various diseases and injuries around the world. “The paper in Geophysical Research Letters used similar methods than the ones in the GBD study so I would have expected similar results,” he said by email. In all of these cases, there is no physical way to tell who has actually been killed by air pollution. Rather, the methods rely on statistical algorithms (computer models, essentially) to construct estimates about a population’s response to pollution exposure using previous concrete observations on pollution and public health. The problem is that most of these observational studies have taken place in regions with comparatively low pollution levels, such as Europe or the U.S., said Michael Jerrett, chair of the department of environmental health sciences at the University of California Los Angeles, who was not involved with the new research.   “We don’t have any epidemiological studies from China or India that look at the long-term effects of air pollution on mortality,” he said. That means that modeling studies on health and pollution in these places are essentially extrapolating human responses to high pollution levels using results from less polluted places — meaning scientists can’t quite know for sure whether the results produced by the models are completely true to real life. This makes the method slightly controversial among some scientists, Jerrett noted. However, it’s also one of the only available options for this type of research until the missing studies are conducted in those parts of the world. Additionally, Jerrett said that these types of modeling studies are forced to assume that all types of particles included in fine particulate matter pollution — which may include a variety of different substances, including heavy metals, acids or carbon compounds — are equally toxic, which research suggests is likely not the case. Emissions containing varying concentrations of different particles may affect human health in different ways. For the time being, though, there’s not much that can be done to correct for this issue in existing models. And overall, Jerrett agreed that this particular paper “looks like it’s a well-conducted study building on a longer research tradition.” In addition to estimating the number of premature mortalities across the nation, the researchers converted these calculations into years of life lost. They concluded that exposure to fine particulate matter in India translated to about 3.4 life years lost. “This is a point of concern because overall average life expectancy is already low (64 years) in India, ranked 150 worldwide in 2012, and future increase in PM2.5 concentration may worsen the situation,” the researchers wrote. The researchers also estimated the economic cost of the mortalities using a function known as “value of a statistical life,” or VSL — essentially, the monetary value of a change in a person’s likelihood of dying. This is sometimes thought of as the amount of money a society would be willing to spend to save an individual citizen’s life. This value generally differs by country and depends on factors such as growth in gross domestic product and income.   From these calculations, the researchers concluded that the cost of the estimated premature mortalities came to about $640 billion in 2011 — notably, about 10 times higher than the country’s total expenditures on health that year.   Altogether, although there are still some uncertainties associated with the methods, the paper adds to an ever-increasing collection of studies highlighting the dramatic health consequences of heavy pollution. And it’s worth noting that this particular study did not even include the effects of indoor air pollution, from sources such as indoor cooking and heating, which are also known to contribute to similar health problems.   “Our estimates on premature mortalities, economic loss and life lost years provides important information to elective  members  and  policy  makers  to  propose  or  impose  emission  controls  to  benefit reduced public health risk due to exposure to outdoor air pollution,” the authors wrote. And Jerrett added that more stringent standards for air pollution control may also help lead to a decrease in the kinds of emissions that contribute to global warming. This means that stricter pollution control in India would not only help save lives in that part of the world, but would also be a win for the planet as a whole.	336	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 130, ""text"": ""paper has added to the growing body of research indicating that India’s air pollution has become a matter of life and death."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 131, ""end"": 376, ""text"": ""The study, published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that outdoor air pollution in the country is contributing to more than half a million premature deaths each year at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 430, ""end"": 661, ""text"": ""Numerous studies have concluded that both outdoor and indoor pollution can cause a variety of serious diseases, including ischemic heart disease, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, increased risk of stroke and even lung cancer."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 979, ""end"": 1272, ""text"": ""In certain parts of the world, particularly India and China, air pollution is an ever-growing public health concern.
