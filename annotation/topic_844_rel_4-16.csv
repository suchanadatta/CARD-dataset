WHEN ONE of his colleagues at Mexico City’s daily newspaper was gunned down in March, Javier Valdez issued a passionate statement about the importance of the work of journalists who cover the network of organized crime, drug trafficking and corruption that plagues Mexico.“Let them kill us all, if that is the death sentence for reporting this hell,” he tweeted. “No to silence.” The words proved horribly prophetic when Mr. Valdez last week became the latest casualty of the drug-fueled violence that has claimed tens of thousands of Mexican lives over the past decade. The life and death of this courageous reporter should serve as inspiration and prod to the Mexican government to undertake reforms needed to end the impunity that allows the country’s lawlessness to flourish. Mr. Valdez, 50, was shot and killed at midday May 15 on a busy street in the northwest state of Sinaloa. Authorities said unidentified attackers fired 12 shots at his car. Sinaloa is a drug trafficking destination perhaps best known as the home of Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán; Mr. Valdez, a correspondent for La Jornada, co-founded a regional weekly newspaper there in 2003 because of his belief in the need for honest reporting of the crime and corruption that victimize Mexicans — despite the risks. He is the sixth journalist to be killed in Mexico this year and one of more than 100 journalists who have been murdered since 2000. Eleven days before Mr. Valdez’s death, a delegation from the Committee to Protect Journalists met with President Enrique Peña Nieto to present its newly released report “No Excuse: Mexico Must Break Cycle of Impunity in Journalists’ Murders.” Among the recommendations were better protections for at-risk journalists, timely investigation of threats and training prosecutors in how to pursue crimes against freedom of expression. It’s good that Mr. Peña Nieto immediately and strongly condemned Mr. Valdez’s murder, but that is clearly not enough. Recommendations of the CPJ report should be embraced, and the chronic failure of the judicial system in investigating and prosecuting crimes must be addressed. A good place to start is making a priority of finding those who shot Mr. Valdez and those who ordered it.

As the number of Mexican journalists killed for doing their jobs has spiked in recent months, organizations trying to draw attention to the murders have had to use stronger language to describe the epidemic. Amnesty International said it was “open season” on journalists and described a “war” against the media. The British human rights organization Article 19 described a “new peak” in violence. But a scathing new report by the Committee to Protect Journalists described the violence with a pointed word: preventable. The committee said government indifference and rampant corruption have contributed strongly to the attacks on journalists. “Endemic impunity allows criminal gangs, corrupt officials, and cartels to silence their critics,” the CPJ said in its report, released Wednesday, which was World Press Freedom Day. “Despite federal government efforts to combat this deadly cycle, justice remains elusive, and impunity the norm.” According to the CPJ, between 2006 and 2016, 21 journalists were killed in Mexico. The country ranks sixth on the organization's index of journalist killings that go unpunished. “The messenger risks being a victim of the story he or she investigates, at times at the hands of government officials, police commanders, common criminals, and drug traffickers who go unpunished,” wrote Adela Navarro Bello, director of Tijuana-based Zeta magazine, which is under police protection after authorities learned that a cartel planned to attack its headquarters. Carlos Lauría, the CPJ's senior program coordinator for the Americas, told The Washington Post that even when suspects are identified in journalist killings, the authorities rarely link the crimes back to cartels or their leaders. “The criminal justice system is incapable of providing any answers for journalists and their families who are being killed with impunity,” he said. “The collusion between the government and organized crime, yes, it’s a fact that it’s blocking the possibility of investigators ever getting to the bottom of these cases.” Citing the violence, the Mexican newspaper Norte in Ciudad Juárez announced last month that it was shutting down. “On this day, esteemed reader, I address you to report that I have made the decision to close this newspaper due to the fact that, among other things, there are neither the guarantees nor the security to exercise critical, counterbalance journalism,” wrote Norte’s owner, Oscar A. Cantú Murguía. In March, Norte journalist Miroslava Breach, 54, was fatally shot outside her home as she sat in her car with one of her three children. She had been reporting on killings assumed to be cartel-related, including attacks on police officers and gruesome beheadings. Breach was the third Mexican journalist slain in a month. The gunmen left a note near her body on a rolled-up piece of cardboard with a chilling reason for the crime: “being a tattletale.” In December 2015, The Washington Post's Dana Priest wrote about a call to a newspaper in Reynosa by an “enlace,” or a link to the cartels. The caller demanded that the newspaper retract a story about protection fees the city's mayor had paid to the cartel: The enlaces are part of the deeply institutionalized system of cartel censorship imposed on media outlets in northeastern Mexico abutting the border of Texas. How it works is an open secret in newsrooms here but not among readers. They are unaware of the life-and-death decisions editors make every day not to anger different local cartel commanders, each of whom has his own media philosophy. . . . Pervasive corruption abets the violence. Lauría told The Post that it's impossible for Mexicans to make an informed decision about their government or other issues if newspapers aren't protected and are afraid to print the truth. “It's a full-blown freedom of expression crisis,” he said. “It’s clearly affecting the health of the Mexican democracy. There are entire communities across Mexico where the people are not really aware of what’s going on.” Read more: A crooked cop’s execution-style killing in Texas exposes the ruthless inner workings of the Mexican Mafia Border agents beat an undocumented immigrant to death.

"Despite their notoriety as such, Mexico's drug cartels aren't really drug cartels. For one, they're too busy shooting and torturing each other to collude on the kind of price-fixing arrangement that would qualify them as a proper cartel. Nor do they deal exclusively in drugs. Over the years, many of the country's most feared criminal gangs have developed lucrative portfolios in human trafficking, kidnapping, oil bunkering and especially extortion. What's less known is that they're also big in the news business. In major border cities like Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa, the gangsters essentially edit the local news, which is to say, they censor it. Besieged residents of those places may witness a wild gun battle in broad daylight and see bodies splayed out in the streets, but when they pick up a newspaper the next day, they won't find a word about it. This was not achieved by a few threatening phone calls. Over the years, the gangsters murdered, kidnapped and ran off many of Mexico's best crime reporters. They attacked newspaper offices and television studios with bullets and grenades. And while the intimidation campaign has fallen hardest on local news reporters, gunmen have also attacked and killed correspondents from Mexico's major national media outlets. These efforts to silence and censor the news are a big reason that a new law in Sinaloa, one of Mexico's most violent states, has triggered a wave of outrage since its approval last week. State lawmakers voted for new restrictions that essentially limit reporters to covering crime and violence only after authorities have given their permission. Under the new law, reporters will be prohibited from taking pictures or filming at crime scenes, and must wait for official news releases until publishing or broadcasting their reports. It wasn't clear how the laws would be enforced and what would happen to journalists and broadcasters who don't wait for state officials to tell them what they can cover. ""Let's imagine someone has been chopped to pieces, and the press arrives and starts taking photos, and publishing them online and in the media -- all of that is offensive to the victim's family and others,"" said Sinaloa lawmaker Roque Chavez, telling local reporters that the measures would improve the integrity of the judicial process and protect the work of forensic teams. But Javier Valdez, the award-winning reporter and co-founder of the Sinaloa-based weekly Rio Doce, described the measures as a blatant attack on the press -- and one that reflects the thinking of a political class that would rather stop journalists from covering violence than stop the violence itself. ""They're more worried about the news coverage than reality,"" he said. ""Our reality is one of murder, corruption and complicity between authorities and organized crime, and they want to cover that up for the sake of tourism and investment."" Due to take effect Oct. 15, Sinaloa's new reporting restrictions have been condemned by press freedom organizations in Mexico and abroad. Mexico's National Human Rights Commissioner Raul Plascencia called it ""a bad precedent"" for freedom of speech. They are particularly galling for the Mexican journalists who have risked their lives to report on the country's criminal organizations, and who have been urging lawmakers to provide them with more protections -- not new obstacles. Mexico ranked seventh this year on the ""Global Impunity"" index of countries where killings against journalists go unpunished -- the worst rating in the hemisphere -- according to an annual survey by the Committee to Protect Journalists. After several dozen reporters staged a protest Monday in Culiacan, the state capital, Sinaloa governor Mario López Valdez said he would meet with them and that the new legislation had been poorly drafted. The backlash against Sinaloa's state legislators has been so intense that lawmakers said they will introduce a new proposal Aug. 21 to repeal the measures, blaming its approval on a busy agenda that didn't leave enough time for the fine print. But Riodoce's Valdez said he's still skeptical. ""We can't let our guard down,"" he said, speaking by phone from Sinaloa. Of course, not all Mexican reporters are noble crusaders for truth and justice. Some take money in exchange for favorable coverage, or no coverage at all. Carnage-crazed tabloids tend to outnumber serious news outlets. Yet Mexico remains a country with a fairly vibrant and mostly-free press, and one that has hung on through a dark and scary era when powerful forces from the underworld and the political world have wanted to gag it. There were times in Ciudad Juarez in 2010 and 2011, when the city was at its deadliest, that it wasn't unusual for 10, 12 or 15 people to be slain in a single day. You could follow the local crime reporters to homicide scenes all around the city and see the bodies in the streets where they fell. These reporters and photographers followed the police radio traffic and paid cops and others for tips, wanting to arrive first so they could get close-ups of the dead before the forensic teams got there and sealed off the area with tape. Showing up at homicide scenes too early carried its own risks, especially when the police hadn't arrived yet and it wasn't clear whether the killing was finished. Gunmen would sometimes circle back to finish off the wounded. Still, I never saw reporters get in the way or interfere with a crime scene. More importantly, I know that if they hadn't been there at all, there would be no way to know whether the deaths would be noted, documented and tallied, or if they'd be simply cleaned up and concealed, as if nothing ever happened, as some would have preferred."	207	"[{""start"": 277, ""end"": 516, ""text"": ""Over the years, many of the country's most feared criminal gangs have developed lucrative portfolios in human trafficking, kidnapping, oil bunkering and especially extortion.

Anabel Flores, a 27-year-old mother of two toddlers, was kidnapped by armed men who stormed her house in the early hours of Feb. 7 in the Mexican city of Orizaba, state of Veracruz. The facts are dramatic, but it’s also an old story: Flores was a reporter, and her fate was similar to that suffered by more than 100 journalists in the past 15 years. Her body was found two days later, on the evening of Feb. 9. Like many of her slain colleagues, Flores covered the crime beat. And in the state of Veracruz, one of the most violent in Mexico, fraught with violence by drug cartels, this is a high-risk job. Her death was another chilling reminder that a kidnapping almost surely means death for a Mexican journalist. It is a trend that Mexico shares with Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq and Syria, also among the world’s most dangerous places for journalists, where the murder of American reporters Jim Foley and Steve Sotloff at the hands of the Islamic State let the world know that a kidnapping is more likely to end in death than release. In Mexico, this has been the case in more than half of the 17 murders of journalists since 2014, as documented by the Journalists at Risk project supported by ICFJ and Freedom House. Nine of those 17 reporters, editors or news anchors were kidnapped before being killed. Their bodies were found after their abductions had been reported, and in all cases the authorities launched search operations. But the final, tragic outcomes prove that the government’s response, at both the local and national level, is woefully inadequate. Journalists have been missing for days before their bodies are found. When Flores was kidnapped, the Veracruz state government announced an operation to look for her. It didn’t work, and she was found dead two days later. The authorities can be even more clueless, as evidenced by the case of Moisés Sánchez, also in Veracruz. He was kidnapped in the town of Medellín on Jan. 2, 2015, and according to police reports, he was killed the same day. However, authorities took 22 days to find his body — even though they had several suspects in custody who had admitted the crime. Those are just the cases in which a homicide could be determined. In addition to those nine kidnappings that resulted in death in the past two years, two more journalists remain missing after being abducted. María del Rosario Fuentes, a blogger in the state of Tamaulipas, was last seen in October 2014. She was presumed dead after pictures of what appeared to be her body circulated in her social media accounts, but her remains have not been found. Mario Crespo Ayón disappeared in the state of Sinaloa in December 2014 and did not leave a trace. All told, 11 journalists who were kidnapped in Mexico in the past two years are either dead or still missing. Only five journalists kidnapped in the same period were lucky enough to be released. The problem of missing journalists is not new. The organization Article19 has documented 23 disappearances since 2003. “Mexico is the country with more missing journalists in the world. A disappearance represents a continuing crime and a sign of despair in the pursuit of justice,” says Dario Ramirez, Article19’s director in Mexico. In the past 10 years, the Mexican government has created a special prosecutor for crimes against journalists, passed special laws federalizing those crimes and set up protection mechanisms for journalists at risk or under threat, measures that were implemented as attacks against the media grew at the turn of the decade. Since then, government officials and legislators routinely promise to improve the guarantees for a free press. The result? The situation is worse. In 2005, the Mexican press was ranked “Partly Free” in an index by Freedom House that serves as a worldwide reference. In 2015, even after the creation of laws and institutions designed to “protect” the press, Mexico was ranked “Not Free.” Mexican journalists are now less safe than ever, and as they struggle to protect themselves and form support networks, the response from authorities amount to no more than window dressing. For example, the state where Flores’s body was found already knew it had a problem. If Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, Veracruz is the most dangerous part of Mexico. In the past five years, 15 journalists have been killed there, and seven of the 17 Mexican journalists killed since 2014 were either murdered in or working in Veracruz. Four were killed there, and three others were murdered outside Veracruz but did their work there, including Rubén Espinosa, who had fled for Mexico City, where he was killed last summer. Veracruz also accounts for three of the seven missing journalists since 2011. Other southern states are almost as bad, though, such as Oaxaca, where six journalists have been killed since 2014, and Guerrero, where threats and attacks are frequent but not always reported. This means that violence against the media has shifted: In the early part of the decade, the northern states were the riskier places for journalists, mostly due to the violence unleashed by organized crime. Since then, as violence went down in the north, it went up in the south. More alarming, it’s not just organized crime groups killing journalists in southern Mexico, as it was in the north. Attacks or arbitrary detentions of members of the media come from criminal groups, but also from government officials or security forces. The murder of Moisés Sánchez is a case in point: Investigations alleged that his kidnapping was ordered by the mayor of Medellín, the town where Sánchez edited a small magazine, because he didn’t like stories that appeared in La Unión, the magazine that Sánchez published. Officials in Veracruz say that the hit was carried out by criminals hired by the local police chief — a macabre form of “outsourcing” violence against journalists. For years, Mexican journalists have known that stories about corruption, crime or violence can trigger tragic repercussions from those affected: drug cartel bosses, government officials, police chiefs. Violence has been unleashed on the Mexican media in an unprecedented scale, especially at the local level. Reporters and editors in small or medium cities are the most affected, and protection is absent. Impunity in crimes against journalists is rampant and it is the cause of every new aggression: Anyone who today plans to attack a journalist or news organization can do it because the ones that did it before got away with it.

There was the freelance writer, slain at a carwash. Then, the columnist that was shot twice as he left a restaurant with his wife and son. And on March 23, a 54-year-old journalist and mother of three, Miroslava Breach, was fatally shot eight times outside her home while she was in her car with one of her children. A rolled-up piece of cardboard was left with a chilling reason for the crime: “being a tattletale.” Three Mexican journalists were killed last month in an “unprecedented” wave of violence against the press. The job of a journalist has become so dangerous in the nation that one Mexican newspaper owner has decided he is no longer willing to take on the risk. In a front-page letter published Sunday with the massive headline “Adios!” the owner of Norte, a newspaper in the Mexican border city of Juarez, announced it would be ending its print publication as a result of the ongoing violence against journalists, killings that often go unpunished. “On this day, esteemed reader, I address you to report that I have made the decision to close this newspaper due to the fact that, among other things, there are neither the guarantees nor the security to exercise critical, counterbalance journalism,” wrote Norte’s owner, Oscar A. Cantú Murguía. In an interview with The Washington Post, Cantú said he also planned to announce the closure of the digital version of the newspaper Monday in a meeting with the publication’s staff. Though the newspaper has faced mounting financial woes, the decision to end its operations came after the killing of Breach, a correspondent for national newspaper La Jornada and collaborator for Norte, a colleague Cantú said he was close with. “Everything in life has a beginning and an end, a price to pay,” Cantú said in the letter, which was also published online. “And if this is life, I am not prepared for any more of my collaborators to pay it, nor with my own person.” The tragic news of Breach’s death made Cantú angry, tired and “fed up,” he said. Over the course of its 27 years in publication, the newspaper’s reporters have been in “the line of fire” and have faced a number of risks as a result of their coverage, risks that are heightened because of the newspaper’s proximity to the border, Cantú said. But with the death of Breach, the realities of the profession have hit closer to home than ever before. “For me, a free press is a pillar of democracy,” Cantú said. “If I can no longer do the type of journalism that I want to do … I cannot accept it anymore. Enough.” Shutting down the print and digital operations will eliminate about 150 jobs, he said, adding that he hopes to help employees relocate to other publications or companies. The closure was a difficult decision, he said, but added, “I would rather they lose their jobs than lose their lives.” Cantú also attributed the decision to financial troubles that he blamed on authorities: “The arrogant refusal to pay debts contracted for the provision of services.” In Mexico, government advertising is a major source of revenue for many news outlets, including Norte. But Cantu said the financial concerns paled in comparison to the dangers. The risks are especially high for smaller, locally focused publications like Norte, Cantú said. Killings of journalists who work for national outlets like La Jornada, one of Mexico’s main daily newspapers, are relatively uncommon. In general, reporters in the country are often “treated as the evil of society,” in a similar way that Trump referred to journalists as the “enemy of the people,” Cantú said. “It is an act of protest,” Cantú said of the newspaper’s closure. “It is my way of protesting with silence.” Norte, which printed about 30,000 copies of its newspaper during the week, and 35,000 on the weekend, was one of five local newspapers in Juarez, a border town of 1.3 million people just south of El Paso At least 38 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 1992 for motives confirmed as related to their work, according the Committee to Protect Journalists, a media advocacy group based in New York. Fifty more journalists were slain during the same period for reasons that remain unclear. “Mexico is clearly going through a deep, full-blown freedom of expression crisis,” Carlos Lauria, senior program coordinator for the Americas at CPJ, told the Associated Press. “It’s affecting Mexicans, not only journalists, because the fact that a newspaper closes is depriving people of information that they need in order to take informed decisions.” Lauria said he had no evidence that the three killings of journalists last month were linked, but he called Breach’s death “very alarming” and part of a pattern of journalists being murdered with impunity in the country, told the Associated Press. Breach was a highly respected, veteran reporter who covered crime, politics and other issues, according to CPJ. Her death prompted scores of journalists and supporters of free speech to protest in Mexico City. On March 2, Cecilio Pineda Birto, a freelancer and the founder of La Voz de Tierra Caliente, was killed at a carwash in Ciudad Altamirano, in the state of Guerrero. On March 19, columnist Ricardo Monlui was shot twice near the city of Cordoba in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, a state plagued by warfare between rival criminal groups. At least 1,258 people were murdered in the state last year, according to news reports. On Wednesday, veteran journalist Armando Arrieta Granados, the editorial director of the daily Veracruz newspaper La Opinión, was shot and gravely wounded by four bullets as he returned to his home in the city of Poza Rica, according to CPJ. Arrieta, a 51-year-old journalist with more than two decades of experience, remained in serious condition in the hospital after the shooting, media reports said. In light of the news of Norte’s closure, many readers spoke out in solidarity with the owner’s decision, while some reporters lamented the loss of jobs and vital local journalism. Hérika Martinez, a reporter and photographer for Norte, tweeted Sunday, “today, a part of journalism in Juarez died.” One reader commented on the announcement on the newspaper’s website that local journalists “do not deserve to lose anyone else in this fight against those who only see our city, state and country as a bounty for their lust for wealth and power. “The memory of their struggle will not be erased,” the reader wrote. “Citizens will always be grateful for their valuable dedication to make this world a better place for our children.” More from Morning Mix: Woman miraculously claws her way out of raging mudslide, escapes certain death ‘I can’t take that place.’ An Arizona family struggles with a mother’s deportation. 5-year-old girl suspended from school for playing with ‘stick gun’ at recess	205	"[{""start"": 52, ""end"": 315, ""text"": ""Then, the columnist that was shot twice as he left a restaurant with his wife and son.

“Where I work, Culiacán, in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, it is dangerous to be alive.” That's what Mexican journalist Javier Valdez said not too long ago, in 2011, when he accepted an International Press Freedom award from the Committee to Protect Journalists. Not only did Valdez work in one of the world's most dangerous countries for reporters — he also did some of the most dangerous work, covering crime and corruption in one of Mexico's most violent states. “To do journalism is to walk on an invisible line drawn by the bad guys — who are in drug trafficking and in the government — in a field strewn with explosives,” he said at the time. “This is what most of the country is living through. One must protect oneself from everything and everyone, and there do not seem to be options or salvation, and often there is no one to turn to.” On Monday afternoon, he was fatally shot near the offices of the newspaper he founded, Riodoce. He is the fifth reporter killed this year in Mexico, and his death comes just one day after about 100 assailants attacked seven national and international journalists covering a security operation in the state of Guerrero. They were on the highway that leads to Iguala, where 43 students from a teacher training college vanished in 2014. Riodoce, which Valdez founded in 2003, focused almost exclusively on crime and corruption. The reporter was an expert on drug trafficking and organized crime, subjects he covered extensively in his books. It was a dangerous enterprise, and Valdez had come under attack before. In 2009, assailants hurled a grenade into the Riodoce newsroom. Valdez, who also worked as a correspondent for the national newspaper La Jornada, specialized in chronicling the human toll of the violence in Mexico. In a story from 2014, he described the pain of realizing that your child has been kidnapped: Raúl felt like his eyes were filling with shattered glass. The tears didn’t beg permission. They began to fall. They ran down his skin. One of his children had been kidnapped. The police said it was an abduction. But he knew instantly that they were going to call to ask for ransom. His cell phone rang. It rang to the tune of El palo verde. Its macabre sound during this tragedy made him feel ashamed. His sixteen-year old son. The middle child. He saw his wife bowled over, brought low, sat in an armchair with the pain of rushing salty tears drying her out.… He hit the green button on the Motorola and let out an imperceptible tremulous hello. Look you son of a bitch we have your kid. He pointed the phone at the boy so that he could let out the terrified cry of dad. He asked for money in exchange for letting him go and he explained where and how to drop it off.… He cried again. He begged him not to hurt his boy. He got the money together and he delivered it. He didn’t tell the police because he was afraid. They are one and the same his wife told him. It’s not worth telling them. He waited and waited and waited. He hadn’t had news of his son for two days. On the third day they found his dumped body. Covered in bruises and holes. Colorless. Wasted. Eyes half shut. He also documented the extraordinary violence rocking his home town, with children routinely killed. The violence, he reported, had become “banal,” so common that young people would gather at crime scenes to take pictures and post them to social media. “This is cheap, easy death, crouching at two paces, near at hand, behind the corner, death not for having or not having a connection to narcotrafficking, but for living in a region wracked with violence and impunity, where crime is a routine and fear is no longer a novelty,” he wrote in 2015. “Culiacán, where it is dangerous to be alive, where everything is the same, except that on the skin of this northern region, a few steps from the Pacific and at the edge of the abyss, there are more bloodstains, scars, and crosses on the side of the road.”	204	"[{""start"": 1, ""end"": 260, ""text"": ""e I work, Culiacán, in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, it is dangerous to be alive.” That's what Mexican journalist Javier Valdez said not too long ago, in 2011, when he accepted an International Press Freedom award from the Committee to Protect Journalists"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 262, ""end"": 463, ""text"": ""Not only did Valdez work in one of the world's most dangerous countries for reporters — he also did some of the most dangerous work, covering crime and corruption in one of Mexico's most violent state"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 466, ""end"": 646, ""text"": ""To do journalism is to walk on an invisible line drawn by the bad guys — who are in drug trafficking and in the government — in a field strewn with explosives,” he said at the tim"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 701, ""end"": 842, ""text"": ""One must protect oneself from everything and everyone, and there do not seem to be options or salvation, and often there is no one to turn t"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 845, ""end"": 1162, ""text"": ""On Monday afternoon, he was fatally shot near the offices of the newspaper he founded, Riodoce.

"For more than a year, Karla Silva typed out the news in a cramped storefront office for El Heraldo de Leon, a newspaper in the central Mexican town of Silao. The front door was always open, she said, so that passing residents could drop off tidbits of local interest. The city styled itself as a tourist destination, but the 24-year-old reporter’s stories sometimes explored darker themes. Last month, she quoted a local leader accusing the mayor of ignoring the plight of farmers and the crime wave in the area. She wrote about a video circulating of a rough police arrest and an “extreme abuse of authority.” At 5:30 p.m. Sept. 4, three young men walked into the office and faced Silva and a secretary. “They simply entered, one of them said my name, and when I looked up, he punched me in the face,” Silva recalled in a telephone interview. “After the first punch, I fell. And then he kicked me in the face, in the head, all over my body.” “He kept telling me to stop with my stories,” she said. News of the savage beating has spread widely in Mexico, a particularly dangerous country for reporters, as photos of Silva’s bloodied face circulated on the Internet. Suspicion immediately fell on the mayor, Enrique Benjamin Solis Arzola, who is from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI. He has denied involvement. Threats, intimidation and physical violence are common against reporters in Mexico. More than 50 journalists have been killed or have disappeared there since 2007, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, who condemned Silva’s beating. In dangerous cities, newspapers often go silent about violence, fearing retribution. Reporters for even the biggest national papers sometimes don’t use bylines when reporting from cartel-controlled areas. In the days since the attack, Silva’s colleagues have rallied around her. Earlier this week, about 100 journalists marched on the mayor’s office in Silao, shouting, “Karla is not alone"" and “We are all Karla,” and demanded his protection of the free press. But now that she's out of the hospital -- with swelling on the brain and blurred vision -- she said the attack may be enough to drive her from her profession. “I’m worried and scared,” she said. “As a journalist, I don’t know if I’m going to return to my job. Time will tell. I will do what is possible so that this doesn’t affect my work, but I haven’t decided.” “It’s very difficult what the journalists are confronting here every day,” she said. And as she told the Spanish newspaper, El Pais: “There is no worse enemy than a man who is afraid.” Gabriela Martinez contributed to this post."	203	"[{""start"": 390, ""end"": 997, ""text"": ""Last month, she quoted a local leader accusing the mayor of ignoring the plight of farmers and the crime wave in the area.

As the Mexico City bureau chief for the Dallas Morning News for almost two decades, Alfredo Corchado has been on the front lines of the journalistic struggle to document the brutal toll of drug violence across Mexico. That struggle is among the world’s deadliest, with more than 60 Mexican journalists killed or having disappeared over the past decade, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Mexico is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists,” according to Reporters Without Borders. “They are threatened and murdered by organized crime or corrupt officials with impunity. The resulting climate of fear leads to self-censorship and undermines freedom of information.” Stories about government corruption, Mexico’s middle-class exodus and drug violence have placed Corchado on the receiving end of numerous death threats that have forced him to flee the country for months at a time. Like many of his courageous Mexican contemporaries, he has attempted to forge ahead, even as entire regions of the embattled nation — Sinaloa, Tamaulipas and Durango — have had their independent media silenced by the specter of violence. In these places, Corchado notes, nobody prints anything without cartel approval, including — it would seem — Sean Penn. [Censor or die: The death of Mexican news in the age of drug cartels] For Corchado and many of his colleagues, therein lies the problem with the American actor’s controversial first-person account of meeting with the notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Corchado said the story — published Saturday by Rolling Stone and submitted for Guzmán’s approval before it was made public — is evidence of the inherent conflict between journalism and entertainment. “When you’re not really challenging the person and have agreed to submit the story for approval, it sounds more like a Hollywood entertainment,” Corchado, who was recently named the borderlands director of Arizona State’s Walter Cronkite’s School of Journalism, told The Washington Post. “It’s not on par with the sacrifice of many of my colleagues in Mexico and throughout the world who have lost their lives fighting censorship.” “Is he serving the public or is he aggrandizing himself?” he added, referring to Penn. It’s a question that has rippled across the journalism world, with the Rolling Stone story drawing as much criticism as it has undoubtedly drawn clicks. As The Post’s Dana Priest reported in December, newspaper readers in Mexico “are unaware of the life-and-death decisions editors make every day not to anger different local cartel commanders.” Hildebrando “Brando” Deandar Ayala — editor in chief of El Mañana, one of the oldest and largest newspapers in the region with a print circulation of 30,000 — told Priest that submitting to cartel censorship demands is a self-preservation tactic. “You do it or you die, and nobody wants to die,” he told The Post. “Auto censura — self-censorship — that’s our shield.” He added: “The readers hate us sometimes. But they don’t know the real risks we go through.” Priest’s report noted that “four El Mañana journalists have been killed in the past 10 years. Others survived assassination attempts, kidnappings, and grenade and machine-gun attacks on their offices. Deandar has been shot, kidnapped and had his home set on fire, he said.” The report added: The three largest U.S. newspapers nearby — the Brownsville Herald, the Monitor in McAllen, Tex., and the Laredo Morning Times — forbid their reporters from crossing to report because it’s too dangerous, according to the editors at the newspapers. To many observers, Penn’s sometimes playful prose revealed a troubling admiration for the man who “is one of the main players in the country’s bloody drug wars, which have claimed at least 100,000 lives over the last decade,” according to Quartz. “As you dive deeper into the meandering mess, it becomes clear that Penn holds some sort of Hollywood-inspired reverence for El Chapo,” Gawker’s Melissa Cronin writes in a post that catalogues the story’s worst lines. For others, Penn’s controversial account was reminiscent of the magazine’s 9,000-word debacle about a gang rape at the University of Virginia that never occurred. Jeet Heer, a senior editor for the New Republic, alluded to the fabricated account on Twitter, writing: “Rolling Stone sets standard journalist ethics aside to get story that will attract enormous attention. What could go wrong?” Others, such as Vice correspondent Danny Gold, called out journalists for their hypocrisy. He argued that Penn did what any other journalist desperate for the most sought-after scoop in the world would have done, according to CNN. “Never a fan of Penn’s journalism,” Gold wrote, “but me and every other journo would have compromised a whole lot more to get an interview with El Chapo. Anyone else who says otherwise is lying.” MSNBC’s Chris Hayes noted that ethical considerations have a way of becoming immaterial in the face of “enormous traffic.” Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, told The Post that he would let the media debate the ethics of Penn’s actions. Before making a judgement, however, he suggested that people consider the degree of self-censorship occurring in communities across Mexico. Journalists in Mexico, he noted, receive no protection from their government, which is often complicit in the risks they take to write about. Considering that meetings with high-level cartel members and the media are “highly unusual,” but not unheard of, he said the actor’s story should be judged by what it reveals. “Should journalists ever interview criminals?” Simon asked. “I would say sure.” “But if you as a journalist interview someone like El Chapo, you better deliver some valuable and important information, in my view,” he added. “In this particular instance, he had an assignment for a highly visible and important publication, and whether he delivered a story worthy of the risks he took, that’s something the editors have to decide and the media itself should be debating.” Noting how rare such an interview is, Corchado said he hopes some insight will come from giving the public any glimpse of the criminal mastermind. And yet, he’s still troubled by how the information was acquired. “Do I or other journalists wish we would have gotten the interview?” he added. “Of course, but I doubt that we would have been provided with the same protections of a Hollywood star. The interview also came with big strings attached, like final approval by Chapo of the article. That amounts to similar censorship that my Mexican colleagues face today. Except if they don’t comply, they may not live to tell about it.” This post, originally published on Jan. 10, has been updated.

CONTROLLING THE STORY: This is the fifth installment in an ongoing series examining the human cost of reporting the news around the world. REYNOSA, Mexico — As deadline descended on El Mañana’s newsroom and reporters rushed to file their stories, someone in the employ of a local drug cartel called with a demand from his crime boss. The caller was a journalist for another newspaper, known here as an enlace, or “link” to the cartel. The compromised journalist barked out the order: Publish an article saying the mayor in Matamoros had not paid the cartel $2 million a month in protection fees, as an El Mañana front-page story had alleged the day before. “They want us to say he’s not guilty,” the editor who took the call told his colleagues during the episode in late October. Knowing glances passed between them as a visiting Washington Post reporter looked on. They all knew that defiance carried a high price. The enlaces are part of the deeply institutionalized system of cartel censorship imposed on media outlets in northeastern Mexico abutting the border of Texas. How it works is an open secret in newsrooms here but not among readers. They are unaware of the life-and-death decisions editors make every day not to anger different local cartel commanders, each of whom has his own media philosophy. Submitting to cartel demands is the only way to survive, said Hildebrando “Brando” Deandar Ayala, 39, editor in chief of El Mañana, one of the oldest and largest newspapers in the region with a print circulation of 30,000. “You do it or you die, and nobody wants to die,” he said. “Auto censura — self-censorship — that’s our shield.” Readers get angry when they don’t get the news they need, he said. Resentment against El Mañana grew so strong two years ago that reporters took the logos off their cars and stopped carrying their identification on assignments. “The readers hate us sometimes,” Deandar said. “But they don’t know the real risks we go through.” Mexico has long been a deadly place for reporters. Some 88 journalists have been slain in the last two decades, according to Article 19, a worldwide advocacy group that promotes press freedom. With its endless drug wars, Mexico is one of the most dangerous places in a world that has seen a recent upswing in violence against journalists, with scores of reporters killed or jailed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab Spring countries, Central America and the former Soviet bloc. The risks have been especially high for El Mañana because its circulation area is bounded to the west by the birthplace of the Zetas criminal network in Nuevo Laredo and to the east by the Gulf crime syndicate’s home base in Matamoros. In February, the last time El Mañana defied a cartel’s censorship rules, an editor in its Matamoros bureau was dragged outside, stuffed in a van and beaten as his abductors drove around threatening him with death. “Next time, we’ll kill you!” one yelled before pushing him out of the vehicle. Four El Mañana journalists have been killed in the past 10 years. Others survived assassination attempts, kidnappings, and grenade and machine-gun attacks on their offices. Deandar has been shot, kidnapped and had his home set on fire, he said. The worst assaults began in 2004, when an editor in Nuevo Laredo was stabbed to death. Two years later, gunmen broke into the bureau there, detonated a grenade and sprayed machine gunfire, leaving one employee paralyzed. Afterward, bulletproof glass and electronic security keys were installed at its three offices, where the blinds are always drawn. In March 2010, when the Gulf cartel defeated the Zetas for control of Reynosa, it took revenge on three El Mañana reporters whom the Zetas had forced to watch one of its mass executions. The cartel called the three Reynosa reporters and told them, “ ‘either you come in or we’ll pick you up,’ ” an editor there at the time recalled. They surrendered to the cartel and were never heard from again. Their presumed slayings were never reported by El Mañana, editors said, because that’s what the Gulf commander demanded. The enlace passed word that the killings were a one-time message to the Zetas, not a tactic the cartel intended to repeat against the newspaper. Twice in 2012, gunmen from the Zetas shot up the offices of the Nuevo Laredo bureau. Not long after, El Mañana announced it would no longer print cartel news in its Nuevo Laredo edition. Articles about Nuevo Laredo crime sometimes appear in other editions, but without a byline or names in the story. North America’s ISIS The cartels’ tactics resemble those most Americans would associate with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The display of multiple beheaded corpses and bodies hanging from bridges are a regular occurrence. Hundreds of young people have disappeared. Mass graves are commonplace. The comparison with terrorist groups 7,300 miles away frustrates journalists here. They watch the endless international coverage of Middle East violence yet know that the terrorism just across the U.S. border is largely ignored by the American media. Mexico’s 2014 murder rate of 13 per 100,000 is twice as high as Afghanistan’s. “We have a war here, and we’re doing war reporting,” said Ildefonso “Poncho” Ortiz, a deeply sourced reporter for Breitbart News Network’s Cartel Chronicles, one of the only American outlets to track cartel maneuvers. “Sometimes AP [the Associated Press wire service] will pick up a story, but other than that, it never leaves the valley.” The three largest U.S. newspapers nearby — the Brownsville Herald, the Monitor in McAllen, Tex., and the Laredo Morning Times — forbid their reporters from crossing to report because it’s too dangerous, according to the editors at the newspapers. Pervasive corruption abets the violence. The local police forces have been disbanded and replaced by the army and federal police in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which includes Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa. A car bomb killed the Nuevo Laredo mayor one week after he was sworn in. The new Matamoros mayor survived an ambush in March. Cartels install surveillance cameras throughout their cities and employ lookouts with cellphones to keep watch. U.S. Border Patrol officers are regularly indicted for cooperating with organized crime. “Tamaulipas is a black hole when it comes to information,” said Aaron Nelsen, a reporter based in McAllen for the San Antonio Express-News. “It’s so hard to get anyone to talk about it,” even elected U.S. officials. A cartel media director El Mañana’s circulation area includes major U.S. border cities; its online editions are read as far north as San Antonio and Houston. It is a third-generation family enterprise, founded in 1924 as an anti-establishment voice. Over most of its 91 years, its formidable enemies were corrupt politicians and their hand-picked prosecutors. The newspaper now maintains a working relationship with the local governments, as evidenced by the government advertising it receives. Withholding state advertising dollars is a common and effective economic hammer used against media outlets whose investigations upset the status quo. “When it’s not the politicians against us, it’s the drug dealers,” said Heriberto Deandar, 78, who co-owns El Mañana with his brother, Brando’s father. “He who is not afraid has no courage.” Brando was raised in Reynosa but moved to McAllen in 2007 for safety reasons. He commutes to work. Asked why he doesn’t find a safer job, he said simply, “It’s in my blood. I cannot leave.” During a recent visit to the town, the eerie atmosphere was inescapable. Reynosa’s wide boulevards were nearly empty. Heavily armed soldiers patrolled in black masks to protect their identities from cartels resentful of the army’s two-year occupation. Military helicopters whooped periodically overhead, racing to shootouts or hunting suspects. At dusk, hundreds of cars streamed slowly across the international bridge to McAllen, where an increasing number of well-to-do Mexicans have moved their families to safety. The Metros faction of the Gulf cartel controls much of civic life and all contraband — drugs, sex slaves, immigrant smuggling, fuel, stolen vehicles — in or moving through Reynosa, said journalists and media experts here. Its commander, whose parents are from Reynosa, has a more liberal view of the media than his counterparts in the other two cities. He seems to care about his image, too, they said, as evidenced by the “narcobanners” that appeared on city bridges in November. “This is to make it clear that I am a narcotrafficker, not a terrorist like you’ve been saying in the media,” the cartel boss declared in one handwritten sheet-sized banner. “Investigate and check your facts. Crime has lessened since I took charge.” In Matamoros, though, the commander of the cartel’s Ciclones faction tolerates no coverage. In Nuevo Laredo, the Zetas have a commander of finance, assassinations, logistics, stolen vehicles and fuel, weapons, prostitution, immigrant smuggling — and media. The Zetas media director, a clean-cut, 30-something man described by one person who knows him as “a pretty friendly guy,” calls enlaces and beat reporters at El Mañana and other media outlets every day to tell them what stories the cartel wants published or censored. One day it’s a story critical of new government limits on imported cars; the next it’s a birthday party in the social pages featuring a cartel boss’s daughter. Sometimes the media director provides photos and video for an article. “It’s a common conversation every day,” one reporter said. Reporters have learned to consult him on nearly everything, one media expert said. Even a car crash isn’t a simple car crash. “You have to call somebody to make sure you can write about it,” one journalist said, because it might actually not be an accident but a purposeful vehicular homicide organized by the cartel. Critical coverage of local politicians is also forbidden. For his own security, the media director changes cellphones often, but his online avatar always stays the same: a rabbit. The three cartel commanders’ differing media philosophies force El Mañana to produce three distinctly different editions. “If you want to find out what’s happening in Nuevo Laredo or Matamoros, you read El Mañana de Reynosa,” Deandar said. For example, when Mexican troops captured the leader of the Matamoros faction in October, known as “Ciclón 7,” El Mañana did not print a word about it in its Matamoros edition. But in Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo, it was banner news. With Ciclón 7 gone, Deandar said, “we are waiting to see who is the next chief, so we’ll know the rules.” Mechanics of self-censorship After hearing the enlace’s demand to exonerate the allegedly corrupt mayor in Matamoros, the editor on duty rubbed his head trying to contain himself. “First they tell us what not to publish, now they are telling us what to publish!” he yelled before heading upstairs to his office. He dialed the editor in Matamoros who had passed the enlace’s message to Reynosa, put the phone on speaker mode and upped the volume so the whole room could hear. Enlaces pass instructions via phone calls, text messages, apps and in personal meetings. They often communicate cartel demands to crime reporters who show up at the scene of shootouts, blockades, car bombs and executions. Sometimes a cartel member will run into crime reporters at the scene. “They’ll say, ‘Get the hell out of here! We’ll kill you!’ And we have to go,” one reporter said. Three minutes into the conversation with the Matamoros editor, the senior editor began raising his voice about the enlace. “Give me his name and number!” he shouted. “And tell him you’re not going to take any more messages! No more! Tell him if you take any more messages, I’m going to fire you!” He hung up, waved around the piece of paper with the enlace’s name and phone number on it and then stood up. It was getting dark. Time to leave for a safer city. The front-page story that upset the cartel was a reprinted interview with the new mayor of Matamoros, Leticia Salazar, an anti-corruption crusader. The interview was conducted by the national Excelsior newspaper. In it, she accused her predecessor of paying the Gulf cartel more than $2 million a month in protection fees from public works funds and towing fees. El Mañana’s editors felt safe publishing the interview in all editions because it seemed like a political corruption story, not one about the cartel. The cartel demand that followed was to run an interview with the former mayor quoting him as saying he was innocent of the allegations. But the former mayor had not requested an interview. As he left the building, the duty editor said he planned to call the former mayor on the way home. Speeding through Reynosa’s back roads in the dark, he called the former mayor, who said he had not requested an interview and did not know the cartel had demanded one on his behalf. It was time for a decision. “If you want an interview, we can do it in our office or over the phone,” the editor said. If it’s in the office, “we will need a photo of the interview; if it’s over the phone, we’ll have to record it. Either way, we need to show it was real,” not something made up by the cartel. We won’t publish it right away, the editor added, so the cartel won’t think it can tell the newspaper what to print. The interview ran three days later, in all editions, including Matamoros, where it mattered most to the cartel. But there was no byline, not even in the Reynosa edition. Instead, it read simply, El Mañana/Staff. Social media steps up Several years ago, shopkeepers, doctors, lawyers, mechanics, local government workers and students began to fill the void in local news with social-media coverage. It took the cartels a while to understand what was happening on anonymous Twitter accounts and Facebook pages. Once they did, retribution followed. On Sept. 26, 2011, the decapitated body of a female blogger was left at the Christopher Columbus monument in Nuevo Laredo. Next to her corpse were two keyboards and a handwritten warning, signed “ZZZZ.” But social-media crime reporting has only grown in the four years since. It includes real-time maps of shootout locations, slayings and kidnappings as well as endless cellphone videos of crimes in progress. During the Post reporter’s visit in October, alerts and bulletins about news that went unreported by El Mañana were rife on social media: Oct 17, 2:39 p.m. @MichaelNike8: Near the exit to San Fernando, tires burning to distract the authorities Oct 21, 1:50 p.m. @SSPTAM: Avoid the area between Reynosa and Monterrey. Authorities are responding (to a situation) Nov. 3: @Codigo Rojo [Code Red]: Yesterday, federal agents captured 3 men and a female commander of Toro [the local cartel commander in Reynosa] and seized 3 new trucks and around 20 guns, including 5 or 6 guns covered in gold and diamonds; This photo shows what was taken out of just one of the trucks. Also trending on Twitter the same week was the one-year anniversary of the killing of @Miut3. @Miut3 was a prolific citizen crime reporter. She tweeted the location of shootouts, explosions, carjackings and the identities of disappeared people. On Oct. 15, 2014, her anonymous account was hacked. Soon afterward, she became unreachable. Her followers frantically refreshed their Twitter feeds trying to find her. The next morning, at 5:04 a.m., a tweet from her account appeared: “Friends and family, my real name is Maria Del Rosario Fuentes Rubio, I’m a doctor and today, my life has come to an end.” Minutes later, two photos appeared on her account. One showed Fuentes Rubio in distress. “Close your accounts, don’t risk your families the way I did,” her account read. “I ask you all for forgiveness.” The second photo showed what appeared to be her bloodied face and corpse on the ground. No one has been arrested. An opening In February, a few months after Fuentes Rubio was killed, the two factions of the Gulf cartel in northeastern Mexico went to war again. The chaos provided El Mañana with the kind of journalistic opening it hadn’t had in 15 years. With the cartel preoccupied, El Mañana became the newspaper it might otherwise be had circumstances been different. The entire newsroom deployed to cover the battles. Dramatic photos, detailed articles and screaming headlines won Mexico’s attention. Readers in Reynosa finally got the full story of what was happening around them: Day One: “Border in Shock,” “Shoot-Outs and Roadblocks . . . ” Day Two: “Border Under Siege: Marines Attacked, Three Armed Men Killed, Soldiers Wounded” “We were all excited in the newsroom,” said a longtime senior editor who shepherded the coverage. “It was an adrenaline rush.” “No other newspaper in the state” provided such detailed coverage. “They were all afraid,” he said, nodding toward Deandar. “We have a courageous boss.” This was such big news, Deandar said he thought at the time, that he wanted to share it even with readers in Matamoros despite the standing cartel news blackout there. To be cautious, there would be no bylines and no names of cartel members. The cartels would not approve, cautioned Enrique Juarez, his Matamoros editor. Just after midnight, the red printing press in Reynosa rolled out Day Three’s edition. “Nine Dead in Fighting: Third Day Siege in Urban Areas and Roads.” Delivery trucks dashed to their distribution hubs. By 3 a.m., El Mañana employees discovered that the truck carrying the newspapers for Matamoros had vanished. Deandar rallied a posse; they found the vehicle at noon in an abandoned field, still full of newspapers. He ordered the papers be delivered to Matamoros, where they hit the streets an hour later. Juarez, up in his second-floor office, got threatening phone calls right away. At 4 p.m., as deadline loomed, someone called from the lobby asking him to come down. He found a knife and braced himself. Armed men burst in. One picked up a big jug of water and threw it at him, causing him to drop the knife. “We’re going to break you!” one yelled, as they dragged him away. They stuffed him into a van, beat him about the head and back, and shoved him onto the pavement an hour or so later. Four frightened El Mañana employees in the Matamoros bureau resigned the next day. A story about Juarez’s abduction and a photo of him at his desk, with the assaulting water jug, ran on Day Four next to the headline, “30 Dead Already, Mayor Suffers Grenade Attack, US Consul Suspends Operations” It did not appear in the Matamoros edition. Juarez and his family left the city. He no longer works in Matamoros. He is still not right, he said in an interview. “I don’t feel safe. I look around when I go out.” He worries that the fighting cartel factions will team up again and come after him. “If I had the opportunity to leave . . . ” His voice trails off.

More than a month ago, a group of armed men forced television journalist Salvador Adame into a black SUV near a water purifying plant, local news outlets reported. The abductors then fled the area, in the southern part of the violent, gang-ridden Mexican state of Michoacán. Weeks later, authorities found charred human remains in a rural area known as “Barranca del Diablo,” or the “Devil’s Gorge.” Through DNA tests, authorities identified the body as Adame’s, Michoacán’s state prosecutor said Monday, making him the seventh journalist killed this year in Mexico, the deadliest country for journalists in 2017. Adame had worked as a journalist for two decades and was the founder and director of local television station 6TV, covering news and local politics in the Múgica municipality. He had been a “frequent critic of municipal officials,” the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported. Authorities have taken two suspects into custody in connection to the murder: Ignacio Rentería Andrade and Daniel Rubio Ruiz, known as “El Cabezas,” who referred to Adame as his cousin, Michoacán’s state prosecutor said in a statement. “El Cabezas” had an active arrest warrant against him for a different kidnapping in 2015. The leader of a local drug cartel allegedly ordered Adame’s death, prosecutors said, adding that the possible motive was due to “personal problems” between Adame and the gang boss, nicknamed “Chano Peña.” The cartel leader sent Adame insulting phone messages, according to the prosecutor’s statement. Experts pointed out that Mexican prosecutors have previously come under fire for ascribing vague motives such as “personal problems” to the killings of journalists. “There’s been a tendency by the authorities to disqualify either the victim’s work as a journalist, or focus on personal issues and such as the possible motive, even if there are clear signs that the victim’s work as a reporter was in fact the motive,” Jan-Albert Hootsen, CPJ correspondent in Mexico told the Guardian. Roberto Rock, a committee chairman under the Inter American Press Association said “given the total impunity we journalists have already reached a stage in which while we do not have certainty regarding the causes of the murder of a colleague we have common cause to demand justice and that this be investigated painstakingly so as to learn the real motives of the crime and that those responsible be brought to court.” Mexico’s human rights commission called on the state and federal authorities to “intensify investigations in a comprehensive and well documented way so that the motive, whatever it may be, corresponds to the evidence.” Of the seven journalists killed in Mexico this year, at least four have been killed in direct retaliation for their work, according to CPJ research. Since 1992, more than 90 journalists have been slain in Mexico. About 41 journalists have been killed in connection to their work; the motives in the other cases remain unclear. In May, prominent Mexican journalist and founder of the publication Ríodoce was fatally shot 12 times as he drove away from his newspaper’s offices in Culiacan, Sinaloa. In March, three Mexican journalists were killed in an “unprecedented” wave of violence against the press: A freelance writer was slain at a carwash, a columnist was shot twice as he left a restaurant with his family, and a reporter was shot outside her home while she was in her car with her child. A rolled-up piece of cardboard was left with the reason for the crime: “being a tattletale.” Most of these killings go unpunished, and critics say a pattern has emerged of journalists being murdered with impunity. Due to the numerous killings this spring a newspaper in the Mexican border city of Juarez announced it would be shutting down. In an interview with The Washington Post, the newspaper’s owner said he was “fed up” by the dangerous risks being faced regularly by his reporters and he “would rather they lose their jobs than lose their lives.” This was not the first time Adame had been in the news in connection to press freedom concerns. In April 2016, Adame told CPJ that state police officers briefly detained him and his wife, also a journalist, beating them while they were handcuffed in the back of a police vehicle. They had been covering a protest at a government building. “We cover social issues and sometimes annoy the authorities by doing so, but I have never had any problem with them,” Adame told CPJ at the time. He said he and his wife were filming the removal of women from the sit-in demonstration. He said he believed a government official ordered police to detain him and his wife. He said he was even considering leaving the state. Their coverage “may have angered someone,” Adame told CPJ, “but we were just doing our job.” More from Morning Mix: Detroit judge halts deportations of more than 1,400 Iraqi nationals nationwide Watch a giant humpback whale breach feet away from an 18-foot boat off N.J.

“If the Devil offers me an interview, I’d go down to hell to do it.” The phrase became famous among Mexican journalists when legendary editor Julio Scherer used it to explain his interview with Ismael Zambada, a.k.a. “El Mayo,” one of the leaders of the Sinaloa drug cartel. Scherer didn’t have to go quite that far to meet El Mayo, one of the most elusive cartel bosses in Mexico. In spring 2010, he traveled to an undisclosed location, probably in the state of Sinaloa or in neighboring Durango, to meet Zambada. Five years later, actor Sean Penn would travel a similar road, in the same area of the Western Sierra Madre, to meet and interview El Mayo’s far more famous (or infamous) associate, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Penn’s interview, published this past week in Rolling Stone the day after El Chapo was captured, caused an uproar in Mexico. That an American actor, along with Mexican TV star Kate del Castillo, were able to meet a fugitive Guzmán turned out to be humiliating to the Mexican government, which hadn’t managed to recapture him after he escaped from prison last year. In the United States, it sparked a debate on journalistic standards and ethics, but for Mexican journalists, the interview can be painful. For all its journalistic shortcomings — the fact that Penn gave Guzmán final approval over the story, his shallow questions and self-indulgent writing style — the story is an important document in the history of Mexico’s drug war. Although it says more about Penn than it does about El Chapo, and we have to get through 20 paragraphs of an irrelevant and self-centered personal journal before getting to the actual meeting, it still does tell us something about the drug lord. We have some glimpses of how he thinks, such as when he acknowledges that the narcotics trade will go on after he’s dead. And we see how how he thinks he can deceive the Mexican public, saying that he resorts to violence to defend himself but does not start trouble. From a man linked, directly or indirectly, to thousands of murders in Mexico, this is revealing. The interview is also important, in a cynical way, for what it never bothers to acknowledge: The way El Chapo and his criminal organization, and its rivals, have dealt with the press. Penn might have thought his life, or at least his private parts, were in danger as he traveled the rugged terrain of the Sierra Madre. Unlike virtually every journalist covering drug cartels in Mexico, he had almost nothing to worry about. Last fall, as the Mexican Navy’s special operations unit was hunting El Chapo in the Sierra Madre (and, though we didn’t know it at the time, after Penn had met Guzmán), I was asked by some colleagues about the security precautions they should take while trying to cover the story in the small towns where commandos had carried out raids. The terrain was difficult to cross, and transportation was mostly in trucks on dirt roads. But the real danger was the armed gangs that formed El Chapo’s protective cocoon. The risk of bumping into the wrong people was too great. However, journalists traveled down there and managed to report on the raids at a great personal risk. Did Penn run the same risk? Of course not. He was able to travel those roads protected by the very same people who made it dangerous for every other journalist to cover El Chapo’s hideouts. Penn was protected by the people who did not want other reporters nosing around. The fear of being targeted in a government raid that Penn mentioned in Rolling Stone also proved unfounded, after it was reported that Navy commandos held back their operations because the actors were still in the hot zone. Once he got to Guzmán’s hideout, Penn was treated to a feast of carne asada, tacos and tequila. He might not have known similar meals happen regularly in several Mexican cities when crime bosses want to meet with reporters. But these are not optional affairs — either the journalists attend willingly, or they’re taken at gunpoint. Once they’re there, reporters might find the same buffet that Penn shared with El Chapo. Something else is served besides tacos, though: a very specific threat about what journalists can and cannot publish or broadcast; a very thorough list of “do’s and don’ts” for reporters and editors who cover local crime; a very clear mention of the price to be paid if they fall out of line. Obviously, El Chapo would not subject a Hollywood movie star to such treatment, especially when he was seeking Penn and Del Castillo’s help to make a movie about himself. That just underscores how different Penn’s experience was from what actual journalists go through trying to cover the drug war in Mexico. In the last decade, at least 17 journalists have been killed or disappeared just in Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua and Sonora, the states where El Chapo was reported to have been hiding out since his first escape from prison in 2001, according to the International Center for Journalists and Freedom House. Many others who cover crime and drug trafficking have been kidnapped, beaten or threatened: Since 2000, dozens of Mexican journalists have been killed or made to vanish. It’s impossible to know which cases can be attributed to the Sinaloa cartel or to its rivals, but most of them are the direct or indirect product of a wave of violence and impunity unleashed by criminal bosses, including Penn’s chivalrous, flatulence-ignoring host El Chapo. I have seen some cases closely. In the summer of 2010, Sinaloa cartel henchmen kidnapped three of my colleagues who were covering a prison riot in Gómez Palacio, in Durango, where the drug trade is controlled by El Chapo’s group. The reporters were later released. One year later, unidentified people set a car on fire in the main entrance to the offices of El Siglo de Torreón, the newspaper where I was editorial director at the time. The attack came a day after we published a story about the arrest of an important Sinaloa cartel boss in the region. Did El Chapo personally order these attacks? Probably not. But when he sits at the top of the organization, he bears responsibility for them, because he knows the “benefits” of instilling self-censorship in the press very well. From Penn and Rolling Stone, Guzmán obtained the same discretion criminal bosses routinely impose on Mexican reporters and news outlets. The difference is that Penn and Rolling Stone granted it after a nice meal in the Sierra Madre and a series of polite messages, while journalists in Mexico usually face the barrel of a gun. There is a self-dramatizing tone of false heroics in Penn’s narrative. If he wants to know the real danger in covering the cartels, maybe he should get a job at any paper in Sinaloa or Durango and work the crime beat on a daily basis, along with dozens of brave reporters and editors. There may be fewer charter flights involved, and he might even have to learn to use a laptop. While he wouldn’t have to submit his final draft for murderers to review, he’d live every day with the fear that one of his stories might provoke the wrath of some cartel boss somewhere. And suddenly, he’d be just another statistic.	199	"[{""start"": 382, ""end"": 513, ""text"": ""In spring 2010, he traveled to an undisclosed location, probably in the state of Sinaloa or in neighboring Durango, to meet Zambada"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4682, ""end"": 4984, ""text"": ""n the last decade, at least 17 journalists have been killed or disappeared just in Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua and Sonora, the states where El Chapo was reported to have been hiding out since his first escape from prison in 2001, according to the International Center for Journalists and Freedom House"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5463, ""end"": 5695, ""text"": ""In the summer of 2010, Sinaloa cartel henchmen kidnapped three of my colleagues who were covering a prison riot in Gómez Palacio, in Durango, where the drug trade is controlled by El Chapo’s group.

MEXICO CITY — Javier Valdez, a veteran reporter who specialized in covering drug trafficking and organized crime, was slain Monday in the northern Mexico state of Sinaloa, the latest in a wave of journalist killings in one of the world’s most dangerous countries for media workers. Valdez is the fifth journalist to be killed in Mexico in just over two months and the second high-profile reporter to be slain in the country this decade. The first was Regina Martínez Pérez, who was killed in 2012. A Sinaloa state government official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and so spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Valdez was killed in the state capital, Culiacan, near the offices of the publication he founded, Ríodoce. Ríodoce confirmed Valdez’s killing on its Web page, saying he was driving about a block from its offices when he was intercepted by gunmen. Valdez was the author of the books “Narcoperiodismo” and “Los Morros del Narco,” the latter of which chronicled the lives of young people swept up in Mexico’s drug underworld. He was also a correspondent for the national newspaper La Jornada. According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, unknown attackers threw a grenade into the Ríodoce offices in 2009, days after it published an investigation on drug trafficking. No one was hurt. “Living in Sinaloa is a threat, and being a journalist is an additional threat,” Valdez said in a 2011 interview with the CPJ, according to the group’s website. “We learned how to live in times when bullets are flying around us.” Sinaloa is a trafficking hotbed and is home to the Sinaloa cartel, led by the notorious Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, who is in a New York prison awaiting trial on multiple charges. According to the CPJ, 40 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 1992 for reasons confirmed as related to their work. An additional 50 were slain during the same period under circumstances that have not been clarified.	198	"[{""start"": 14, ""end"": 281, ""text"": ""ier Valdez, a veteran reporter who specialized in covering drug trafficking and organized crime, was slain Monday in the northern Mexico state of Sinaloa, the latest in a wave of journalist killings in one of the world’s most dangerous countries for media workers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 282, ""end"": 435, ""text"": ""z is the fifth journalist to be killed in Mexico in just over two months and the second high-profile reporter to be slain in the country this decade"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 745, ""end"": 884, ""text"": ""Ríodoce confirmed Valdez’s killing on its Web page, saying he was driving about a block from its offices when he was intercepted by gunmen."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 437, ""end"": 496, ""text"": ""The first was Regina Martínez Pérez, who was killed in 2012"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1128, ""end"": 1322, ""text"": ""g to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, unknown attackers threw a grenade into the Ríodoce offices in 2009, days after it published an investigation on drug trafficking"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1342, ""end"": 1501, ""text"": ""Living in Sinaloa is a threat, and being a journalist is an additional threat,” Valdez said in a 2011 interview with the CPJ, according to the group’s website."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1571, ""end"": 1748, ""text"": ""loa is a trafficking hotbed and is home to the Sinaloa cartel, led by the notorious Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, who is in a New York prison awaiting trial on multiple charges"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1750, ""end"": 1973, ""text"": ""According to the CPJ, 40 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 1992 for reasons confirmed as related to their work.
