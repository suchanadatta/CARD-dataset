Not for the first time, NASA will postpone the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope by at least a year, to May 2020, the agency announced Tuesday. The delay may increase the cost of the mission — the bigger and more powerful successor to the Hubble Space Telescope — beyond the $8 billion funding cap established by law. If that happens, the JWST will need to be reapproved by Congress. It's yet another setback for the ambitious but beleaguered mission, which has been in the works since 1996. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said the delay is required to deal with issues that arose as the telescope components were brought together at the Redondo Beach, Calif., facility of Northrop Grumman, the project's main contractor. Tests of some of the spacecraft's main components, particularly the tennis-court-size sun shield, have taken longer than expected. In addition, “a few mistakes happened,” Zurbuchen said, prolonging the integration and testing phase. “Extensive testing is the only way to ensure the mission will succeed with high confidence,” Zurbuchen said. “Simply put, we have one shot to get this right before going into space.” The project's standing review board predicted with 70 percent confidence that, with further tests, the telescope will be ready to launch in May 2020. The massive space telescope, which has already cost $7.3 billion to develop, was a top priority in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine's 2000 Decadal Survey. Designed to work in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, the JWST's gold-covered, 20-foot-wide mirror would collect the oldest light in the universe, allowing scientists unprecedented insight into the time known as “cosmic dawn.” It would also probe the mysteries of black holes and seek out signs of life on planets orbiting distant suns. But much of the technology required for such a fantastic instrument didn't yet exist. The JWST's creators had to invent, among other things, a main mirror and a heat shield that could unfold like origami in orbit. The cost of the mission quickly ballooned past the initial projection of about $1 billion, and the launch was pushed back from 2007 to 2008, then 2009, then 2010, then 2011, then 2013, then 2014, then 2015 or maybe 2016. The journal Nature called the JWST “the telescope that ate astronomy.” After nearly canceling the mission in 2011, Congress voted to cap all additional funding for the project at $8 billion. A new plan put the telescope on target to launch in 2018. But that date has since slipped to 2019 and, today, to May 2020 at the earliest. Acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot said the exhaustive integration and testing process, which can feel excruciatingly slow at times, is needed to ensure that the JWST is functional when it arrives in orbit. Unlike Hubble, which was in low Earth orbit and could be repaired by astronauts when a flaw in its main mirror was revealed after launch, the JWST will be a million miles from Earth, four times as far as the moon. “It's this really important balance between pushing and being considerate and absolutely thoughtful about where we’re going,” Lightfoot said.  According to Dennis Andrucyk, deputy associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, the launch schedule took hits after mishaps required the replacement of a transducer that was incorrectly powered, valves that were affected when the wrong solvent was run through the propulsion system and a catalyst bed that was overheated. Engineers are also working to fix small tears in the sun shield and slack in the cables that help it unfold. Meanwhile, each unfolding and refolding of the sun shield has taken twice as long as expected, further delaying work. According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, Northrop Grumman staff are working three shifts, 24 hours a day, to handle the issues. Andrucyk said Tuesday that NASA will increase engineering oversight of these final phases, including ensuring that a senior official from the Goddard Space Flight Center (where the JWST was built) is always present at Northrop Grumman. In addition, an independent review board chaired by retired aerospace executive Tom Young will review the project's schedule, helping to establish a firmer timeline for launch. NASA expects to give a full report to Congress in late June. The delay will have ramifications beyond the JWST team. NASA will need to negotiate a new launch date with the European Space Agency, which runs the spaceport in French Guiana where the telescope is supposed to lift off. And astronomers who wish to use the telescope for research will now have until 2019 to submit proposals for experiments. The ongoing drama with the JWST may also affect the outlook for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, a dark-matter observatory that was the top priority of the 2010 Decadal Survey. NASA is already weighing cost-cutting measures for the mission, which was recently projected to cost 12 percent more than its budget. And in his most recent budget request, President Trump proposed scrapping the mission (for now, Congress has decided to keep funding it). But Zurbuchen said the two missions are different in design, if not in importance. “We’re not going to be in a situation where 10 miracles are required” technologically, as happened with the JWST, he said.  Still, he mulled whether the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine should wait for data from Webb before finalizing the next decadal survey, which will set priorities for the 2030s and beyond.

It hasn’t been the best month for the Hubble Space Telescope. During the first week of October, one of the spacecraft’s three gyroscopes failed. The giant telescope needs the devices to measure turning speeds and to zero in on the things in space it observes and photographs. In a statement, NASA reassured the public that the breakdown was expected, saying the gyro “had been exhibiting end-of-life behavior for approximately a year” and, in any case, “two other gyros of the same type had already failed.” To replace it, NASA engineers powered up a backup gyroscope that had been dormant since early 2011. They were heartened, at first. The gyroscope began spinning despite not being used for 7½ years. However, it sent back readings that were clearly too high. The discrepancy was “similar to a speedometer on your car continuously showing that your speed is 100 miles per hour faster than it actually is,” NASA said. “It properly shows when your car speeds up or slows down, and by how much, but the actual speed is inaccurate.” Engineers concluded the problem must have been some kind of mechanical obstruction. Vowing to fix it, NASA kept the telescope in “safe mode,” limiting its operations in the same way a computer in that mode operates at bare-bones settings. Keeping the telescope in safe mode also meant “we were not doing science,” Hubble Operations Project Manager Patrick Crouse told The Washington Post. Days passed. NASA teams ran tests, reviewed the flight software and considered what they could do to remedy the problem with as little damage as possible to their prized (and expensive) telescope. (Though the Hubble can operate with fewer gyroscopes, it normally uses three for maximum efficiency.) On Oct. 16, the Hubble team even attempted a “running restart,” turning the problematic gyroscope off for one second, then back on again. Unfortunately, the “have you tried powering it off and on?” approach — long favored as a first-resort by technical support staff on Earth — didn’t work in space. Would that it were that easy, Crouse said. Instead, what appeared to work was repeatedly turning the entire Hubble spacecraft to see if it would “dislodge” anything that was blocking the gyroscope in question. NASA explained the fix in more technical terms in a blog post Monday: The repeated maneuvers seemed to work, with the gyro reporting rotation rates that were back to normal — much to the relief of Hubble engineers, Crouse said. “We believed all along, or from very early on, that the gyro appeared to be useful and just had to make sure to get it back to a useful state,” he said. Crouse paused when asked to explain what had happened in layman’s terms. “At a high level, if people want to call it jiggling around, I suppose they can,” he said. “But we were trying to do very particular activities we thought would clear the problem. It certainly wasn’t as simple as turning it off and turning it back on.” Still, that didn’t stop a variety of news outlets from reporting that NASA had fixed its telescope “the way you fix your router.” “NASA fixes Hubble gyroscope by turning it off and on again,” Engadget stated Wednesday. “What fixed NASA’s Hubble space telescope? Someone flipped a switch on and off,” USA Today followed. Crouse said those headlines were “an oversimplification,” though he can understand the confusion over extremely technical matters. “It’s hard to keep everybody up to date on exactly the process,” he said. “I can understand that some people maybe took the easy way out. But to reflect where we are [with Hubble], we’re very optimistic. We’re not out of the woods yet, but we’re very optimistic we can get back to doing science again.” The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit in 1990, and ever since its first photo — an underwhelming grainy, black-and-white image of some stars, thanks to a flaw in a primary mirror — it has gone on to deliver some truly dazzling images from space. Time magazine has a roundup of the 50 “best” photos taken by Hubble, though all are quite extraordinary in their own way, depending on one’s interest in any particular corner of the universe. NASA has been developing a new telescope, the $8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, that will be able to see back in time, almost to the beginning of the universe. The Webb will be able to collect seven times the starlight as the Hubble and observe the universe in infrared wavelengths of light, which the Hubble can’t, The Washington Post’s Joel Achenbach reported in February. Eventually, the Webb telescope is expected to replace the Hubble, which “is still working fabulously but getting long in the tooth,” Achenbach wrote.

Operations on one of the Hubble Space Telescope’s most important instruments were suspended Tuesday as NASA investigates a hardware malfunction with the instrument. Tom Brown, the Hubble mission head at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said the glitch affects the optical and ultraviolet channels on Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3. This camera, which was installed during a 2009 servicing mission, has produced about 50 percent of all Hubble science results in the past decade and many of its most celebrated images. Engineers are working to find a solution to the problem, which could take days or even weeks, Brown said. But he was confident that the camera will soon be back up and working. Because NASA can no longer service the telescope, engineers built several redundancies into each instrument to ensure they keep functioning after a mishap. Brown did not expect the partial government shutdown to affect scientists' ability to address the problem. Though 95 percent of NASA employees are furloughed, those who operate currently flying missions like Hubble are exempt and currently working without pay. This is the second technical issue Hubble operators have faced in recent months. In October, a problem with one of the gyroscopes that keeps the telescope pointed in the proper direction brought operations to a halt for several weeks. The two glitches are unrelated, Brown said, but they’re emblematic of the same challenge. “Every one of these issues is a sign of age,” he said. Hubble is nearly 30 years old, and its orbit around Earth exposes it to an extreme space environment. NASA’s billion-dollar-a-year astrophysics program flies eight major telescopes aimed at studying space beyond the solar system. Of these, all but one are in their “extended missions” — the bonus years beyond the time for which the spacecraft was originally designed. NASA has one new flagship observatory in development, the James Webb Space Telescope, but engineering mishaps and cost overruns have put it significantly behind schedule. Hubble is expected to work well into the 2020s. Still, Matt Mountain, president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, which operates Hubble on behalf of NASA, told The Washington Post in October that he worries about what will happen when it and other observatories are gone. “We’re facing a very daunting prospect as a community,” Mountain said. “Some fields just won’t have a telescope. And the science will not be possible to do in any other way.” Read more: As NASA’s prized telescopes falter, astronomers fear losing their eyes in space	664	"[{""start"": 165, ""end"": 332, ""text"": ""Tom Brown, the Hubble mission head at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said the glitch affects the optical and ultraviolet channels on Hubble’s Wide Field Camera"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 0, ""end"": 163, ""text"": ""ions on one of the Hubble Space Telescope’s most important instruments were suspended Tuesday as NASA investigates a hardware malfunction with the instrumen"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1115, ""end"": 1195, ""text"": ""This is the second technical issue Hubble operators have faced in recent months."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1196, ""end"": 1348, ""text"": ""n October, a problem with one of the gyroscopes that keeps the telescope pointed in the proper direction brought operations to a halt for several weeks"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1441, ""end"": 1595, ""text"": ""Every one of these issues is a sign of age,” he said.

When Nancy Grace Roman requested permission to take a second algebra course in high school, a teacher demanded to know “what lady would take mathematics instead of Latin.” In college, a professor remarked that he often tried to dissuade women from majoring in physics. And after receiving a doctorate in astronomy, she concluded that a female professor in the field had little hope of obtaining tenure. Undeterred by the barriers to women in the sciences, Dr. Roman found a professional home at NASA. Even there, she recalled in an interview years later, she felt compelled to use the honorific “Dr.” “Otherwise,” she said, “I could not get past the secretaries.” After joining the fledgling space agency in 1959, Dr. Roman became the first chief of astronomy at NASA headquarters, a role that made her one of the agency’s first female executives. She remained in that position for nearly two decades before her retirement in 1979. Dr. Roman, who was celebrated as a trailblazer for female scientists and a driving force behind advances including the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, died Dec. 25 at a hospital in Germantown, Md. She was 93. A cousin, Laura Bates Verreau, confirmed the death but said she did not yet know the cause. Dr. Roman spent much of her career helping develop, fund and promote technology that would help scientists see more clearly beyond Earth’s atmosphere. “Astronomers had been wanting to get observations from above the atmosphere for a long time. Looking through the atmosphere is somewhat like looking through a piece of old, stained glass,” Dr. Roman told Voice of America in 2011. “The glass has defects in it, so the image is blurred from that.” NASA credited her with leading what it described as the agency’s “first successful astronomical mission,” the launch of Orbiting Solar Observatory-1 in 1962 to measure the electromagnetic radiation of the sun, among other things. She also coordinated among scientists and engineers for the successful launch of geodetic satellites, used for measuring and mapping Earth, and several orbiting astronomical observatories that offered an early glimpse of the discoveries that might be reaped by sending observational technology beyond the veil of the atmosphere. But she was perhaps most associated with the early legwork for the Hubble Space Telescope, the first major telescope to be sent into space for the purpose of gathering photographs of and data from the universe. Hubble is widely considered to have yielded the most significant astronomical observations since Galileo began using a telescope in the early 1600s. The design and launch of Hubble was fraught by scientific, financial and bureaucratic difficulties that Dr. Roman worked to resolve. Lobbying for early funding for Hubble, whose price tag reached $1.5 billion, she recalled arguing that every American, for the cost of one ticket to the movies, could be assured years of scientific discoveries. “During the 1960s and early 1970s there was no one at NASA who was more important in getting the first designs and concepts for Hubble funded and completed,” space historian Robert Zimmerman wrote in “The Universe in a Mirror,” an account of the creation of Hubble. “More importantly, it was [Dr. Roman] more than anyone who convinced the astronomical community to get behind space astronomy.” The telescope did not launch until 1990, more than a decade after Dr. Roman retired, but when it did, its photographs of the cosmos electrified the world. In 1994, when NASA announced the repair of a faulty mirror and other problems that had caused its early photographs to be blurry, Dr. Roman was in the audience, knitting. Edward J. Weiler, then Hubble’s chief scientist, surprised her by recognizing her publicly, according to Zimmerman’s account. “If Lyman Spitzer was the father of the Hubble Space Telescope,” Weiler said, referring to the noted astrophysicist, “then Nancy Roman was its mother.” Nancy Grace Roman was born in Nashville on May 16, 1925. Her father was a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Her mother was a former music teacher and a nature enthusiast who took her daughter outside at night to view the stars. Dr. Roman, who recalled founding an astronomy club at age 11, moved frequently for her father’s work before landing in Baltimore, where she graduated from high school. She received a bachelor’s degree from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania in 1946 and a PhD from the University of Chicago in 1949, both in astronomy. After early work at the University of Chicago and the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, she was hired by the Naval Research Laboratory in 1955, working in radio astronomy. NASA was formed three years later, with Dr. Roman among its earliest employees. She spent the final part of her career at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., where she oversaw the Astronomical Data Center. Her honors included the Women in Aerospace Lifetime Achievement Award and the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Award. She helped promote professional opportunities for women through the American Association of University Women and spoke frequently in schools to encourage children to take on the challenges of science. Dr. Roman resided in Chevy Chase, Md., at the time of her death and had no immediate survivors. In 2017, Lego released a set of figurines honoring four pioneering women of NASA: Sally Ride, the first American woman to travel in space; Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space; Margaret Hamilton, a computer programmer who created the software necessary for the Apollo missions; and Dr. Roman. “I am glad,” she once told Science magazine, “I ignored the many people who told me that I could not be an astronomer.” emily.langer@washpost.com	663	"[{""start"": 3498, ""end"": 3627, ""text"": ""In 1994, when NASA announced the repair of a faulty mirror and other problems that had caused its early photographs to be blurry,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	642	2023-04-17T14:53:03.629059Z	2023-04-17T14:53:03.629126Z	3.589
NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope was supposed to be a million miles from Earth by now, peering deep into the universe and back in time to when stars were first assembling into galaxies. But its launch is still years and billions of dollars away, and mission success depends on many delicate things going exactly right. The telescope unfortunately has some screws loose. And washers. And nuts. Technicians discovered that rogue screws fell off during a test this spring. This was among several forehead-smacking errors and design flaws that have put off until March 2021 the launch of the telescope, which has so far cost taxpayers about $7.4 billion and now has an estimated price tag of $9.7 billion. The travails of the Webb will be the focus of two days of testimony, starting Wednesday, before the House Science Committee. Among those appearing and certain to face difficult questions will be NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Wes Bush, the CEO of the primary contractor, Northrop Grumman. The Webb’s problems have rattled many powerful constituencies. NASA is embarrassed and dismayed by the human errors that have snarled its biggest robotic science project, which was identified by the astronomy community back in 2000 as its top priority. The U.S. aerospace industry, which is dealing with a wave of retirements, needs to prove to national leaders that it remains as competent as when it put people on the moon. The same companies that build civilian space telescopes also build spy satellites. Earlier this year, a classified Defense Department satellite code-named Zuma was lost after it failed to separate from a rocket booster. That satellite was built by Northrop Grumman. An independent review board report this summer declared that the Webb is potentially vulnerable to 344 different “single-point-failures” — an extraordinary number for any mission. That means if a single metal strut fails, or a single cable gets snagged, “we have a ten-billion-dollar paperweight sitting out there,” said astrophysicist Grant Tremblay of the ­Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, the Webb cannot be repaired in space. It will be placed more than four times farther from Earth than the moon. Many young scientists have been counting on the Webb for research essential to advancing their careers. But they also understand that it has to be done right. “We know once this thing goes into space, we can’t fix it,” said Victoria Scowcroft, an astrophysicist at the University of Bath in Britain. “We would much rather wait for a telescope in space that works than not have one.” NASA is reviewing its science programs, Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s top science official, told The Washington Post. “How prevalent are human errors?” Zurbuchen said. “How many more mistakes are there?” NASA officials have increased oversight of Northrop Grumman. About a dozen NASA employees are embedded full-time at the contractor’s Redondo Beach, Calif., facility and more NASA experts rotate through regularly. Thomas Young, a former NASA official who chaired the review board, is adamant that the project should go forward, but with greater care: “There’s got to be an all-out effort to try to find any additional embedded problems.” Northrop Grumman, one of the U.S. government’s largest contractors, has expressed confidence that it can present NASA with an operational telescope. “Mission success is the cornerstone of everything we do. Getting it right is the most important thing,” said Scott Willoughby, program manager for the Webb telescope at Northrop Grumman. “No, we don’t need a culture change. We need people to understand how hard it is. We need people to know that we’re going to get it right.” The Webb is designed to see the oldest light in the universe. It can also detect the atmospheres of planets beyond our own solar system and look for the chemical signatures of life, such as an abundance of oxygen. In doing this, the Webb will probe two of the most fundamental questions: Where did we come from? And are we alone? The telescope’s 6.5-meter-wide, segmented mirror needs to be kept cold so that it can observe infrared light. It needs to be kept in the shade by a sun shield, roughly the size of a tennis court, that must unfurl in space. Many of the Webb’s components had to be invented from scratch — the vast segmented main mirror, the origami-like sun shield, the cryocooler that keeps the ultrasensitive instruments just a few degrees above absolute zero, the array of thousands of microshutters, each thinner than the width of a human hair, that will open and close to allow light from targeted objects to reach the telescope’s sensors. The telescope will be shipped from California to French Guiana via the Panama Canal, and will launch from the European Spaceport atop an Ariane 5 rocket. The telescope and its instruments sailed through testing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and then at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, before being flown to Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach. That’s where the telescope will be mated with the sun shield and the subsystems that provide propulsion, electricity and other functions, and are collectively known as the spacecraft bus. In April, Northrop Grumman put the sun shield through a shake test, simulating vibrations twice as intense as expected during launch. When the test was over, technicians counted 20 screws loose out of 1,000 of them that are needed to batten down a thin material covering the sun shield. These screws, half the width of a dime, are designed to fit into a locking nut. But the end of the screws could potentially scratch or tear the sun shield covering. Somewhere in the process, technicians had decided to add a washer to keep the screws from protruding so far. They did not realize this could impede the locking function, and some screws came up a thread short. In another error, the wrong solvent was used in cleaning thrusters. And the wrong kind of wiring led to excessive voltage. Those three errors — the screws, the solvent, the wiring — set the project back 1½ years and about $600 million, the review board concluded. The Webb traces its origins to 1993, when a panel of astronomers proposed that NASA build an infrared space telescope with a mirror four meters (about 13 feet) in diameter, at an initial estimated price tag of $500 million. But then-NASA Administrator Dan Goldin pushed for something more audacious. “Why do you ask for such a modest thing? Why not go after six or seven meters?” Goldin said in a speech to astronomers in San Antonio in 1996. John Mather, a NASA senior scientist and champion of the Webb, said the telescope could have been made smaller and simpler, but that would have resulted in a less sensitive observatory. “It’s not just another thing a little bit better than Hubble. It is dramatically different,” said Mather. NASA settled on the 6.5 meters at an estimated price tag of $4 billion. The launch date slipped from 2007 to 2011, and then to 2013. “At every meeting the goal posts were shifting,” said planetary astronomer Heidi Hammel, who plans to use the Webb for her research. “You could see the costs weren’t being handled properly.” The telescope’s costs began to cut into funding for other NASA astronomy projects. An article in the journal Nature dubbed the Webb “the telescope that ate astronomy.” The Webb program has cost more than a half-billion dollars every year since 2011. In 2010 an independent review chaired by John Casani, a veteran project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said that “lack of effective oversight” by NASA “resulted in a project that was simply not executable.” The following summer, the House Appropriations Committee recommended canceling the mission entirely. “That’s when we had to take a cold hard look and ask ourselves, is this worth going to the mat for scientifically?” Hammel said. “And the answer is ‘yeah.’ It was worth it.” The Webb had powerful political support from then-Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.). The telescope survived its dark period and the launch date was set for 2018, then reset several times to the current 2021 goal. Congress must now reauthorize the Webb, which is on the verge of breaching an $8 billion cost cap imposed in 2011. The current estimate of $9.7 billion includes the future costs of operations and data analysis. So far, there is no sign that lawmakers could try to pull the plug on the telescope. “This is a mission at the very edge of what’s possible,” NASA’s Zurbuchen said. If the mission succeeds, it will be a triumph for NASA and the astronomy community. If it fails, it will be seen as a tragedy for science and for the many people who devoted much of their lives to this space observatory. And critics will say, plausibly, that this was a telescope too big to fail and too complicated to work. sarah.kaplan@washpost.com joel.achenbach@washpost.com	662	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 185, ""text"": ""SA’s James Webb Space Telescope was supposed to be a million miles from Earth by now, peering deep into the universe and back in time to when stars were first assembling into galaxies"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2169, ""end"": 2344, ""text"": ""It will be placed more than four times farther from Earth than the moon.

In a blow to NASA's science, its budget and its ego, the space agency will push back the launch of its James Webb Space Telescope until March 2021. The delay is the latest in embarrassing and expensive setbacks for the flagship space observatory, which has been billed as the high-powered successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. It comes at the recommendation of an independent review board that found the ambitious mission has been plagued by human errors, embedded problems and unrealistic expectations about the time and money required to build such a complex instrument. According to NASA associate administrator Stephen Jurczyk, this latest delay will add an additional $800 million to the space telescope's development cost, bringing the total sticker price to $9.66 billion. This exceeds a funding cap set by Congress in 2011, and NASA will have to ask for reauthorization in the next budget cycle. Despite these difficulties, Jurczyk said, “Webb is a top-priority mission with great national importance, and it's worth the wait.” Conceived in 1996 and originally slated to launch in the mid-2000s, JWST has been described as “the telescope that ate astronomy” thanks to constantly slipping launch targets and ballooning budgets. The project has already been delayed once this year, to deal with issues that arose as the telescope components were brought together at the Redondo Beach, Calif., facility of Northrop Grumman, the project's main contractor. Avoidable human mishaps have added 1.5 years and $600 million to the time and cost of development, the review board found. The wrong solvent was used to clean the propulsion system. A transducer was accidentally fried when it was incorrectly powered. And 70 improperly installed fasteners on the tennis-court-sized sun shield fell off during testing; as many as four of them may still be lost inside the spacecraft, officials said. “Training, discipline, high-quality procedures and assuring a failure-proof safety net is available are required to ensure human errors that occur in the future are minimized,” review board chair Tom Young, a former NASA official and aerospace executive, told reporters Wednesday. In total, the report lists 32 recommendations for addressing these problems and ensuring the telescope makes it to the launchpad by its new deadline. These include providing Northrop Grumman with additional support staff from NASA, designating a commission manager with systems engineering experience to oversee the remainder of the spacecraft's development, and conducting a thorough audit of the flight hardware drawings and procedures to uncover any problems that haven't yet been detected. Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said NASA agreed with the recommendations and many were already being implemented. Asked whether Northrop Grumman would be penalized for the problems at its facility, NASA said the delays are factored into biannual evaluations of the contractor's performance, which determine whether it will earn awards on top of the cost of the project. “Make no mistake, I’m not happy sitting here having to share this story,” Zurbuchen said. “But the point is we’re part of this team that has created this problem we’re in. Northrup is part of this, but we have oversight of this, so we take responsibility as well.” The James Webb, which has cost more than $7.3 billion to develop, was a top priority in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine's 2000 Decadal Survey. Designed to work in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, its gold-covered 20-foot-wide mirror will collect the oldest light in the universe, allowing scientists unprecedented insight into the time known as “cosmic dawn.” It will also probe the mysteries of black holes and seek out signs of life on planets orbiting distant stars. But much of the technology required for such a fantastic instrument didn't exist when the telescope was first conceived. The new report chides NASA's “excessive optimism” in estimating how much time and money it would take to build the telescope, noting that “JWST is among the most complicated scientific experiments ever attempted.” Seven major aspects of the mission have never been tried before — including the telescope's massive sun shield and honeycomb-like segmented mirror, the transport to and launch from a European Space Agency port in French Guiana, and the flight to and operation from a spot a million miles from Earth — far more distant than the Hubble Space Telescope. This last point is crucial. Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which underwent repairs while in orbit, JWST cannot be fixed after launch. The ongoing problems have NASA considering whether it may have bitten off more than it could chew with the telescope. “We want to take leaps, otherwise we’re not NASA,” Zurbuchen said. “But how big a bite should we take is really something we’re asking across the board and trying to learn how to do it the right way.” Read more: Launch of NASA’s new flagship space telescope is delayed — again NASA's new gold-covered telescope will put the Hubble to shame Ingredients for life discovered gushing out of Saturn’s moon	661	"[{""start"": 253, ""end"": 328, ""text"": ""has been billed as the high-powered successor to the Hubble Space Telescope"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3532, ""end"": 3875, ""text"": ""Designed to work in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, its gold-covered 20-foot-wide mirror will collect the oldest light in the universe, allowing scientists unprecedented insight into the time known as “cosmic dawn.” It will also probe the mysteries of black holes and seek out signs of life on planets orbiting distant stars"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	640	2023-04-17T13:02:08.793761Z	2023-04-17T13:02:08.793829Z	750.799
"As we age, so does the Hubble Telescope. The telescope, which NASA launched into space aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1990, is nearing the end of a long career, Post reporter Sarah Kaplan wrote this week, crippled by a gyroscope failure. Hubble has made more than a million observations and, by 2014, generated 800 gigabytes of data every month. The telescope may be one of the most successful, and most influential, astronomical instruments humans created. Which makes choosing a favorite Hubble observation a bit tricky. Astronomer and science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson, when asked this question in 2015, told the New York Times it was “like picking your favorite child.""

Each column is 6 trillion miles in length, where, at the densest points, new suns coalesce into being. Those swirls are the signposts of a star nursery. Hubble took the first image of the Pillars of Creation in 1995 and again in 2014. Of the images, Jennifer Wiseman, a Hubble scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, told Nature: “You see the columns of gas that signify a region where stars have recently formed and are still forming.

The Hubble Space Telescope turns 25 on Friday, but no one should call it old. It’s mature. It’s the great silverback of astronomy, grizzled from wear and tear and yet still powerful and utterly dominant in its field. The Hubble helped change our understanding of the age of the universe, the evolution of galaxies and the expansion of space itself. Along the way it has had the equivalent of knee and hip replacement surgery: Five times, astronauts on the space shuttle paid a visit to swap out old batteries and install new instruments, including, in 2009, the best camera the telescope has ever had. How deep into the cosmos can the Hubble see? Deeper than you, punk. “It’s fantastic. It’s better than ever. That’s not just hype, it’s the truth,” said Jennifer J. Wiseman, the senior project scientist for the Hubble at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “This is 1970s technology, and it is still, after 25 years, the most powerful scientific instrument in the world,” said astronomer Patrick McCarthy, who’s working on the Giant Magellan Telescope under construction in Chile. Hubble’s fate, however, is cloudy. The great telescope is essentially stranded in space. The Hubble was designed to be serviced by the space shuttle. But the space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011, and the Hubble hasn’t had a repair job since that 2009 mission. At some point, under the laws of entropy that dominate the cosmos, the Hubble will begin to deteriorate — for example, losing its navigational ability as its gyroscopic sensors fail one by one. “It’s kind of like predicting when’s the next time your car’s going to break down,” said Jim Jeletic, deputy project manager for the Hubble at NASA Goddard, who on a recent morning led a reporter and photographer on a tour of the telescope’s operations center in Greenbelt, Md. Electronics eventually go haywire in a space environment that is flush with radiation. As it orbits the Earth 15 times a day, the 44-foot-tall Hubble goes in and out of sunlight, expanding and contracting, and that puts stress on various systems. Micrometeorites ding the exterior. A Hubble antenna has a hole in it that looks as if someone hit it with a squirrel gun. The Hubble was conceived in the 1940s, designed in the 1970s and 1980s, and still has vintage hardware on board, including a 1980s-era computer that freezes up occasionally and has to be rebooted remotely. And then there’s gravity. The Hubble is orbiting the Earth about 340 miles above the surface, significantly higher than the International Space Station. There’s just a trace of atmosphere that high, but it’s enough to drag the Hubble a tiny bit and cause it to descend a little over a mile per year. NASA said this week that, based on current orbital projections, the Hubble is expected to reenter the atmosphere “around 2037.” The telescope has no means of propulsion. One option would be to send a robotic craft to dock with the Hubble and guide it to a fiery, but controlled, reentry into the Pacific Ocean. The charred remnants of the great telescope would sink to the bottom of the sea. Another option would be to boost the telescope to a higher, “parking” orbit where it would stay for centuries as a piece of space junk. “When the time comes, NASA will make a decision on the disposal plan. Until then, NASA will continue operating Hubble as long as the hardware lasts, enabling it to remain scientifically productive,” NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown said. A celebrity scope As Jeletic gave his tour at Goddard, the Hubble was pointed at a quasar — an extremely bright source of light at the core of a distant galaxy with a black hole at the center. That’s just one of Hubble’s many projects. Built with the assistance of the European Space Agency, the Hubble is a global resource. NASA gets more than 1,000 proposals a year from scientists around the world hoping to take advantage of the telescope’s unique capabilities. The resolution of the Hubble is akin to reading the date on a dime that is two miles away, says astrophysicist Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute. That wasn’t the case at first: The Hubble has a 2.4-meter diameter mirror with a notorious “spherical aberration” that blurred the telescope’s initial images. Astronomers could do plenty of science, but they couldn’t get the gorgeous pictures, because the stars weren’t points of light but rather looked like squashed spiders. Three years later, in 1993, astronauts fixed the problem. They installed a series of coin-size mirrors that corrected the light as it bounced through the telescope, plus a new camera with the optical corrections already built in. That inaugurated the new era in which Hubble dazzled the world with one spectacular image after another. The telescope became something of a celebrity. When lawmakers threatened to cancel a repair mission, school kids turned over their lunch money to help pay for it. “Hubble gave us beauty in a way that no other telescope had ever done,” said John Mather, the Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist at NASA Goddard who is the senior scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to be launched in late 2018. Astronomers a couple of decades ago said the universe is 10 billion to 20 billion years old. Thanks to the Hubble and other telescopes, they can now say it’s 13.8 billion years old. The Hubble played a key role in the stunning discovery, announced in 1998, that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Astronomers detected this acceleration, which they attribute to a mysterious force they call “dark energy,” in part by using the Hubble to study supernovas in extremely distant galaxies. A long, hard look at the past The deep gaze of the Hubble offers a view into the remote past; all telescopes are time machines of sorts, gathering light emitted long ago. The Hubble, thanks to new instruments, can see deeper into space than anyone had anticipated when the telescope was designed, said astronomer John Grunsfeld, NASA’s top official for science, who as an astronaut visited and repaired the Hubble three times. “Before Hubble, we didn’t know how many galaxies there are in the universe,” Grunsfeld said. The orthodoxy was that there were tens of billions of galaxies. Now, thanks to the Hubble, scientists can say there are roughly 200 billion. That estimate stems from Hubble’s “deep field” images, obtained by training the Hubble on a single point of seemingly empty, dark space, and holding it there for a couple of weeks, collecting the thin stream of photons (particles of light) coming from the farthest regions of the universe. The Hubble might get just one photon per minute from the faintest objects. Some astronomers assumed that, looking far back in time, they wouldn’t see much. “When the Hubble Deep Field pictures were taken, people didn’t expect to see anything. It had thousands and thousands of galaxies in it. We were so far off it was incredible,” said Goddard’s Mather. “That’s one of the pleasures of astronomy,” Mather said. “It’s an observational science, and it’s a surprise science.” Wiseman points out that those early galaxies looked different from the ones we see today. They were small, fragmentary, and made of hydrogen and not much else. Closer to us in space and time we see larger galaxies, including the majestic spiral galaxies akin to our own Milky Way galaxy, which have heavier elements that include carbon and oxygen — the stuff of life as we know it. This cosmic narrative is written in ancient light, and it is ready to be decoded and appreciated by any species that can figure out how to build the right instruments. Jeletic thinks that the Hubble can keep doing good science at least until 2020. That might mean the Hubble would overlap for a couple of years with the operations of the Webb telescope. Five of Hubble’s six gyros, the navigation sensors, still work. The sixth failed last year, but the Hubble can navigate with only three gyros, Jeletic said. In fact, he said, NASA engineers think they might be able to find scientific uses for the Hubble even with only one gyro, or no gyros. It might not be able to point accurately anymore, but there’s something interesting anywhere you look.	659	"[{""start"": 1082, ""end"": 1343, ""text"": ""Hubble’s fate, however, is cloudy.

One of NASA’s crowning glories, the Hubble Space Telescope, marks its 25th anniversary this week. With 1 million-plus observations, including those of some of the farthest and oldest galaxies ever glimpsed by humanity, no man-made satellite has touched as many minds or hearts as Hubble. NASA is celebrating Friday’s anniversary with ceremonies this week at the Smithsonian Institution and Newseum in Washington. “Hubble has become part of our culture — very much,” said NASA’s science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who flew on the final three Hubble repair missions. Let’s look at Hubble’s quarter-century in orbit about 350 miles above Earth: A blurry start A decade in the making, Hubble rocketed into orbit April 24, 1990, aboard space shuttle Discovery. NASA wanted an observatory free of the atmosphere’s distortion and, in some cases, absorption of light. Stars, for example, do not appear to twinkle when seen from space. The telescope was named for American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who in the 1920s determined that the universe is expanding. Sky-high excitement turned into bottomless agony when it quickly became apparent that the telescope’s primary mirror had been botched during manufacturing, resulting in blurry eyesight. Three years later, with NASA’s reputation and entire future on the line, a team of astronauts managed to restore Hubble’s promised vision with replacement parts. Overhauls and tune-ups Shuttle astronauts visited Hubble five times, from 1993 to 2009, to make improvements and repairs to the 43-foot-long observatory, about the size of a school bus. That last mission almost didn’t happen: NASA canceled it for safety reasons in the wake of the 2003 shuttle Columbia disaster. But public uproar and changing NASA administration, along with detailed crew-rescue plans just in case, led to the flight’s reinstatement. By the time Atlantis blasted off on the last servicing mission, NASA estimated the investment in Hubble at $10 billion. Three-time Hubble mechanic Grunsfeld was the last person to lay hands on the orbiting observatory. He recalls giving Hubble “a little pat and a salute,” and telling it, “Good travels, Hubble.” Impressive stats Hubble has traveled 3.4 billion miles, circling Earth nearly 137,000 times and making more than 1.2 million observations of more than 38,000 celestial objects, according to the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. The most distant objects spotted by Hubble — primitive galaxies — are some 13 billion light-years away and date to within 400 million or so years of the universe’s origin, known as the Big Bang. Hubble provides an average of 829 gigabytes of archival data every month, according to the institute. Altogether, Hubble has produced more than 100 terabytes of data. Discoveries Early on, Hubble proved the existence of super-massive black holes — and found they’re located at the center of most galaxies. It also helped to pinpoint the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years old, by determining the current rate of expansion of the universe with an uncertainty of just 3 percent, according to the Mario Livio, an astrophysicist at the space telescope institute. Thanks to Hubble, he noted this week, astronomers now know that cosmic expansion is accelerating because of mysterious dark energy. The space telescope has shown that the birth rate of stars hit a peak in the universe about 10 billion years ago and has been declining ever since, Livio said. Astronomers have published 12,800 scientific papers based on data from Hubble. Some of the research on supernovas, or exploding stars, contributed to a Nobel Prize in physics in 2011. Future NASA’s Grunsfeld said “there’s pretty high probability” that Hubble will keep working until at least 2020. Gravity is slowly lowering the telescope’s approximately 350-mile-high orbit, but the good news is that low solar activity is keeping the atmosphere thinner, which in turn should keep Hubble up until the 2030s. On the last Hubble mission in 2009, Grunsfeld installed a docking adaptor on the bottom of the telescope. The plan was — and still is — to one day launch an unmanned rocket to Hubble so a motor can be installed to guide the telescope toward a Pacific reentry. The eight-foot primary mirror is the main concern: It’s expected to survive the atmospheric plunge. That’s why NASA does not want Hubble coming down, uncontrolled, over populated areas. Successor NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is due to be launched in 2018 to a vantage point 1 million miles away. The Webb will specialize in the infrared wavelength, allowing it to peer into some of the faintest, most distant recesses of the universe. This should enable the telescope — named after the late NASA administrator who guided the Mercury and Gemini programs — to look back even further in time than Hubble and detect galaxies formed a mere 200 million years after the Big Bang. By 2019, Webb should be up and running with the Hubble still in action and powerful, new ground telescopes pointing skyward. “It will just be absolutely the most capability we will have ever had to look at the cosmos and try and understand it,” Grunsfeld said. “I’m convinced there are going to be some big discoveries.” — Associated Press	658	"[{""start"": 3778, ""end"": 3855, ""text"": ""Gravity is slowly lowering the telescope’s approximately 350-mile-high orbit,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4550, ""end"": 4926, ""text"": ""The Webb will specialize in the infrared wavelength, allowing it to peer into some of the faintest, most distant recesses of the universe.

In the dim, red light of an alien sun, scientists have found the first evidence for water in the atmosphere of a “super-Earth”-size planet — offering a tantalizing (if cryptic) new target in the search for life in the universe. The intriguing world, which goes by the impersonal designation K2-18b, lies just 110 light-years away in the constellation Leo. More important: It sits in its star’s “habitable zone,” where it is bathed in the same amount of energy from its star as Earth gets from the sun. Twice as large as our own planet and eight times as massive, K2-18b possesses powerful gravity that would make it difficult to walk upon. It orbits close to a red dwarf star, much smaller and cooler than our sun. And aside from water vapor, its atmosphere contains mostly hydrogen gas — a molecule that makes up less than 1 part per million of our own atmosphere. It is no “second Earth,” said astronomer Angelos Tsiaras, the lead author of a study on the planet published Wednesday in the journal Nature Astronomy. But he believes it is “the best candidate for habitability that we know right now.” The paper by Tsiaras draws on publicly available data produced by Björn Benneke, a planetary astronomer at the University of Montreal in Canada. On Tuesday, Benneke’s team posted its own analysis of K2-18b on the preprint server arXiv, which hosts academic papers not yet published in peer-reviewed journals. Benneke and his colleagues also found signatures of water vapor in K2-18b’s skies. But they were less optimistic than Tsiaras about the potential habitability of this world. The Montreal-based team’s interpretation of its data suggests the hydrogen atmosphere forms a thick, gaseous envelope around the planet. This would generate intense pressures at the planet’s surface — perhaps enough to push hydrogen into a liquid form. “It is not a true Earth analogue,” the researchers report. Laura Kreidberg, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said that K2-18b might be better described as a “mini-Neptune” than a super-Earth. Extensive research with computer models suggests that, at 1.6 to 1.8 times the mass of Earth, planets tend to become huge and gaseous, rather than rocky. Though K2-18b is probably solid at its core, the temperatures and pressures at the “surface” would be so high that few complex molecules would survive, let alone any life-forms. “I think the result is amazing,” Kreidberg said. “It’s definitely the smallest and coolest planet that we’ve had a glimpse into the atmosphere of so far. ... But I don’t think it’s potentially habitable.” Scientists have previously detected water only in the atmospheres of “gas giants” — huge exoplanets that lack solid surfaces, much like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. But rocky exoplanets are smaller, making them harder to find and more difficult to study. Even a super-Earth like K2-18b can be examined only with humanity’s most sensitive space telescope — the Hubble. When K2-18b was discovered in 2015, Tsiaras and his colleagues thought it would be a good candidate for a form of analysis called transit spectroscopy, which involves studying the changes in a star’s light as a planet “transits,” or passes in front of it. The planet is so close to its cool host star that it takes just 33 days to orbit. So month after month, the researchers waited with Hubble to capture the moment of transit. As the starlight filtered through the planet’s atmosphere, some of it would be absorbed by the gases in the planet’s air. By separating the light into its component parts, the scientists could look for signatures of particular molecules. What they found suggests that the composition of K2-18b’s atmosphere could range from 0.1 percent water vapor (about the proportion in Earth’s upper atmosphere) to a whopping 50 percent. (At its highest, water vapor concentration in Earth’s lower atmosphere is about 4 percent.) Hubble isn’t sensitive to the right types of light to detect other important molecules, such as nitrogen or methane, so the researchers can only speculate about the precise composition of the atmosphere. The planet could have thick clouds, like Venus, that would heat its surface to an intolerable degree. Or its atmosphere might not be substantial enough to offer protection from the perils of space. Researchers must wait for more sophisticated tools, such as the long-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, to reveal more details about the distant world. Yet Giovanna Tinetti, a colleague of Tsiaras at University College London and a co-author of the Nature study, suggested it’s still possible there is liquid water somewhere below the atmosphere. “We’re going to need more observations,” she said. “We need to know much more about the planet.” Read more: So long, Kepler, and thanks for all the planets Found: Another star system with eight planets, just like ours There’s a new planet in the neighborhood — and it looks like a nice place to live	656	"[{""start"": 3925, ""end"": 4128, ""text"": ""Hubble isn’t sensitive to the right types of light to detect other important molecules, such as nitrogen or methane, so the researchers can only speculate about the precise composition of the atmosphere."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4327, ""end"": 4479, ""text"": ""Researchers must wait for more sophisticated tools, such as the long-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, to reveal more details about the distant world."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	635	2023-04-17T12:03:37.306525Z	2023-04-17T12:03:37.306595Z	257.835
"The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit on April 24, 1990 – nearly 26 years ago. Ever since, it has been supplying scientists with gorgeous images of the cosmos. The image above, which shows a star ""blowing a bubble,"" is NASA's choice to commemorate the telescope's latest birthday. The Bubble Nebula (NGC 7635) lies 7,100 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. It's a staggering seven light-years across, formed by a star 20 times as massive as our sun — that bright purple dot just left of center. Previous Hubble images have captured only pieces of the brilliant, ever-growing gas orb, but this latest shot stitches together multiple frames to show the nebula in its entirety. NGC 7635 is an emission nebula. The bright star at its not-quite-center throws off hot gases, known as stellar wind, that move at 4 million mph. When these hot gases slam into the cold gas and dust of interstellar space, they form an intriguingly symmetrical bubble. The star's intense ultraviolet radiation causes the gases to glow, with different elements heating to different temperatures to form distinct colors: Oxygen is hot enough to burn blue, while hydrogen and nitrogen form a cooler yellow light. More than a quarter-century into its tenure, the Hubble is still going strong. But its successor will hit the scene soon. The James Webb Telescope, which is set to launch in 2018, will be able to look much deeper into space — and, therefore, earlier into cosmic history — than the Hubble can.

Amid plenty of political turmoil on Earth on Thursday, NASA and the European Space Agency quietly released the latest photo of Jupiter taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. This picture revealed no new discoveries, unlike a Hubble image last fall that detected evidence of water vapor plumes from one of Jupiter's moons. Nor did it capture the aftermath of some significant event, such as when a comet or asteroid collided with Jupiter's atmosphere and left it “bruised.” Instead, Thursday's picture was simply a reminder that, somewhere out there above the heavens, a decades-old space telescope is still doing what it has done best: capturing spectacularly detailed images of the universe to blow the minds of those on Earth. This month, Jupiter is in opposition, meaning it is at its closest to our planet (416 million miles away), with its Earth-facing hemisphere fully illuminated by the sun. It will shine especially brightly Friday night and early Saturday morning, when it makes its absolute closest approach. Never ones to miss an opportunity, NASA and the ESA decided to point the Hubble toward Jupiter while it was in opposition, so that it could capture the atmosphere of the largest planet in the solar system in more detail. The image it took Monday didn't disappoint. Hubble was able to capture surface features that are just 80 miles across. “The final image shows a sharp view of Jupiter and reveals a wealth of features in its dense atmosphere,” NASA and the ESA, which cooperate on the Hubble project, said in a statement. The picture “reveals the intricate, detailed beauty of Jupiter’s clouds as arranged into bands of different latitudes.” Clearly visible in the photo are Jupiter's famous atmospheric bands, created by different-colored clouds. The lighter bands have higher concentrations of frozen ammonia in them, compared with the darker ones, the agencies said. On the lower left side of the image is Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot, an ongoing larger-than-Earth storm on the gas giant planet's surface. A smaller storm, dubbed “Red Spot Junior,” is visible farther south. Winds on the planet can reach up to 400 mph. “However, as with the last images of Jupiter taken by Hubble and telescopes on the ground, this new image confirms that the huge storm that has raged on Jupiter’s surface for at least 150 years continues to shrink,” the agencies said. “The reason for this is still unknown. So Hubble will continue to observe Jupiter in the hope that scientists will solve this stormy riddle.” The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit in 1990, and ever since its first photo — an underwhelming grainy, black-and-white image of some stars, thanks to a flaw in a primary mirror — it has gone on to deliver some truly dazzling images from space. Time magazine has a roundup of the 50 “best” photos taken by Hubble, though all are quite extraordinary in their own way, depending on one's interest in any particular corner of the universe. NASA has been developing a new telescope, the $8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, that will be able to see back in time, almost to the beginning of the universe. The Webb will be able to collect seven times the starlight as the Hubble and observe the universe in infrared wavelengths of light, which the Hubble can't, The Washington Post's Joel Achenbach reported in February. Eventually, the Webb telescope is expected to replace the Hubble, which “is still working fabulously but getting long in the tooth,” Achenbach wrote. Until then, the Hubble will continue capturing away. The photo released Thursday was part of the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy program, according to NASA and the ESA. The program, which allows the telescope to study the outer planets each year, started in 2014 with Uranus and has been observing Jupiter and Neptune since 2015. In 2018, the Hubble will turn its focus to Saturn.

In a cavernous, dust-free workroom at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, engineers and technicians are putting the finishing touches on one of the most ambitious telescopes ever built. When it’s launched in 2018, the James Webb Space Telescope will enable scientists to peer into the oldest, farthest reaches of the universe and search for signs of life on distant planets. “We want to see the first stars and understand how stars, galaxies and planetary systems are formed,” John Durning, deputy project manager for the Webb, said at Goddard recently while technicians worked inside the center’s 10-story “clean room.” “We don’t understand how we got here,” he added, “and we need to go to the beginning to figure that out.” Scientists theorize that the universe began with what is known as the big bang about 13.8 billion years ago and that the first stars formed 400 million years later. To see those stars, the Webb will use special instruments to study an invisible form of light that is given off by all objects, especially hot ones. Looking at that infrared light will allow the unmanned telescope to pull back the curtains of the universe and see stars too distant even for the Hubble, the Webb’s powerful predecessor. The $8.7 billion Webb project, named for a NASA administrator who helped launch the Apollo moon program in the 1960s, began 20 years ago as a collaboration between NASA and the European and Canadian space agencies. The telescope is designed to work for at least five years and has enough fuel to operate for a decade. Central to its design is a set of 18 gold-coated mirrors that are sensitive enough to reflect the light of a single match struck on the moon. The light is analyzed and recorded by instruments that are protected from the sun’s rays by an umbrella as large as a tennis court. Known as a sun shield, the paper-thin layer of plastic keeps the instruments as cool as 400 degrees below zero. “In terms of sunscreen,” Durning said, “the shield has an SPF of about 1 million.” And just like an umbrella or a Transformer robot, the sun shield — and the rest of the telescope — folds up, allowing the 15,000-pound Webb to fit snugly inside a rocket. Once the Webb is launched, it will take about two weeks for the telescope to unfurl and another two weeks for it to begin orbiting the sun — at a point in space that is a million miles from Earth. By comparison, the Hubble is orbiting about 340 miles from Earth. The Webb still needs to undergo final tests and additions. It will be flown to Houston, Texas, in March and eventually shipped to South America for launch from French Guiana. Technician Marc Sansebastian will be there to make sure nothing goes wrong. He recently spent four hours inside the telescope, painstakingly applying a small device that will measure the Webb’s movements during a motion test. He said that working on something that has cost billions of dollars and years of effort is a little bit stressful, but also exciting. With a tool in hand, he said, stepping inside the Webb is like playing “the ultimate game of Operation.” IF YOU GO What: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

Scientists have discovered the most distant galaxy ever confirmed, whose light took just over 13 billion years to reach Earth, providing a snapshot of the early universe. The faraway system resides in the night sky just above the handle of the Big Dipper. One curious trait about the record-breaker is that it forms stars at an incredible rate, about 330 per year — more than a hundred times faster than our Milky Way galaxy. This could be a trademark of the universe’s early days, when hydrogen gas for star formation was much more plentiful. “We wanted to figure out how galaxies evolve,” said Steven Finkelstein, lead author and University of Texas at Austin astronomer. “One way to do that is to push back deeper and deeper into the history of the universe.” The study was published online Wednesday in the journal Nature. At first, the landmark discovery was a little bit of a let-down, the scientists said. The team of astronomers used images from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify 43 possible faraway galaxies and then used state-of-the-art spectrographic equipment at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to confirm their distances. In the end, Finkelstein and his colleagues could only retrieve data from this lone galaxy. “We were first excited, then a little disappointed because we only saw one, and then excited again,” he said. “We would have hoped for some number bigger than one.” With advances in instrumentation technology, astronomers continue to stretch their detection capabilities further outward from the Milky Way. Because light takes time to travel such long distances, remote objects allow them to peer back through time. Take the sun as a simple example, said study author and Texas A&M University astronomer Vithal Tilvi. Sunlight takes a little over eight minutes to reach Earth. “That means that when we are looking at the sun, we are actually looking at the sun as it was eight minutes ago,” he said. In comparison, the light detected from this outlying galaxy — with the official catalogue name z8_GND_5296 — left the galaxy 13.1 billion years ago. This gives us a glimpse of the universe as it was when it was only 700 million years old. In other words, we’re looking 95 percent of the way back to the Big Bang. To put that into human terms, that would be like an 80-year-old watching a video of himself on his fourth birthday. “From observing these distant galaxies, we can understand how the universe was when it was very young,” Tilvi said. “There’s no other way to look into the past.” Setting out to find the most distant galaxy isn’t a single eureka moment, but rather a careful process of confirmation and remeasurement. Further-away galaxies than z8_GND_5296 have been identified but failed a double-check process along the way. The team first perused a month’s worth of images from the Hubble telescope for possible candidate galaxies. Hubble avoids the snags that Earth-bound telescopes can run into, such as clouds and bad weather, to more easily spot the red blobs that signal a distant object. The same effect that causes a passing ambulance siren to change pitch as it zooms by, called the Doppler shift, makes the most distant galaxies appear red. Because the universe is expanding, the galaxy’s light moves away from us and gets stretched into a redder wavelength. “These galaxies from within the first billion years of the universe are so far away that they have shifted into the infrared, or redder than our eyes can see,” Finkelstein said. How red the light of the object is gives some sense of how far away it is, but a technique called spectroscopy is the true litmus test that accurately confirms the distance. The researchers spent two days at the Keck Observatory, near the summit of the Mauna Kea volcano, looking for a characteristic piece of data called the Lyman-alpha emission line. The Lyman-alpha line tends to be a bright signature of old-universe galaxies that are forming stars at a high rate. Once found for a particular galaxy, an exact distance from Earth can be calculated. Although disappointing at first, finding only one Lyman-alpha line is an intriguing discovery, the scientists say. One theory says that, after cooling down from the Big Bang, a cosmic fog of neutral hydrogen gas cloaked our early universe. “That was the case until the very first galaxies lit up,” said Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who was not involved in the study. “They produced the ultraviolet radiation that broke up hydrogen.” Gradually, the universe started a “reionization” process — first with bubbles of ionization around individual stars, then dwarf galaxies. As those young galaxies grew in size and overlapped, they formed larger regions of ionization that eventually became today’s fully ionized universe. “Perhaps we are seeing the evidence that it ended right around this galaxy,” Loeb said, and this one happened to peek through the fog where the other 42 candidates could not. Loeb also believes the unusually high star-formation rate may have to be reconfirmed. Although there are other galaxies that birth hundreds of stars per year, they are often quite massive, while z8_GND_5296 is considered a dwarf galaxy. “It’s not unusual to find small galaxies at those early times, but finding such a small galaxy making so many stars at once is unusual,” he said.

"The universe's biggest space telescope is as tall as a three-story building and as wide as a tennis court. Its main mirror, a collapsible honeycomb of 18 gleaming, gold-covered hexagons, is large enough to collect light from the very first, most distant stars and sensitive enough to capture the heat signature of a bumblebee on the moon. Someday — someday soon, NASA officials hope — it will soar a million miles above Earth, giving astronomers an unprecedented glimpse at the edge of space and the beginning of time. On Wednesday, they were content to admire their new telescope as it gleamed beneath the fluorescent lights of the sterile ""cleanroom"" at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ""It sure is shiny,"" one woman said. That's the least of the adjectives you could use to describe the James Webb Space Telescope, a 14,300-pound, $8.8 billion piece of hardware more than two decades in the making. It has been hailed as revolutionary and questioned as a boondoggle, and at times there were doubts about whether it would even come to be. In 2011, with work on the telescope behind schedule and over budget, Congress nearly voted to scrap the program. A compromise kept things going, with a new launch date of October 2018. Earlier this year, engineers finished assembling the gigantic mirror, and this week they removed its protective coverings for the first time. No one at NASA had seen the assembled telescope in all its gilded splendor before — not even the JWST program director, Eric Smith. ""It's amazingly beautiful,"" Smith said. ""I’ve seen this as PowerPoints and CAD drawings for about 20 years now. But to actually see those dreams made manifest is really pretty moving."" Named for second NASA administrator James Webb, the telescope is an engineering feat. Its primary mirror, at more than 250 square feet, and two smaller mirrors are designed to collect and focus some of the faintest light in the universe. It is far larger than any other telescope that NASA has launched — the primary mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope, which JWST will be replacing, has less than one-fifth of the collecting area — and it will be orbiting at a much colder and more distant point in space. That meant that NASA had to come up with entirely new ways to build it. Each hexagon in the mirror is made of lightweight beryllium, which can withstand the minus-388-degree temperatures the telescope will encounter in space. The hexagons are coated with a thin layer of gold because the element is the best reflector of infrared light, the wavelength that marks extremely far-off objects (the universe's expansion causes waves of light to stretch out as they travel through space and time, a phenomenon called ""red shifting""). The JWST will be able to detect light from stars that formed 13.5 billion years ago — a mere 200 million years after the Big Bang, the cosmic equivalent of the blink of an eye. And it's portable, too: The mirror was designed to fold up like an immense origami figure, so it can fit onto the rocket that will carry it into orbit. In another corner of the cleanroom at Goddard, engineers in white protective suits and blue gloves cluster around the JWST's instrument box, which will be affixed to the back of the telescope after each component has been tested. There will be four scientific instruments on board when JWST is launched — two provided by NASA and one each from the Canadian and European space agencies. Each is designed to sense light at a specific range of wavelengths, allowing the telescope to, say, peer through clouds of dust and gas to watch new stars in the making, or gaze back through time and space to capture the faint light of the most distant galaxies. The instruments are essential to JWST's four scientific missions: finding the earliest stars and galaxies, understanding how galaxies evolved, observing the formation of new stars and solar systems, and scanning Earth's neighboring planets for their chemical properties and signs of life. But first they must all fit into their box, an effort that Lynn Chandler, the JWST program's spokeswoman (and unofficial hype woman), describes as ""the ultimate game of Operation."" ""You've got to get it all in there, and you can't touch anything,"" she said. Leaving even the smallest eyelash or faintest smudge on the equipment could have catastrophic consequences for the telescope — like getting dirt on your contact lens, if your contact lens were as big as an RV and a million miles away from any cleaning solution. A group standing on the viewing platform joked about what would happen if scientists identified a fantastic new galaxy, then realized it was actually someone's fingerprint. There's no chance of that happening, Chandler said. The cleanroom is orders of magnitude cleaner than an operating room, and the engineers and technicians in it are covered from their booties to their surgical caps. Only their eyes peer out over their face masks. They will continue assembling and testing the equipment at Goddard — a process that includes shaking it inside a launch simulator and blasting it with noise so loud that it chips paint from the walls — then send the telescope and instruments on to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. In late 2017, they will head to contractor Northrop Grumman's facility in Redondo Beach, Calif., to meet up with their spacecraft and kite-shaped sun shield (which protects the telescope from interference from the sun). Then it's on to the launch site in French Guiana, where the whole ensemble is due to take off in October 2018. NASA estimates that the telescope will begin sending back data roughly six months after that. This time three years from now, scientists could be gazing at some of the oldest things they have ever seen. ""The telescope is really humanity's deep-space exploration device,"" Smith said. ""... Our curiosity drives us to ask what is out there, and this is the ultimate expression of that."" He adds: ""It won't be the last.""

NASA's troubled James Webb Space Telescope continues to enjoy congressional support, but lawmakers Thursday expressed dismay with the performance of Northrop Grumman, the huge aerospace contractor that has made a series of errors delaying the telescope's launch until 2021 at the earliest. Wes Bush, the company's chief executive, found himself on the defensive as he testified before the House Science Committee. He refused repeatedly to specify how much profit his company made last year. The Webb telescope was conceived in 1996 as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and NASA had originally hoped to launch it in 2007. It is an infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter-wide segmented mirror, and it has to be kept cold to gather light emitted in the early universe when stars were just starting to form galaxies. This requires a tennis-court-sized, five-layer sun shield that has to unfold in space. In a shake test in April, screws came loose from the sun shield, just the latest in a series of technical glitches and human errors at Northrop Grumman. An independent review board this summer urged NASA and Congress to keep the program going but said there were 344 potential “single-point failures” that could doom the telescope with a single mistake, and it urged greater care in rooting out technical problems. The latest cost estimate of the project is $9.7 billion, most of that already spent. Bush admitted that mistakes at Northrop Grumman had been a factor in the delays. He pledged that the company would put all of its past profits and potential future profits — known as “award fees” — into a common pot to be awarded only if the telescope is successful. But he pushed back when House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) asked him whether the company would consider paying for the latest $800 million cost overrun out of its own pocket. Bush said that would transform the company's cost-plus contract with NASA into a fixed-price contract, and would “significantly impair” the relationship between the company and NASA. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) scoffed at comments made by Bush and other lawmakers about how the Webb will inspire young people. “I'm sorry that I cannot join you in this uplifting testimony that you've given today. Mr. Bush, I don’t think we should look to our young people and give them an example of being, you know, eight times over budget and twice as long,” he said. He added, “You can say, 'Is the Jim Webb telescope going to be worth all that money?' That's not what the question is. The question is, 'Is it worth all those other projects that we have been unable to fund in this committee because you have failed your job?' ” He asked Bush how much profit Northrop Grumman made last year. Bush replied that that's in government filings. “Is it hundreds of millions or billions?” the congressman asked. “It's a very large number,” Bush said. The tension in the room peaked at the end of Bush's testimony, when Smith pressed Bush on whether anyone had been fired for the errors with the Webb project and then tried anew to get Bush to discuss company profits. Smith: “You do not know as CEO whether any employees lost their job because of the human error?” Bush: “With respect to the mistakes we’re talking about here today, I do not recall any losing their jobs.” Smith: “What was Northrop’s profit last year in 2017 just to the nearest tenth of a billion?” Bush: “We can get you that for the record.” Smith: “I’m sorry?” Bush: “We can provide that for you for the record.” Smith: “Why won’t you tell us today what it is?” Bush: “I don’t have it in front of me.” Smith: “How could a CEO not know what the profit of his company was last year?” Bush: “We will provide that to you for the record.” The chairman gave up. The company's financial report for 2017 states that it had pretax earnings of slightly more than $3 billion. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine had testified before the same committee on Wednesday and found himself in friendly territory. He served on the science committee as a Republican representative from Oklahoma until earlier this year, when he was confirmed as President Trump's pick to run the space agency. Bridenstine acknowledged that the Webb delays will force NASA to “cannibalize” funding meant for other missions. But he extolled the scientific virtues of Webb and said, “We're on the 5-yard line, and we're trying to punch it into the end zone.” Although he faced some scolding comments, his former colleagues were generally gentle. The most pointed remarks came from Rohrabacher, who began by saying: “This, of course, is very disturbing. This is about the biggest screw job I’ve ever seen, and the taxpayers are getting screwed here.” Read more: NASA's next great space telescope is stuck on Earth after screwy errors A 12-mile-wide body of liquid water lies beneath a Mars ice cap Cassini was the mission of a lifetime for this NASA scientist	645	"[{""start"": 491, ""end"": 579, ""text"": ""The Webb telescope was conceived in 1996 as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 632, ""end"": 819, ""text"": ""It is an infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter-wide segmented mirror, and it has to be kept cold to gather light emitted in the early universe when stars were just starting to form galaxies"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	624	2023-04-15T19:51:20.786105Z	2023-04-15T19:51:20.786207Z	370.717
The world’s most expensive telescope is parked for the moment in Greenbelt, Md., shrouded in a protective tent at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. In just two years, this long-delayed, $8 billion, cosmos-penetrating instrument is supposed to be nearly a million miles from Earth. If it works, the James Webb Space Telescope will collect the oldest light in the universe, emitted soon after the big bang, when the first stars lit up and the first galaxies began to form. It will study black holes lurking at the center of galaxies. It will scrutinize the light from planets around distant stars and look for atmospheres you’d expect to see on worlds rioting with life. But that’s only after an epic journey. It’s not a straight shot from the Washington suburbs to space. The telescope first must be sealed in a climate-controlled container. Then, sometime in late March or early April, a truck will haul it very slowly and gently in the dead of night along a partially closed Capital Beltway. A lead car will watch for road obstacles and potholes. Arriving at Joint Base Andrews, the Webb should slide, barely, into the cargo hold of a C-5C military transport plane. Then comes a flight to Houston, to the NASA Johnson Space Center, where it will be tested in a vacuum chamber that will simulate the environment of deep space. From Houston it will be flown to Los Angeles, to a facility run by the project’s primary contractor, Northrop Grumman, where it will be mated with its sunshield and navigational hardware. Then comes a boat ride, one that will carry the telescope down the southwestern coast of North America and through the Panama Canal to French Guiana. That’s where, in October 2018, it will be blasted into space atop a European Ariane rocket — a quarter-century after the Webb was conceived. What could go wrong? “It’s wonderful and terrifying,” says astronomer Heidi Hammel of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, one of six scientists guaranteed observing time with the instrument. “The terrifying part comes because we know that this is rocket science for real, we are taking our fabulous telescope — it’s a beautiful machine — and we’re going to put it on a rocket ship and light the fuse.” Astronomers have a complicated and anguished relationship with the Webb. It’s amazing. It’s also wildly expensive. And it was supposed to be in space years ago. John Mather, a Nobel laureate who is the senior project scientist, began working on it in 1995. He and his team had to achieve a long list of innovations to get the Webb built — things like the gold-covered mirrors, the sunshield and the means of keeping everything very cold. “This job was just so hard, and when you’re at the beginning you don’t have the imagination to see how hard it is. No one had appreciated the difficulty of the test program,” he said this week. Cost overruns led to budget reviews, battles in Congress, near-death experiences, recrimination and, finally, to a reconfigured budget and timetable that lawmakers approved. The project devoured NASA money that might have gone to other science endeavors. It became known as the telescope that ate astronomy. The Webb, which includes major contributions from the Canadian and European space agencies, has long been seen as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The latter is still working fabulously but getting long in the tooth. There have been rumors that the Trump administration could somehow gin up a Hubble repair mission with astronauts on a new shuttle-like spacecraft, but officials at NASA Goddard say they haven’t been asked to plan for anything like that. The Webb is quite different from the Hubble, starting with the fact that it’s much bigger. The Hubble has a 2.4-meter mirror, but the Webb has 18 hexagonal mirrors that collectively are 6.5 meters — more than 21 feet — in diameter. It can collect seven times as much starlight. The new telescope can observe the universe in infrared wavelengths of light that are inaccessible to the Hubble. In deep space, shaded from the sun, the Webb is designed to operate under extremely cold conditions. That’s necessary for infrared astronomy because otherwise the heat from its instruments would block out the faint light from distant objects. As things turned out, the Webb’s problems with schedule may have been fortuitous. The original goal was to look at very faint objects in deepest space — the very first stars and galaxies, so far away that their light, emitted about 13.7 billion years ago, is only now reaching our solar system. But the Webb may play a key role in the search for habitable worlds that are relatively nearby, orbiting stars in our own galactic neighborhood. The very first “exoplanet” — a planet orbiting another star — was discovered 22 years ago, right about the time Mather began working on the Webb. Thousands of exoplanets have been found since. Earlier this week, astronomers announced the remarkable discovery of a system with seven Earth-size planets around a star named Trappist 1, some 39 light-years away. Several have orbits that might allow water, if present, to be liquid at the surface. There’s no way for the Webb or any other current telescope to see these planets directly, because they’re too close to the parent star. But as they transit the star — passing across the face of the star as seen from the telescope — the starlight will dim slightly. That’s how they were discovered. An atmosphere around a planet will skew the wavelengths of the starlight. Astronomers can then use spectroscopy to discern which kinds of molecules make up the exoplanet atmosphere. The Hubble has looked at the Trappist system and already has determined that the planets are probably rocky rather than gaseous like Jupiter or Saturn. But the Webb has sophistication the Hubble lacks. The Webb can detect the clear signatures of atmospheres containing water, ozone, oxygen, methane and other molecules. That could provide compelling evidence of a habitable planet. As astrophysicist Michelle Thaller of NASA points out, while it wouldn’t be the same thing as direct detection of life, it would be a major achievement for the still-young scientific field known as astrobiology. Closer to home, the Webb’s prime viewing targets include the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, Saturn’s intriguing moon Titan, the dwarf planet Pluto and its moon Charon, plus the gaggle of “trans-Neptunian objects” way out in the exurbs of the solar system — little-known worlds such as Sedna, Quaoar and Makemake. But first the telescope, which is supposed to begin observing in April 2019, has to function as planned. It would be hard to repair something parked at L2, the Webb’s destination point in space, which is 930,000 miles from Earth on the opposite side of our planet from the sun. “I can tell you that we’re doing what we need to do to make sure that it’ll work,” Mather said. “You test. And test and test.” And look for potholes along the way — literally.	644	"[{""start"": 3175, ""end"": 3333, ""text"": ""The Webb, which includes major contributions from the Canadian and European space agencies, has long been seen as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3642, ""end"": 3918, ""text"": ""The Webb is quite different from the Hubble, starting with the fact that it’s much bigger.

BALTIMORE Twinkling stars are pretty but, for astronomers, problematic. Twinkles are caused by the interference of Earth’s atmosphere with light radiating throughout the breathtakingly beautiful and unimaginably violent universe. In 1990, however, the Hubble telescope went into orbit 370 miles above Earth, beyond the atmospheric filter, peering perhaps 12 billion years into the past, almost to the Big Bang of 13.8 billion years ago. It has seen interesting things, including HD 189733b, a planet about 63 light-years (370 trillion miles) away, where winds exceed 4,000 mph and it rains molten glass. As Hubble nears the end of its life, its much more capable successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, named for a former NASA administrator, is being developed at Johns Hopkins University. The campus has several history departments. Some study humanity’s achievements during its existence, which has been barely a blink in cosmic time. Other historians — the scientists and engineers of the Space Telescope Science Institute — study the origins of everything in order to understand humanity’s origins. In 2018, Webb will be situated 940,000 miles from Earth, orbiting the sun in tandem with Earth, to continue investigating our place in the universe. Our wee solar system is an infinitesimally small smudge among uncountable billions of galaxies, each with uncountable billions of stars. Our Milky Way galaxy, where we live, probably has 40 billion planets approximately Earth’s size. Looking at the sky through a drinking straw, the spot you see contains 10,000 galaxies. Yet the cosmos is not crowded: If there were just three bees in America, the air would be more congested with bees than space is with stars. Matter, however, is not all that matters. The United States’ manned moon expeditions ended in 1972, but modern cosmology began with the 1965 discovery that the universe is permeated with background radiation. This, like everything else, is a residue of the Big Bang, which, in a hundredth of a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, set stuff — some of it now congealed into galaxies — flying apart. The recipe for our biophilic (friendly to life) planet was cooked in the universe’s first one-hundredth of a second, at a temperature of a hundred thousand million degrees Celcius Einstein’s theory that space is curved by gravity requires a nonstatic universe, expanding or contracting. With a light-gathering mirror six times larger than Hubble’s, and operating in temperatures of minus-389 degrees Fahrenheit, Webb will gather extraordinarily faint light that has been traveling for billions of years since the Big Bang. With Webb looking back in time to a few hundred million years after the explosion, scientists will analyze light for clues concerning the earliest formation of stars, planets, galaxies and us. Hubble, which is the size of a school bus, supplies data for more than one-fifth of all scholarly astronomy papers. Webb, which will be the size of a tennis court, will advance knowledge about this stupendous improbability: How did material complexity, then single-cell life, then animals and consciousness emerge from chaos? Webb will not shed light on two interesting questions: How many universes are there? Is everything the result of a meaningless cosmic sneeze, or of an intentional First Cause? Webb will, however, express our species’ dignity as curious creatures. Since Copernicus’s great impertinence — displacing Earth and its passengers from the center of the universe — we have learned that “center” is senseless in an expanding universe that has no edge and where space and time are warped. Our solar system is not even the center of our galaxy. We know neither the conditions when, about 4 billion years ago, Earth became home for life, nor the processes that ignited life. But half of the 200 billion stars just in our Milky Way have planetary systems, so a basic question of religion — where did we come from? — leads to another: Are we — carbon- and water-based, oxygen-breathing creatures — alone? Earth revolves around our expiring sun, which is scheduled to burn out in just 5 billion years. At about that time, our Milky Way will collide with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy. This is not apt to end well. Meanwhile, however, the scientist-historians here will try to tickle from the cosmos information for its own sake. Space exploration began from Cold War imperatives, producing rocketry, intelligence satellites and national prestige. Webb, which only the United States could make happen, does not contribute to the nation’s defense, but, as its creators say with justifiable pride, it makes the nation all the more worth defending.

Inside a very big and very clean room at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., nearly 30 workers dressed in white protective suits, goggles and blue booties cluster around the parts of a time machine. These parts — gold-covered mirrors, tennis-court-size sun shields, delicate infrared cameras — are slowly being put together to become the James Webb Space Telescope. Astronomers are hoping that the Webb will be able to collect light that is very far away from us and is moving still farther away. The universe has been expanding ever since the big bang got it started, but scientists reckon that if the telescope is powerful enough, they just might be able to see the birth of the first galaxies, some 13.5 billion years ago. “This is similar to archaeology,” says Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who helped plan Webb’s science mission. “We are digging deep into the universe. But as the sources of light become fainter and farther away, you need a big telescope like the James Webb.” Named for a former NASA director, the 21-foot-diameter Webb telescope will be 100 times as powerful as the Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched in 1990. Although Hubble wasn’t the first space telescope, its images of far-off objects have dazzled the public and led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining how fast the universe is expanding. The Webb will be both bigger and located in a darker part of space than Hubble, enabling it to capture images from the faintest galaxies. Four infrared cameras will capture light that is moving away from us very quickly and that has shifted from the visible to the infrared spectrum, described as red-shifted. The advantage of using infrared light is that it is not blocked by clouds of gas and dust that may lie between the telescope and the light. Webb’s mirrors are covered in a thin layer of gold that absorbs blue light but reflects yellow and red visible light, and its cameras will detect infrared light and a small part of the visible spectrum. As objects move away from us, the wavelength of their light shifts from visible light to infrared light. That’s why the Webb’s infrared cameras will be able to see things that are both far away and moving away from us. The cameras will also probe the atmospheres of planets that revolve around nearby stars, known as exoplanets, for the chemical signatures of life: water, oxygen and maybe even pollution from alien civilizations. But before any of that dazzling science happens, there’s a lot of testing to do at Goddard, in the clean room and a nearby “cryo-chamber.” Various tests will squeeze, shake, freeze and twist thousands of individual parts in an effort to make sure the spacecraft will survive blastoff from a spaceport in French Guyana and the cold environment of its orbiting position almost a million miles from Earth. By comparison, Hubble circles just 375 miles above our planet, depending on its orbit. The project, which began in 2004, peaks in October 2018 when the telescope is launched on an Ariane 5 rocket from the European Space Agency. From now on, NASA engineers will find the pace picking up and deadlines getting even tighter. As a young engineer in the early 1990s, Paul Geithner helped fix tiny bumps on Hubble’s glass mirror, a flaw discovered after the telescope was in space. Today, at 52, Geithner is making sure everything stays on track on the Webb assembly line at Goddard. He says testing of individual parts, including each of the 18 hexagonal mirrors, the backplane (which NASA describes as the spine holding the mirrors) and all the scientific instruments will be done by the end of this year. Beginning in early 2015, portions of the telescope and its spacecraft will be joined together with special glue and bolts. “It’s not feasible to test it as a complete system,” said Geithner, NASA’s deputy project manager for technical issues. “So what that means is we have to test different pieces of it and convince ourselves through testing and analysis that when it’s put together, it will work.” Back in the 1990s, NASA sent shuttle astronauts to repair Hubble’s mirror during a dangerous operation that required five days of spacewalks. But that’s not an option for the Webb: It will be parked too far away. Geithner said everybody learned lessons from the Hubble mistake, which NASA blamed on a contractor. Now, the need for independent testing of the optical surfaces is clear. “You don’t use the same tools that you use to make the optics to tell you it is okay,” he said. This year concluded several “cryo-tests” (testing reactions at extremely low temperatures), in which the boxlike structure containing the infrared cameras — called the Integrated Science Instrument Module, or ISIM — was lowered into a 60-foot-tall vacuum chamber at Goddard. The air was pumped out to simulate conditions in space, liquid nitrogen flooded an inner chamber and super-cooled helium was pumped into a smaller interior chamber. The four-camera package faced temperatures of 11 degrees Kelvin, which is minus-440 degrees Fahrenheit. “The biggest stress is not the shaking from the [spacecraft] launch,” Geithner explained. “But the whole thing shrinks when it cools down, so there’s a lot of stress on the joints and it tries to tear itself apart.” ISIM survived the cryo-test in July, was warmed up to room temperature and then removed from the cryo-chamber in October. It needs to be pulled apart, then put back together for final tests next year. Measuring everything twice means the Webb telescope will function as it is supposed to, according to Geithner. But the extra testing is expensive. Cost overruns and early delays nearly killed the project in 2011. Webb’s price tag soared from initial estimates of $1 billion in the late 1990s to the current figure of $8.8 billion. But Congress gave NASA a second chance, and the agency revised its construction budget to keep it within limits. Still, the Webb is NASA’s most expensive science mission. Some critics say it has sucked money away from other worthy projects, such as other missions around the solar system or monitoring environmental changes on Earth. NASA chief Charles Bolden told Goddard workers in February that the project is on budget and on schedule, as long as Congress keeps the money flowing. In the meantime, scientists such as Sara Seager of MIT, who studies exoplanets that revolve around distant stars, are imagining the discoveries that will occur once Webb directs its mirrors toward deep space. As a planet moves in front of a star, researchers hope to see the fingerprints of its atmosphere, which absorbs starlight. By analyzing the chemical spectrum of the light, they may be able to determine the atmosphere’s composition. Oxygen has a spectral fingerprint, as does methane, carbon dioxide and other gases found in atmospheres. Seager and other scientists can point the Hubble at exoplanets, but they don’t get much time to use it because the entire telescope heats up and cools down as it passes from day to night. Exoplanet hunters need to point the telescope for a long time at one place. The Webb telescope represents a big step forward, according to Seager, because it won’t be bothered by light or radiation from the sun and the Earth and therefore will be able to see more-distant objects. (A five-layer sun shield and distance from the Earth will protect the telescope.) “Anytime you put something new in space, the astronomy world changes dramatically,” Seager said. When NASA began planning the Webb telescope, exoplanets were just being discovered. The early ones were huge, Jupiter-size bodies that were too cold or too poisonous to harbor the conditions needed for life. Now, scientists have found more than 5,000 exoplanets, from big gas giants to smaller rocky worlds that lie within what’s called the “Goldilocks zone” — neither too close nor too far away from their star, meaning conditions are neither too hot nor too cold. “These [space telescopes] take so long to build,” Seager said. “Originally we didn’t know about the richness of exoplanets, and we didn’t know they were so diverse. I see the James Webb as the tool for the second generation of exoplanet studies.” As they wait for the Webb’s launch in four years, Seager and other planetary scientists are drawing up a list of star systems that could be candidates for the first studies. Seager says she likes to remind people about the value of big, complex scientific projects, even if they cost a lot of money, take a long time to build and don’t have a concrete scientific payoff. “As a nation, should we be building complicated things and pushing the limit of progress in technology? It’s a question I like to pose to people,” she said. “Should we just get by, or is it critical for our future to invest in complicated technologies? That usually makes them think for a while.” Niiler is a freelance writer.

You may have heard that astronomers made a big announcement today about a “discovery outside our solar system.” It wasn't aliens. Instead, astronomers reported the discovery of a solar system containing seven rocky, Earth-size planets just 39 light years away. The bodies orbit an ultracool dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1 in the constellation Aquarius. Several of the planets are located in what's known as the “habitable zone” — the Goldilocks region where it's thought water can exist and life can thrive. This is the first time astronomers have discovered so many terrestrial planets orbiting a single star, and this new system could be the best target in the galaxy to search for extraterrestrial life. Even they aren't home to aliens, TRAPPIST-1 will provide planetary scientists with an unprecedented new window on the formation of solar systems and the behavior of rocky worlds. So, sure, this is a really cool discovery. Even if I hadn't watched “Contact” over the weekend, I'd be daydreaming about visiting TRAPPIST-1, where transits are a daily spectacle and the star's dim glow gives the appearance of a perpetual sunset. Just add an ocean and a few palm trees, and it's hard to imagine a better vacation spot. But I'm not packing my bags just yet, and you probably shouldn't either. Here's why: TRAPPIST-1 is 39 light years away. Yes, that is crazy close in the scheme of the universe. The Milky Way galaxy alone is 100,000 light years across. But even if humanity had a spacecraft capable of moving at the speed of light, it would take almost four decades to get to TRAPPIST-1. I don't know about you, but I don't have that many vacation days. It's kind of a wimpy star. TRAPPIST-1 is an ultracool dwarf star, 10 times smaller and 2.5 times cooler than our own sun. In fact, it's more comparable to Jupiter than to the sun. Even though the TRAPPIST-1 planets are Earthlike, the system is definitely an alien one. It's not clear what the likelihood of life might be in such a system. How close is too close? The planets of this system orbit in super tight circles around their sun. The entire system is barely bigger than the distance between the sun and Mercury. This is what lets them stay warm by their star's dim light, but it also puts them at risk. Solar flares could damage their atmospheres (if they have atmospheres), radiation could blast away any nascent life (if life even emerged). Michael Gillon, the lead author of the study, said that TRAPPIST-1 is a relatively quiet star, and the level of radiation the planets probably receive doesn't look totally hostile to life. But it's still something to worry about. The planets don't have days and nights.  Because the planets are close to the sun, and to one another, the astronomers believe that they are “tidally locked.” This is what happens when the amount of time it takes a body to orbit matches the length of one rotation on its axis. The result is that the same side of the body always faces the object it orbits around. The moon is tidally locked with Earth, which is why we always see the same face of our satellite when we look up at night. For the planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system, this means that one side of each body is constantly blasted with their sun's heat, while the other sides are perpetually in darkness. This … doesn't sound very homey. It could create huge temperature gradients that drive powerful winds. It could mean that half of each planet freezes while the other half burns. We can't see the planets directly.  Scientists were able to detect the planets using the “transiting method,” in which they use tiny dips in light from the star caused by the planets passing across its face. With the Hubble Space Telescope, the soon-to-launch James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based observatories, astronomers can also analyze the light that passes through the atmospheres of the planets to figure out what molecules those atmospheres contain. But we won't be able to directly image the solar system with current technology, Gillon said. Because the planets are so close to their star, they will be impossible to distinguish amid its glare. Just because some of the planets are in the habitable zone doesn't mean that they're actually habitable, let alone inhabited. The “habitable zone” is kind of a squishy concept. Astronomers define it as the range of orbits around a given star at which planets are warm enough to sustain liquid water on their surface. But it's all theoretical. Scientists assume that a middling distance from the sun and liquid water make a planet habitable because they're so essential to life on Earth. But there are ways for bodies to hold water even if they're far away from their stars. Just look at Europa, the moon of Jupiter that is thought to have a vast, salty ocean beneath its icy surface. Plus, lots of liquid water isn't necessarily a good thing. In a paper published in the journal Science in 2013, astrophysicist Sara Seager pointed out that water is a greenhouse gas — too much of it too close to a star could trap heat on a planet and turn it into something like Venus. Besides, a planet requires a lot more than water and light to be livable. Scientists think Mars once had water, but when its internal dynamo broke down, it lost its atmosphere and became the frozen desert we know today. Truly habitable planets probably need strong magnetic fields to protect their inhabitants from radiation and fierce solar winds. Amy Barr Mlinar, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, pointed out that, in some ways, life is a requirement for life. “Geology and life have worked together to make the Earth habitable,” she said. Without photosynthetic organisms to create oxygen, fungi to recycle waste products, bacteria to fix nitrogen in the soil, our planet would be unrecognizable. Even with all these caveats, the planets are really, really exciting.  “There are other worlds out there just like the Earth that have some commonalities with the Earth and we can imagine them,” NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen said at a news conference Wednesday. “The question, 'Are we alone out here?' is being answered as we speak.” There are 100 billion stars in our galaxy, and it's thought that about 15 percent of them are ultracool dwarfs like TRAPPIST-1. If even a fraction of those stars host multiple planet systems, and even a fraction of those have terrestrial planets in the habitable zone, there could potentially be millions of rocky worlds waiting for us to explore. “The discovery gives us a hint that finding a second Earth is not just a matter of if, but when,” Zurbuchen said.  But we don't need to wait to find other Earthlike exoplanets. The TRAPPIST-1 system has offered up seven such worlds, and they're right within our sights. All scientists have to do now is point their telescopes at it and look.	641	"[{""start"": 3684, ""end"": 4034, ""text"": ""With the Hubble Space Telescope, the soon-to-launch James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based observatories, astronomers can also analyze the light that passes through the atmospheres of the planets to figure out what molecules those atmospheres contain.
