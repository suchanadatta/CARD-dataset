A U.S. taxpayer-funded broadcaster this fall published a ­Spanish-language opinion piece warning that the “Islamization” of Europe by migrants is destroying the continent’s Christian character and posing a danger to the United States “greater than that from the Nazis in the 1940s.” The online piece followed stories by the same government-run publisher, Radio and Television Martí, that described philanthropist and prominent Democratic donor George Soros as a “nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals” and as a “left-wing billionaire of Hungarian-Jewish origin.” The federal agency that oversees Martí launched an internal investigation this fall after a May report about Soros was publicized and widely denounced. The probe has now expanded to include examining how Martí came to publish an earlier story that included anti-Semitic language about Soros, a U.S. citizen, as well as the anti-Muslim piece, the agency confirmed. Four Martí employees have been placed on leave and two contract staffers have been fired, according to Nasserie Carew, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for Global Media. All are reporters and editors, according to biographies on Martí’s website and on social media. Anchor Maite Luna, who said she was one of the fired contract staffers, told The Washington Post that she was only doing what she had been instructed to do by editors when she promoted May’s Soros report on her morning news program. Luna declined to say more, citing the advice of attorneys. The five other employees or contractors either declined to comment or could not be reached. For nearly three decades, Martí has broadcast news and other programs promoting U.S. interests to audiences in communist Cuba, seeking to circumvent state-controlled media. Martí spent nearly $29 million in 2017 on its mission to provide “accurate, balanced and complete information” to the island’s residents. Since June, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which operates Martí, has been run by Tomás P. Regalado, a former mayor of Miami. Martí referred questions to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or USAGM, which also oversees the more widely known Voice of America. In a statement Wednesday, ­USAGM said it is conducting a “full content audit” of Martí’s work to identify any unprofessional reporting. The agency also said it had provided “ethics and best practices training” for the staff of Martí and is hiring a “standards and practices” editor. Carew confirmed that the three pieces deemed offensive had been removed from Martí’s website, which is accessible to a Spanish-language audience around the world. May’s Soros story was publicized by a blogger in October, and the other Soros story was described in a report last month by El Nuevo Herald, a Spanish-language publication in Miami. The Post recovered Martí’s ­anti-Muslim opinion essay, published in September, from Google’s cache. It features a large image of Muslims kneeling in prayer in a street in Paris over the headline: “Europa + Arabia = Eurabia.” The article was written by Juan Felipe Benemelis, a Cuban-born author who has described himself as the “Spanish-language Kissinger” and has said he is “considered the foremost expert in Islamic culture, Africa, international politics and terrorism.” Benemelis did not respond to phone calls, emails or messages sent to a Facebook account where he posts often. His nearly 1,500-word essay decries the “Islamization that is happening in European cities,” describing it as the result not of desperate migration from war-torn countries but of a decades-old “deliberate strategy of Muslim leaders” to weaken opposition to sharia law and ultimately take over the continent. Benemelis portrays Islam as inherently violent and writes that Europeans must turn back Muslim migrants to save Western democracy and culture. “Christianity in Europe is in retreat, on the defensive, while Islam is on the offensive. . . . The West must stop the migrations and deconstruct the black history of its civilization that has been transmitted to us,” Benemelis wrote. Benemelis had never written for Martí before May, when he wrote three opinion pieces in nine days, including one suggesting that President Trump was improving conditions in the Middle East by taking a hard line against Iran. Carew said Benemelis was never paid for the four opinion pieces he wrote for Martí, and she declined to say whether Benemelis had any agreement with Martí that was terminated. The Post was also able to locate versions of Martí’s broadcasts about Soros still circulating on Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. The 88-year-old businessman and naturalized U.S. citizen has been a top donor to Democratic candidates in recent years. He has also become a focus of conspiracy theories, often cast as a puppet master behind forces impeding Trump. Commentators on Fox News have repeatedly asserted, without evidence, that Soros funded the advance of a migrant caravan that was approaching the U.S.-Mexico border. In October, Trump cited professionally printed signs held by protesters heckling the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to suggest Soros must be behind the effort. “The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad,” Trump tweeted. “Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love!” Three weeks later, a pipe bomb was discovered in Soros’s mail amid a series of similar mailings to prominent Democrats, allegedly sent by a Florida man, a fervent Trump supporter. Soros was unharmed. Two days after that, on Oct. 26, a U.S. researcher blogged about a nearly 15-minute “Special Report” on Soros that he spotted on Martí. The May report made sweeping and unfounded claims, including that Soros was secretly funding violent leftist uprisings to topple governments from Romania to Colombia. The report also falsely described Soros as “the architect of the financial collapse of 2008.” The video report, which aired in several installments, credited the U.S. conservative group Judicial Watch with “keeping an eye” on Soros. The report accused Soros of financially supporting a violent rebel group turned political party known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC — something Judicial Watch has asserted in writings before and after the Martí report. Laura Silber, a spokeswoman for Soros’s Open Society Foundations, said the Soros organization’s efforts in Colombia supported programs that embody “the essence of American ideals,” such as fighting corruption and promoting the rule of law. In letters last month apologizing to Soros and his organization, USAGM chief executive John F. Lansing, a former head of Scripps Networks, faulted the report’s “weak sourcing” and suggested that Judicial Watch may have been the only source. “I deeply regret that a USAGM network produced something that feeds into age-old tropes against the Jewish community, at a moment when anti-Semitism is growing at home and around the world,” Lansing wrote. Judicial Watch also appears to have served as the foundation for the earlier Martí report on Soros, which was unknown to Soros’s organization until The Post shared a link to the story last week. The existence of the Martí article was first reported in El Nuevo Herald, a sister publication of the Miami Herald. The Martí report, published on April 1, was written by Armando de Armas, who has written hundreds of articles for Martí over the past decade. De Armas did not respond to phone messages or one left on Facebook. The article reported that a lawsuit filed by the “prestigious Judicial Watch” was seeking documents that might show whether the State Department had subsidized Soros’s political activities. It also noted that Soros is of “Hungarian-Jewish origin.” Carew declined to say whether de Armas had been placed on leave or faced disciplinary action. He is not among the four federal workers named as being on administrative leave in connection with the investigation. In an interview, Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, said Martí and his organization were never in contact before the reports aired. Fitton declined to comment on whether he considers the Martí reports to be anti-Semitic. “I don’t speak Spanish. . . . I didn’t see the broadcast and I don’t know how it translated,” he said. In a statement, Silber, the spokeswoman for Soros’s organization, said that the apology ­USAGM offered for the one, previously known broadcast is no longer sufficient. “We appreciated that the initial apology made by the U.S. Agency for Global Media for its taxpayer funded anti-Semitic programming about George Soros, but it is now clear this was not a one-off incident,” Silber said. “We are deeply concerned to learn about additional content with the same nefarious, anti-Semitic undertones. USAGM needs to be much more forthcoming and Congress needs to conduct more vigorous oversight. In the end we want to know how this content got made, who made it, and who’s been held accountable so that it will not happen again.” aaron.davis@washpost.com	621	"[{""start"": 562, ""end"": 925, ""text"": ""The federal agency that oversees Martí launched an internal investigation this fall after a May report about Soros was publicized and widely denounced.

President Trump alleged last week that George Soros is paying people to protest at his rallies. A top executive at Campbell Soup tweeted that Soros was helping thousands of Central American migrants head in a caravan to the United States. The county clerk in Texas’s Harris County has warned that Soros wants to control local elections. The 88-year-old billionaire hedge fund founder, one of the country’s biggest Democratic donors and long a target of the right, has been the subject of escalating political attacks in the run-up to Election Day. On Facebook, several conservative groups — including the GOP House campaign committee — are running ads that feature Soros as a boogeyman, according to a review of political ad data released by the social media company. The charged rhetoric is drawing renewed criticism after Soros was among a group of prominent figures on the left targeted this week with homemade explosive devices. “America’s political leadership is stoking the fires of hate and unleashing a climate that tolerates violence and racism,” said Laura Silber, spokeswoman for Soros’s Open Society Foundations. “They are setting the tone at the highest offices. We are calling for restoring a level of civility and respect for other people’s opinions.” In response to a request for comment, a White House spokesman referred to a tweet by press secretary Sarah Sanders, in which she called the attempted bombings “despicable” and said “anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Trump said Wednesday that “we have to come together” and send the message that “threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.” Soros, who could not be reached for comment, told The Washington Post in a June interview that he was unfazed by efforts to demonize him. “I’m proud of my enemies,” he said. Many of the attacks on Soros have been fueled by his lengthy history of extensive political spending on behalf of liberal causes and candidates. Since 2010, he has plowed $39 million into super PACs aligned with Democrats, campaign finance records show. This cycle, he has donated $13.2 million so far to independent groups active in federal elections, including Priorities USA Action, a major Democratic super PAC; Win Justice, which focuses on voter turnout in battleground states; and Senate Majority PAC, which is aligned with Senate Democrats. In addition to his political giving, Soros’s Open Society Foundations is slated to spend about $1 billion this year promoting free speech and other issues in 100 countries, pouring much of his fortune into promoting liberal values and fighting a rising tide of nationalism, including in the United States. The nonprofit spends $150 million domestically, some of which helps funds groups such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Critics on the right — including the president — have stoked the image of Soros as an all-powerful financier, often claiming without evidence that he is responsible for grass-roots activities on the left. In Washington, he was blamed for the protests that erupted over the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In Harris County, Tex., County Clerk Stan Stanart claims on his campaign website that Soros wants to control local elections — a statement he has left up even after acknowledging it was based on unfounded rumor, the Houston Chronicle reported. In an interview with The Post on Wednesday, Stanart — whose office oversees voting in Houston and the surrounding county — said it was “a very strong rumor” and “there are grounds for saying Soros meddles in Harris County politics.” “Is he doing it now, I don’t know,” he acknowledged. “I haven’t had time to go back and update my website.” Trump has increasingly made references to Soros’s power, alleging during an Oct. 18 rally in Missoula, Mont., that people holding up signs for Democrats are “paid by Soros or somebody, right?” He said in an Oct. 11 interview with Fox News that “the Democrats and Soros” paid for protesters at prior rallies. On Facebook, Soros figures prominently in ads paid for by conservative organizations and GOP committees, according to an archive of politically themed ads posted online by the social media company. One of the biggest efforts is by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that is raising funds through a campaign it calls “Expose Soros.” One of its Facebook ads featured a black-and-white photo of Soros circled in red. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said in an interview that he is investigating whether U.S. taxpayer funds have backed Soros’s agenda. He said he saw nothing wrong with highlighting Soros to help raise money for his group. “This is not unusual for folks like Mr. Soros to rise in terms of public consciousness, especially because he is one of the biggest supporters of hard-left activism here and abroad,” Fitton said, adding that the bombing attempts would not affect his group’s campaign. “We will continue to investigate the intersection between the government and George Soros operations,” he said. House GOP leaders have also used Soros as a central figure in their midterm messaging. In an ad posted on Twitter on Tuesday night, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said in a video that Soros is one of three people funding the Democratic Party, along with hedge fund founder Tom Steyer and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. “We cannot allow Soros, Steyer and Bloomberg to BUY this election!” McCarthy tweeted. Matt Sparks, a spokesman for McCarthy, said that “the video simply points out the enormous financial contributions a select few have made in this year’s midterm campaigns. Any suggestion that content condones or incites violence is wrong.” Some of the harshest attacks on Soros this cycle have come from the National Republican Congressional Committee. One of committee’s video ads attacks a Democratic candidate for the House from Minnesota, Dan Feehan, an Iraq War veteran. The ad seeks to tie Feehan to “billionaire George Soros” who “bankrolls the resistance.” It shows Feehan wearing a badge that says he is “paid for by George Soros.” The video concludes with a picture of Soros and Feehan amid blazing fires. The NRCC released another ad Wednesday, which accused Feehan of being tied to the “radical George Soros.” Sean Oyaas, Feehan’s campaign manager, said in a statement that “these dishonest attacks are exactly what Minnesotans are tired of and represent a broken Washington.” A spokesman for the NRCC did not respond to a request for comment. A Facebook ad sponsored by Liberty Nation, a conservative website, shows two hands with puppet strings under the headline claiming Soros and Steyer were part of “the radical left out to buy Florida.” Liberty Nation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Steyer — whose staff stepped up security this week after the threats to Soros and other figures on the left — said in an interview Wednesday that he understands there are criticisms and risks involved with being a large donor. “If you’re trying to tell the truth and you’re trying to stick up for the American people and do the right thing and people criticize you for it, you’ve got to ignore them,” he said. On Monday, a vice president of government affairs of Campbell Soup, Kelly Johnston, tweeted a conspiracy theory that Soros’s Open Society Foundations sent “troop carriers” to support a caravan of migrants from Central America headed to the United States. He said that Soros’s group “planned and is executing this, including where they defecate.” Campbell Soup said in a statement that Johnston’s comment does not represent the company’s position. Tom Hushen, a company spokesman, said Johnston was not available for comment. The broadsides against Soros come amid intensifying threats of violence against figures across the political spectrum. Conservatives such as the Koch brothers and Kavanaugh have been targeted with death threats. Soros, a Holocaust survivor and self-described agnostic Jew, has long been subject to anti-Semitic attacks and even allegations that he collaborated with the Nazis. In the final days of the 2016 race, Trump spoke in his closing television ad about sending a tough message to “global special interests” who wanted to control Washington, as images of Soros and other financial leaders who are Jewish flashed on the screen amid footage of Clinton. Earlier this year, the actress Roseanne Barr tweeted that Soros is “a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth.” Barr’s message was retweeted by the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. In his interview with The Post, Soros said the allegation that he was a Nazi collaborator were “a total fabrication.” Soros has said he used false papers at age 13 to survive the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Barr later apologized for her tweet and said Soros “was persecuted by the Nazis.” Democrats on Wednesday criticized Trump and other Republicans for what they called incendiary comments about Soros. “The slurs against George Soros that Republicans continue to invoke are dredged up from centuries of nauseating anti-Semitism,” Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., (D-N.J.), said in a statement. “They have helped create an environment that has fostered all this.” One of Soros’s sons, Alexander, wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times on Wednesday that the rhetoric against his father “got worse” as a result of Trump’s presidential campaign, citing the ad that included an image of Soros. “A genie was let out of the bottle, which may take generations to put back in,” the younger Soros wrote. michael.kranish@washpost.com	620	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 94, ""text"": ""President Trump alleged last week that George Soros is paying people to protest at his rallies"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 239, ""end"": 335, ""text"": ""The county clerk in Texas’s Harris County has warned that Soros wants to control local elections"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 96, ""end"": 237, ""text"": ""A top executive at Campbell Soup tweeted that Soros was helping thousands of Central American migrants head in a caravan to the United States"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 548, ""end"": 771, ""text"": ""On Facebook, several conservative groups — including the GOP House campaign committee — are running ads that feature Soros as a boogeyman, according to a review of political ad data released by the social media company.

On Monday, a pipe bomb was sent to the home of George Soros, the liberal billionaire philanthropist whose name has become a part of conspiracy theories around the world. Investigators have concluded that the pipe bomb was probably hand-delivered, and it was “proactively detonated” by a bomb squad without causing injury to anyone at Soros’s home in New York’s Westchester County. Motives for the incident remain unclear. Law enforcement authorities have suggested that the same person who sent the device to Soros was also responsible for pipe bombs later sent to former president Barack Obama, former president Bill Clinton, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the CNN bureau in New York. But it’s no surprise that Soros would wind up as a target. He’s become the subject of escalating rhetoric on the right — including from President Trump — that posits Soros as a nefarious force, fomenting social dissent and paying members of a migrant “caravan” that has been the subject of intense right-wing fearmongering leading up to the November midterms. And that rhetoric draws on old, and deep-rooted, anti-Semitic ideas that have been deployed by the right for decades. On Oct. 5, Trump theorized on Twitter that Soros was behind vocal protests against Brett M. Kavanaugh’s appointment as a Supreme Court justice, stating that “the very rude elevator screamers” were “paid for by Soros and others.” More recently, extreme-right Rep. Matt Gaetz pointedly raised the question of whether Soros was paying members of the migrant caravan. More bizarrely, a top lobbyist for Campbell Soup Company was chastened by his patrons for suggesting on Twitter this week that Soros’s Open Society Foundation controlled the migrant caravan — “including where they defecate.” (I work at Media Matters for America, which received a $1 million donation from Soros in 2010, eight years before I joined.) The far right has ecstatically embraced the spectacle of elected political figures such as Trump and Gaetz theorizing about Soros. After Trump’s Soros tweet about Kavanaugh, the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer echoed and surpassed Trump’s assertion that anti-Kavanaugh dissent was a nefarious, paid-for plot. “It is impossible to deny that subversive anti-American Jews were the primary force involved in a sinister plot to destroy Kavanaugh,” Lee Rogers wrote on the site a couple of days later. “These Jews do not represent the interest of America. They represent the interest of their diabolical and evil race first and foremost.” In response to an Oct. 19 Trump speech in Missoula, Mont., in which Trump again suggested that protesters were paid by “Soros or somebody,” a commenter on anonymous message board 4chan exulted, “TRUMP NAMED THE IMMIGRATION JEW.” (“Naming the Jew” is an anti-Semitic term that refers to pointing out purported nefarious Jewish influence on world events.) The conspiracy theories around Soros, then, aren’t just expressions of bitter partisanship — and fact-checking-focused debunking that’s tempered coverage of the claims that he was involved in the caravan has skipped past an important subtext. Soros’s Jewish heritage is well known — his experiences in the Holocaust formed his identity as a philanthropist, in a decades-long effort to beat back a revanchist right. And his name has become a synonym for a well-worn anti-Semitic canard: the idea that Jews are malevolent fomenters of social dissent, agitators slyly funding and masterminding protest, seeking to undermine a white, Christian social order. It is a canard that resonates not just in European history, where the deadly consequences of anti-Semitic conspiracies are well-known, but throughout American history, and its renewed form draws on a long tradition of American anti-Semitism. Journalists who post simple, factual rebuttals to anti-Semitic conspiracies ignore their radical potency. The notion that “the Jew” — whether it is Soros or a more nebulous conspiracy — is behind expressions of social discontent serves as an explanation that casts protest as inherently “other,” caused by sinister forces that transcend ideological disagreement or authentic upset, and thus renders opposition inherently illegitimate. These anti-Semitic canards render Jews in America a permanently placeless “other,” perennially out to subvert the country they reside in. The idea that Jews are the malevolent eminence grise behind any upwelling of discontent is hardly new; in fact, it is not even new in the modern United States. Timothy McVeigh, a white nationalist terrorist who killed 168 in the infamous 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, drew much of his ideology from a 1978 white nationalist novel titled “The Turner Diaries.” The book, which prosecutors claimed helped inspire McVeigh, casts Jews as agents of social dissent in the civil rights era, upending an order in which black Americans had deferred naturally to whites. The book decries “the unique historical role of the Jews as the ferment of decomposition of races and civilizations”; accuses Jews of plotting to “manipulate and exploit the entire racial ‘equality’ movement for their own ends”; and ultimately calls for violence against Jews, stating, “Your day is coming, Jews, your day is coming!” While McVeigh’s ideological influences illustrate the potency of anti-Semitism as a political force on the American right, it dates back far longer. Anti-Jewish sentiment rose in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, egged on by such figures as Henry Ford and radio broadcaster Father Charles Coughlin, who crudely postulated that a communist threat to the United States was being controlled and catalyzed by Jewish agents. But perhaps the greatest rhetorical use of the Jewish “threat” was made by segregationists in the midcentury South, asserting that the civil rights movement of that era was nothing less than a wholesale Jewish plot to destroy the country. In “The Rabble Rousers: The American Far Right and the Civil Rights Era,” historian Clive Webb details the degree to which American Jews were blamed for fomenting the desire for social change in the form of racial integration. Webb describes the views of John Kasper, a Ku Klux Klan member and influential segregationist who ran a racist newspaper in the 1950s. “According to Kasper, the individuals, organizations and institutions that promoted racial integration were either Jewish or under the financial and political control of Jews,” Webb writes. “The NAACP, he insisted, did not represent the opinion of African Americans, most of whom accepted segregation of the natural social order, but rather acted on the instructions of its Jewish paymasters.” A local police officer investigating a 1960 synagogue bombing in Gadsden, Ala., was quoted by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency as stating, “You Jews brought it on yourselves by encouraging the Negroes to integrate.” Hatred of Jews among racists extended well beyond the height of the civil rights movement. J.B. Stoner ran for the U.S. Senate in Georgia on a platform of opposition to both black people and Jews in 1972 and decried serpentine, sneaky Jewish influence by calling Jews “vipers of hell.” To a B’nai B’rith leader, the 30,000 votes cast for Stoner, who finished fifth in Georgia’s Democratic primary, illustrated “how much raw bigotry still exists in our nation.” Soros has been the target of anti-Semitism more globally, too. In March, far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban gave a Jew-baiting speech denouncing Soros and his Open Society Foundations as “crafty” and someone who “speculates with money.” Orban said Soros was “not national but international.” This rhetoric echoed in a speech in which Trump declared that he was a “nationalist,” not a “globalist” — delivered on the same day Soros received a mail bomb. The term “globalist” is frequently used as a euphemism for Jew, including by far-right news site Breitbart, which surrounds Jewish former Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn’s name with globe emoji, for “globalist.” The notion of Jews as internationally beholden to some Jewish conspiracy and its goals, rather than serving as loyal subjects of their home countries, dates back at least to a 1920s pamphlet, “The International Jew,” published by Henry Ford. Nazi-era political cartoons depicted the Jew as an octopus, encircling the world with its many devious tentacles, exerting an irresistible, slimy control. Journalists who cover the contretemps around Soros today — and in particular, those responsible for providing explanation and context for Republican remarks around him — must not shy from the anti-Semitism inherent in right-wing attacks on the philanthropist. It’s not even hidden, at least not to the people hearing the dog-whistle: Searching “Soros” on Twitter or Facebook brings up conspiracy theories ranging from the subtly expressed to the downright deranged. Soros is merely the latest Jew whose public perception has been distorted by anti-Semites. While researching this article, I searched the term “antisemitism in the civil rights movement.” Google’s auto-complete response filled in the rest: “rothschild funded civil rights movement,” it spat forth, an algorithm blossoming immediately with the conspiracy it had taken half a century to sow. High-tech manifestations of anti-Semitism on social media belie the crude and ancient nature of the hatred. Anti-Semitism is a useful way to blame a hawk-faced, devious “other” for the rents in the social fabric that appear in tumultuous times. The attack is two-pronged: It renders authentic protest illegitimate, and it renders a tiny religious minority a seeking, devious force, whose vile otherness precludes tolerance. This kind of conspiracy theory is slick and burrowing, and it resists logic, casting itself as an undeniable truth. And it draws on a long history, in this country and elsewhere — one with the potential for incendiary violence in its clenched fist. Read more: Why do anti-Semites hate Jews?

A U.S. agency that broadcasts news and other programs into Cuba says it is seeking to fire a total of eight reporters, editors and anchors following an internal investigation into anti-Semitic segments last year that disparaged philanthropist and prominent Democratic donor George Soros. The three-part broadcast described Soros, a naturalized American citizen, as a “nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals” and as a “left-wing billionaire of Hungarian-Jewish origin.” The report alleged that Soros was working to undermine sovereign governments across Central America, a claim that John F. Lansing, the chief executive of the broadcaster’s parent agency, said had no merit. The reports were beamed into Cuba and spread to a Spanish-language audience online by Radio and Television Martí, a sister agency to the better-known Voice of America. Although Trump administration appointees have cycled through the broadcasting operation as Soros has emerged as a leading boogeyman on the right, the objectionable segments were the result not of interference but of a breakdown in editorial controls at the Miami-based Martí, the investigation found. “This was purely a matter of a rogue journalist who was being supervised poorly that allowed that terrible piece of content to be published,” said Lansing, the chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media. “There was no connection to anyone in the Trump administration, period.” One federal employee and three contractors at Martí were fired after an independent researcher and blogger first noticed and publicized the Soros reports in October, Lansing said. On Wednesday, he said, four additional reporters and editors were notified that USAGM is moving to fire them through a federal disciplinary process that could stretch out for months. Among those USAGM is seeking to terminate are two producers, writer Armando de Armas and the lead on-air reporter of the “investigative” series, Isabel Cuervo, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe personnel matters. Cuervo and de Armas did not respond to emails and messages left on social media Wednesday afternoon. The first federal employee let go late last year was Wilfredo Cancio, Martí’s former news director. In a December post on Facebook, Cancio blasted the investigation, saying USAGM had made him “a scapegoat to try to hide a long list of professional irregularities that have taken root” at Radio Marti. In a text message, Cancio declined to comment but said he would have more to say. Former morning anchor Maite Hernandez, who uses the on-air name Maite Luna, and morning producer Ibetti Perez — both contractors — have said they were among those fired and have alleged that they were terminated wrongfully. In a statement from her attorney, Perez said she was not aware of the topic of the report, did not participate in its formation and was not in the control booth when the Soros broadcast was promoted on the program she worked for. Hernandez said she, too, was not responsible. “I have all the documents to prove I have nothing to do with that story,” she said. “I just followed orders from my editors” to promote it, she said. Lansing said the actions taken by USAGM speak for themselves. “On its face, these reports were anti-Semitic and unjournalistic and violated our high standards of editorial content,” he said. “We found the eight people who we felt were the most responsible.” Lansing, a holdover from the Obama administration, also said — as he has before — that it appeared the conservative group Judicial Watch had served as the primary source for the report. “The person developing the Soros story was using Judicial Watch as a source as I understand it — the story was not only poorly sourced, it relied heavily on one less-than-credible source,” Lansing said. Judicial Watch has rejected the criticism of its work and said it never spoke to any Martí reporter. The group frequently criticizes Soros and what it says is his “radical left-wing agenda” being subsidized by U.S. foreign aid. Tom Fitton, the group’s president, said that with the firings, Lansing was “abusing his office to punish people critical of Mr. Soros.” Lansing said USAGM is beginning a broader content review that could result in further disciplinary action. The Washington Post reported in December that Martí published a ­Spanish-language opinion piece warning that the “Islamization” of Europe by migrants is destroying the continent’s Christian character and posing a danger to the United States “greater than that from the Nazis in the 1940s.” The author of that piece has not written for Martí since the Post report. “I’m confident we’ve found the root of the Soros reporting,” Lansing said. “I’ll reserve judgment on anything else until our content review is completed.” aaron.davis@washpost.com	619	"[{""start"": 7, ""end"": 286, ""text"": ""agency that broadcasts news and other programs into Cuba says it is seeking to fire a total of eight reporters, editors and anchors following an internal investigation into anti-Semitic segments last year that disparaged philanthropist and prominent Democratic donor George Soros"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 288, ""end"": 839, ""text"": ""he three-part broadcast described Soros, a naturalized American citizen, as a “nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals” and as a “left-wing billionaire of Hungarian-Jewish origin.” The report alleged that Soros was working to undermine sovereign governments across Central America, a claim that John F.

Conspiracy theories are flourishing in America, from the Oval Office to the fever swamps of the Internet. They include the viral notion that the liberal 88-year-old billionaire George Soros, a Hungarian American Holocaust survivor, is funding the migrant caravan slowly making its way from Central America in the direction of the United States. It’s not true, but it has apparently fueled homicidal rage in recent days. Cesar Sayoc, the Florida man whom authorities have accused of mailing more than a dozen bombs to people and organizations President Trump has criticized, appeared to be obsessed with Soros, mentioning him dozens of times on one of his Twitter accounts. Authorities say he mailed one of his bombs to Soros. Robert D. Bowers, charged with killing 11 people Saturday at a Pittsburgh synagogue, also reposted several viral comments on a since-deactivated social media account about the migrant caravan. One post described the “third world caravan” as a group of approaching “invaders.” Bowers directly posted a comment referring to “the overwhelming jew problem.” He spoke of the U.S. having a Jewish “infestation,” and reposted another user’s anti-Semitic comment: “Jews are waging a propaganda war against Western civilization and it is so effective that we are headed towards certain extinction within the next 200 years and we’re not even aware of it.” The Soros/caravan theory dates to late March, when an earlier wave of migrants was heading north, according to an extensive blog post on Medium by Jonathan Albright, director of the Digital Forensics Initiative at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. One Twitter post, which had no factual foundation, stated, “Caravan of 1,500 Central American Migrant Families Crossing Mexico to Reach U.S. Border All organized by Soros groups to cause more division.” The rumors circulated on closed Facebook groups and various right-wing websites, as well as on left-wing sites seeking to debunk them. They cropped up again in recent weeks when a new caravan started receiving attention among conservatives. President Trump warned without evidence that people from the Middle East were among the Central Americans. A Florida congressman, Matt Gaetz (R), posted a video on Twitter of someone supposedly handing cash to migrants to “storm the US border,” and he asked: “Soros?” Lou Dobbs, host of a show on Fox Business, tweeted on Oct. 23, “Do you think the Radical Left is working with Central and South American socialists and leftists to organize and support the migrant caravan?” As Albright put it: “There are no barriers for rumors, misinformation and memes. It’s ‘Rumors Without Borders.’ ” The Soros-caravan conspiracy theory weaves together anti-Semitism, fear of immigrants and the specter of powerful foreign agents controlling major world events in pursuit of a hidden agenda. And it appears to have had real-world consequences on Saturday for Jews attending services, including a baby-naming ceremony, in their synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Anti-Semitism has deep roots in American culture, dating to Colonial times and especially flourishing in the late 19th century when Jewish immigrants began arriving in large numbers. When automobile magnate Henry Ford took control of his local newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, in 1919, he published anti-Semitic columns eventually compiled into a book titled “The International Jew.” The newspaper translated and published “Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” an anti-Semitic hoax originally written in Russian and supposedly outlining a Jewish conspiracy to control the world. Ford spread his anti-Semitic theories by mailing newspapers to his car dealerships across the country. The effort by Ford and prominent anti-Semitic preachers such as Father Coughlin aroused a latent anti-Jewish fervor, and a pro-Nazi rally in 1939 at New York’s Madison Square Garden drew an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 at which German American Bund leader Fritz Kuhn decried the “Jewish-controlled press” and called for a “white, Gentile-ruled United States.” In the 21st century, the Internet and social media have allowed paranoia and rage to spread virally, and have enabled hateful ideologues and racists to find one another and find affirmation for their toxic beliefs. They find common purpose in defining and demonizing their perceived enemies. “The Jews are just the usual suspects,” said Bob Goldberg, a professor at the University of Utah and author of “Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America.” The normalization of conspiracy theories can have lethal consequences “in a nation armed to the teeth,” he said. “Most anti-Semitism is in some way based on some form of conspiracy theory,” said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. “Conspiracies that used to be on the margin, almost laughable, are now becoming literally part of the public discussion.” Conspiracy theories can be reassuring to people: They impose a kind of order on a chaotic world. They tell people there’s a reason things happen the way they do. And bad people are to blame. “With conspiracy theories, there’s kind of a common belief that there’s a group of actors, usually more powerful than typical citizens, engaging in unknown, usually nefarious, black-box activities,” said Christina Farhart, an assistant professor of political science at Carleton College. One of the most prominent 21st-century conspiracy theories comes from the “truthers.” They claim that Sept. 11, 2001, was an inside job, known to the U.S. government at the highest levels. A common variant is that the World Trade Center towers were destroyed by explosives, not by planes. Truthers are an ideological mix, including many on the political left, although perhaps the most famous is Alex Jones, the right-wing provocateur who has promoted a litany of “false flag” conspiracy theories. Perhaps the most politically prominent conspiracy theory came from the “birthers.” They believe former president Barack Obama was not born in the United States (he was born in Hawaii). Some claim he is a Muslim (he’s a Christian). The theory feeds into the “Manchurian Candidate” scenario — that Obama was secretly an agent of a foreign power. The most prominent person to embrace the birther conspiracy theory in the early years of this decade was Donald Trump. Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific ideas that have a conspiratorial element — including the false assertions that climate-change science is a Chinese hoax and that vaccines cause autism. “I don’t know if the whole country is becoming unhinged. Part of the problem is we have a president who pushes conspiracy theories, and he put together a coalition of conspiracy-minded Republicans to support him,” said Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami and co-author of “American Conspiracy Theories.” “During the campaign he was spewing conspiracy theories constantly — whether it was the birther thing or Ted Cruz’s dad killed JFK,” Uscinski said. “If you put Donald Trump’s campaign into perspective, he was talking about trade deals and immigrants all the time, because that’s something Americans historically are conspiracy-theorizing about.” Trump’s conspiracy-mongering has not abated since he took office. But he has distanced himself from one term, “deep state,” that has an ominous tinge to it. Trump recently told the Hill that he doesn’t like the term “because it sounds so conspiratorial, and believe it or not I’m really not a conspiratorial person.” joel.achenbach@washpost.com	618	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 344, ""text"": ""iracy theories are flourishing in America, from the Oval Office to the fever swamps of the Internet.

ZURICH — George Soros, the billionaire investor and liberal donor, sat in his hotel suite by Lake Zurich this week, lamenting the turn much of the world has taken in recent years: “Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.” His favored presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, lost to President Trump, whose “America First” platform runs counter to the globalism Soros embraces. Trump, he said, “is willing to destroy the world.” The European Union, which Soros once hoped would be so successful that he could end his charitable work in the region, is contending with the impending loss of Britain and a rise of anti-immigrant sentiment. And Soros himself has emerged as a political target in elections from Hungary to California, where his donations have been used as a cudgel against the causes he supports. The 87-year-old Holocaust survivor, who has poured much of his fortune into promoting liberal values around the globe, is now confronting a wave of nationalist sentiment washing against issues he has championed. But rather than recede from public life in his twilight years, Soros has decided to push even harder for his agenda, he told The Washington Post in a rare interview. “The bigger the danger, the bigger the threat, the more I feel engaged to confront it,” Soros said Thursday. Wearing an open-collar­ shirt, he spoke animatedly for an hour, sitting at a table in his suite after an appearance at a Human Rights Watch conference. “So in that sense, yes, I redouble my efforts.” Confronting brick walls Soros’s willingness to remain in the fray comes as he faces renewed vilification from a wide-ranging group of opponents that includes actress Roseanne Barr and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin. He has been accused of being an all-powerful puppet master, a Nazi sympathizer and the person controlling the Democratic Party. He acknowledges that the attacks can blunt his impact. “It makes it very difficult for me to speak effectively because it can be taken out of context and used against me,” Soros said. For all the billions of dollars at his disposal, Soros is also being forced to reckon with limits on his political influence in the United States. He acknowledged that he did not see Trump’s election coming. “Apparently, I was living in my own bubble,” he said. Soros, who plans to spend at least $15 million in 2018 races, has already faced some setbacks this cycle. His bid to replace several district attorneys in California with challengers seeking changes to the criminal justice system was largely unsuccessful in Tuesday’s elections. “We ran into a brick wall in California,” he said. Soros said he is certain in his assessment of Trump, whom he describes as a “narcissist” who “considers himself all-powerful.” But he does not appear settled on the strategy to defeat him. Soros said he disapproves of a campaign by fellow liberal billionaire Tom Steyer to push to impeach the president, saying he would only support such an effort if Democrats retake Congress this year and gain Republican support. Soros, who said he wants to avoid dividing the party, also refused to pick favorites among the emerging crop of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders. But there is one prospective candidate he said he hopes does not get the nod: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. He blames Gillibrand for pushing the resignation of former senator Al Franken “whom I admire,” Soros said, “in order to improve her chances.” Franken (Minn.) resigned in January after a number of women alleged that he touched them inappropriately. Gillibrand was a leading voice urging her fellow Democrat to quit. She declined to comment. Earlier this year, Patrick Gaspard, the former Obama White House political director who now runs Soros’s Open Society Foundations, said he asked the billionaire how he viewed the organization’s role at a time when so much of Soros’s work is under assault. “This is the moment we were built for,” Soros responded, according to Gaspard. The Hungarian-born Soros, who became one of the world’s wealthiest people by managing hedge funds and betting on currency changes, has given away billions of dollars to groups promoting human rights, democracy and liberal causes. His New York-based Open Society Foundations now spends $940 million a year in 100 countries, promoting values such as free speech and free elections, according to the group. In the United States, the Open Society spends $150 million a year financing groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood. For a period of time, Soros was the largest private donor in Russia, funding initiatives such as an anti-torture program, according to the foundation. Two years ago, Putin’s government effectively banned Soros’s group from distributing funds in the country, calling it “undesirable” and “a threat to the fundamentals of the constitutional system.” Last week, Putin suggested that Soros’s spending around the world resembles the kind of political interference that U.S. intelligence officials blame on Russia. “He intervenes in things all over the world,” Putin told Austrian television. “But the State Department will tell you that it has nothing to do with that, that this is the personal business of Mr. Soros.” Elsewhere in Europe, Soros has also come under attack. This year, Viktor Orban, the right-wing prime minister of Hungary, won reelection after charging that Soros wanted to flood Europe with Muslim immigrants. Orban said one of his first efforts would be to pass a “Stop Soros” bill, aimed at cracking down on organizations he views as countering his agenda. “I’m painfully aware that they are against the ideas that I stand for,” Soros said of his critics around the world. 2016 and Trump In the United States, Soros was initially seen as an ally by Republicans who shared his opposition to communist dictators. He made modest donations to support the GOP in the 1980s and 1990s, according to campaign finance reports. But he turned decisively against Republicans after President George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 on the basis of faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction. Since then, his political spending — a fraction of the money he gives away every year — has made him one of the Democratic Party’s most reliable and generous donors. In 2016, he poured at least $25 million into mobilizing Democratic voters in an effort to bolster Clinton and other candidates on the left, a Soros spokesman said. In the final days of the White House race, Trump spoke in his closing television ad about sending a tough message to “global special interests” who wanted to control Washington, as images of Soros and other financial leaders who are Jewish flashed on the screen amid footage of Clinton. Soros, who describes himself as an agnostic Jew, said he considered the ad “a coded anti-Semitic message.” On Election Day, Soros gathered with friends to watch returns in his Fifth Avenue duplex, overlooking the reservoir of New York’s Central Park. As the returns came in, “the party turned into a wake,” said Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, who was one of the guests. Soros said he spent months studying what went wrong in the election. He said he concluded that while Clinton would have made a “very good president,” she was not a good campaigner. “She was too much like a schoolmarm,” Soros said. “Talking down to people . . . instead of listening to them.” But he said he also diagnosed a larger problem: the increasing ease with which people’s opinions can be manipulated. “It is so much easier to destroy trust than to build it up,” Soros said. Soros has known Trump for years. Decades ago, the two men dined together several times at the Berkshire estate of a mutual friend, Soros said. “I had no idea he had political ambitions, but I didn’t like his behavior as a businessman,” he said. At one point, he said, Trump asked him to be the lead tenant in a new office building he was developing in New York City. “Name your price,” Trump said, according to Soros. Soros said he declined because he was concerned that being so closely associated with the developer, whose Atlantic City casinos were financially troubled at the time, would hurt “my reputation.” The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Soros said that if Democrats win in a “landslide” and forge a bipartisan relationship with moderate Republicans, as he expects, then he would favor impeaching Trump “because he is endangering the United States and the world.” But even then, there would be a cost, he said: “This would make [Vice President] Pence the president, who is much more competent in representing the far right, whose views with which I disagree, than Trump himself.” Races, donations, defiance This cycle, Soros has focused his political investments on congressional races and mobilizing voters on the left. His largest donation this year has been $5 million to Win Justice, a voter-mobilization group focused on minorities, women and young voters in Florida, Michigan and Nevada. He has also continued to invest in district attorney races, saying prosecutors are “the linchpin of the judicial system” and key to his effort to reduce prison sentences. He sent $1.45 million to a group that supported civil rights attorney Larry Krasner in his successful race for Philadelphia district attorney last year. A spokesman said Krasner had never met Soros or anyone in his organization. Soros’s recent efforts in California were not so successful. Three of his candidates for district attorney in California lost their primaries, and a fourth faces a runoff. His financial support became a political issue in some of the campaigns. Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert, who defeated her challenger Tuesday, claimed that the city was “under attack” from the billionaire, “who has brought his war against law enforcement” to Sacramento. The breadth of Soros’s spending has made him a frequent target of critics on the right, who suggest he is secretly backing movements that appear to be driven by the grass roots. Former congressman Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican who is a CNN commentator, suggested on Twitter in February that Soros and other activists, rather than students, were behind a protest in the wake of a Florida high school shooting in which a gunman killed 17 people. A spokesman said Soros had no involvement with the protest. Kingston said in an interview that he was merely raising the question of whether Soros was involved. “Some names invoke an emotional outcry from the red-meat crowds, and certainly he is one of them on the right,” Kingston said. “The left has theirs. He does get that sort of sinister, that is, that kind of myth about him, that he plays in the shadows. Maybe that’s wrong.” Last month, Soros’s name went viral again when Barr tweeted that he is “a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth.” Among those who retweeted her was the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Soros, who said he used false papers at age 13 to survive the Nazi occupation of Hungary, calls such claims “a total fabrication,” adding that they “annoy me greatly.” But he is not fazed, he said. “I’m proud of my enemies,” Soros said. “When I look at the enemies I have all over the world, I must be doing something right.” michael.kranish@washpost.com	617	"[{""start"": 1721, ""end"": 1847, ""text"": ""He has been accused of being an all-powerful puppet master, a Nazi sympathizer and the person controlling the Democratic Party"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6470, ""end"": 6863, ""text"": ""In the final days of the White House race, Trump spoke in his closing television ad about sending a tough message to “global special interests” who wanted to control Washington, as images of Soros and other financial leaders who are Jewish flashed on the screen amid footage of Clinton.

Of all the conspiracy theories spun around the 87-year-old Jewish billionaire George Soros — that he is the “puppet master” of all liberals, that he owns Black Lives Matter, that he is secretly building a new world order — the most demonstrably insane may be the claim that he was a Nazi. That is: That the 14-year-old boy who had to hide from his own government during the German occupation of Hungary was a war criminal who sent his own people to gas chambers. This particular strain of anti-Soros paranoia has festered for years on far-right message boards, but it suddenly metastasized on Tuesday when it appeared in Roseanne Barr’s Twitter rant, then spread to the feeds of Donald Trump Jr. and tens of thousands beyond. Unlike other parts of Barr’s rant — namely her comparison between a black woman and an ape, since deleted and apologized for, though not before it cost her her ABC sitcom — the actress has shown no regret for writing “George Soros is a Nazi.” Trump Jr., too, has defended his decision to share the message, denying there was anything anti-Semitic about it. Alex Jones claims there is even proof of what Barr claimed — that Soros admitted to Nazi collaboration in a 1998 interview on “60 Minutes.” This is, at best, a gross distortion of an interview in which the financier reflected on how he survived as a Jewish teenager in Nazi-occupied Hungary. “I was 14 years old,” he told Steve Kroft. “It was a tremendous evil, a very personal experience of evil.” But it was an experience for which he felt no guilt, Soros added, unwittingly seeding smears that would follow him for the next 20 years. Early in the occupation, Soros worked as a courier for the local Jewish council, which Nazis set up in many occupied countries — using Jews to identify and keep tabs on other Jews. “The members of the Jewish councils faced impossible moral dilemmas,” the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum wrote. They were often unaware that the Nazis’ goal was the death of all Jews, or even believed that working with the regime might benefit their communities. One day, Soros was ordered to deliver messages to several Jewish lawyers in Budapest, according to the biography, “Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire.” The letters instructed the lawyers to report to a rabbinical school, but Soros realized they would be imprisoned upon arrival. He warned them of their danger, according to the book, and quit his job with the council after carrying out the errand. As the deportation of Jews increased, Soros was forced to hide his Jewish identity. He assumed a fake name, and his father paid a Christian government official to take the boy in as his “godson.” Soros once accompanied his Christian protector on a trip out of town, according to the book, where the official had been ordered to inventory the mansion of a Jew who had fled the country. “George walked around the grounds and spent time with [the homeowner’s] staff,” biographer Michael T. Kaufman wrote. “He collaborated with no one and he paid attention to what he understood to be his primary responsibility: making sure that no one doubted that he was [Christian]. Among his practical concerns was to make sure that no one saw him pee.” But decades later, on “60 Minutes,” Kroft interrogated Soros about the trip. “You went and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews,” the host said. “Yes,” Soros replied. “Was it difficult?” “Not at all,” Soros said. “Maybe as a child you don’t, you don’t see the connection.” “No feeling of guilt?” “No. … Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator. The property was being taken away. So I had no role in taking away that property.” In fact, Kaufman wrote in the biography, Soros would spend years in therapy “dealing with the impact that his temporary, necessary, and pragmatic denial of Jewishness at the age of fourteen had had on the development of his personality.” Not that any such nuance was included in Glenn Beck’s three-part Fox News series about George Soros in 2010: “The Puppet Master.” Soros was world-famous by the time the series aired. He had been sometimes portrayed as a hero, such as for spending billions of dollars on foundations promoting democracy in Eastern Europe. And he had been sometimes portrayed as a villain, as when he earned a fortune by speculating against the British pound in the 1990s. He had made friends and enemies in politics by spending millions to oppose former President George W. Bush — at one point comparing that administration’s war rhetoric to Nazi and Communist propaganda. But Beck turned Soros into a cartoon nightmare — using actual puppets as props as he claimed the billionaire was funding a vast web of liberal organizations and trying to “form a shadow government, using humanitarian aid as a cover.” The Fox News treatment of Soros’s childhood was bizarre. In the second episode of Beck’s series, Soros was called “the son of Orthodox Jews.” Two days later, Beck claimed “his mother was wildly anti-Semitic” — a Nazi sympathizer who had perverted her son. (According to Soros’s biography, his mother’s religious feeling were complicated. She “treated her Jewishness ambiguously and at times even contemptuously” during the occupation but also risked her own life to help a Jewish stranger escape capture.) At the time, Beck’s series was largely considered obscene and delusional, if not outright anti-Semitic. “To hold a young boy responsible for what was going on around him during the Holocaust as part of a larger effort to denigrate the man is repugnant,” the director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, wrote. “George Soros has been forthright about his childhood experiences and his family’s history, and there the matter should rest.” It did not rest. “The Puppet Master” had aired the near the dawn of the online fake news age, and Beck’s fantasies became gospel in some corners of the Internet. Someone dug up Soros’s old “60 Minutes” interview, and clips spread across YouTube, exciting Ann Coulter in 2015. Then came the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose own popularity exploded after an endorsement from Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. “He was a Nazi collaborator,” Jones told his viewers a few weeks after Election Day. “He went around and helped round up thousands of people, stole hundreds of millions of dollars, reportedly. … He got off on it. The guy is fundamentally evil.” From Alex Jones to James Woods. From James Woods to anonymous underground forums, where someone pasted George Soros’s names onto an old photo of a Nazi S.S. officer and sent it out for viral distribution. A Nazi past finally became just one more aspect in the legend of George Soros: the godlike billionaire Jew who was flooding Hungary with refugees, and infiltrating voting machines and bankrolling the Ferguson protests. “Our theory about Soros and why he’s such a bugbear, is he’s like every anti-Semite’s idea of what a Jew does,” said Brooke Binkowski, managing editor at Snopes, which has debunked many of these theories. “He’s this rich guy behind the scenes, rubbing his hands together. He’s rich and does media initiatives and dabbles in politics.” This imaginary Soros had also become Chelsea Clinton’s uncle-in-law and was attempting to overthrow the U.S. government by Tuesday, when Roseanne Barr included him in a rambling Twitter rant that she would later blame on Ambien. In the fury that greeted Barr’s comments about Valerie Jarrett during the same rant (“muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby”), her slurs against Soros passed relatively unnoticed. The president of ABC Entertainment did not mention them when she announced that Barr’s popular sitcom would be canceled because of the racist tweet. Barr said nothing about Soros when she apologized to Jarrett, and left her “Soros is a Nazi” tweet up, even after deleting “apes.” But for some, at least, it was impossible to ignore. “George Soros has become the enemy of choice for despots at home and around the world,” his son, Alexander Soros, wrote in the New York Daily News. “That means he is frequently targeted by malicious lies and wild conspiracy theories.” “Until now, I have been mostly silent on these matters because I have not wanted to add fuel to the fire by giving them further attention,” he continued. “But I find one lie so odious that I feel duty bound to address it directly.” And then he said it: what his father had done, and what he had not, as a scared Jewish boy in a land ruled by Nazis. “Roseanne Barr’s claims are not just an insult to my father,” the younger Soros concluded, “but all those who endured the Holocaust.” Read more: ABC cancels ‘Roseanne’ after its star, Roseanne Barr, went on a vitriolic and racist Twitter rant Once-fringe Soros conspiracy theory takes center stage in Hungarian election Valerie Jarrett on Roseanne Barr’s racist insult: ‘Tone starts at the top.’ One Roseanne Barr tweet got her TV show canceled.

There was no hubbub after Lou Dobbs’s show on the Fox Business Network last Thursday night. The media world was riveted to the mail bombs sent by a then-unknown criminal who had it out for Democratic politicians and CNN. That drama had overtaken the migrant caravan proceeding northward toward the U.S. border with Mexico. On “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” however, the caravan merited a close look. So host Dobbs chatted with Chris Farrell, director of research and investigation for conservative group Judicial Watch, about his firsthand observations on the story. Summing up the caravan, Farrell called it “overwhelmingly male”; he said there were “certainly criminal elements rolled into the caravan”; he called it a “sophisticated operation” and identified “criminal involvement on the part of these leftist groups”; and he said, “A lot of these folks also have affiliates or are getting money from the Soros-occupied State Department and that is a great, great concern. We need to start cutting money — start cutting money there.” Life went on. On Saturday evening, Talking Points Memo’s Josh Marshall caught a re-airing of the Dobbs-Farrell discussion and he tweeted: The world had changed between the two airings. On Saturday morning, a gunman opened fire on a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 people. Robert Bowers, described by the New York Times as an “isolated, awkward man who lived alone and struggled with basic human interactions,” was accused of the killings. What had motivated the shooter? Also in the words of the Times: “Mr. Bowers frequently reposted anti-Semitic content that alleged Jews control the nation. On a doctored image of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the gate read: ‘Lies Make Money.’ Another post said: ‘Open you Eyes! It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!’ ” In light of this atrocity, conspiracy theories about George Soros, the 88-year-old billionaire and philanthropist, attracted new attention. As noted by The Post’s Joel Achenbach, the idea that Soros was somehow funding the caravan stretches back to an separate migrant movement in March. Soros was the recipient of a mail bomb allegedly sent by Cesar Sayoc, the Trump supporter who was charged with also sending devices to a number of Democratic politicians and CNN. After Marshall’s tweet touched off a social media furor, Fox News on Sunday came forth with action. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight,” said Gary Schreier, Fox Business Network’s senior vice president of programming in a statement. “This episode was a repeat which has now been pulled from all future airings.” Nor would Farrell be invited for further guest appearances on Fox Business Network or Fox News. Missing from the statement was any explanation of just what was worthy of the network’s condemnation. Had Schreier gone into such detail, he’d likely have to disqualify other pundits from returning to the network’s air. The exile for Farrell echoes the treatment of a Fox Business guest who in May alleged on air that torture had “worked” on John McCain in Vietnam and was disqualified from future punditry on Fox.  In June, Fox News contributor David Bossie was suspended for telling a black Democratic strategist, “You’re out of your cotton-picking mind.” Fox News condemned the remarks, and Bossie apologized. And in September, Fox News fired contributor Kevin Johnson after he used Twitter to call Brett M. Kavanaugh’s sexual assault accusers “lying skanks.” What those examples have in common is outrage immediately after the remarks. In that respect, they differ from the incident with Farrell, who made little or no waves with his “Soros-occupied State Department” remark when it aired last Thursday night. “Honestly, this rhetoric was pretty normal for Fox’s coverage of George Soros. It is the type of thing they’ve been doing and saying for years,” says Matthew Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a group that tracks Fox News material. (Gertz is married to a writer in The Post’s Opinions section). “The difference, I think … is the timing — the fact that they got caught with this rhetoric coming in the wake of an anti-Semitic massacre.” Folks at Media Matters know the ins and outs of Fox News and Soros. In 2010, Soros gave the outfit $1 million. At the time, Soros spoke of his hopes that the donation would “more widely publicize the challenge Fox News poses to civil and informed discourse in our democracy.” Prescient. Though Soros hasn’t donated to Media Matters since then, Fox News still commonly refers to Media Matters in the same breath as Soros. As for the Dobbs-Farrell episode, it raises an unanswerable but nonetheless pressing question: How much similarly offensive stuff does Fox News/Fox Business spew into the homes of its viewers, with little or no pushback from anyone? How many more calamities do we need to appreciate the horror of this network?

Republicans pressed ahead in casting financier George Soros as a threat, shrugging off criticism that the attacks are anti-Semitic, days after a fervent supporter of President Trump was charged with sending a mail bomb to Soros’s home and a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The National Republican Congressional Committee continued airing an ad Monday criticizing a Minnesota Democratic candidate and Iraq War veteran over his job at a foundation funded in part by Soros. The Michigan Republican Party promoted a digital ad depicting Soros among forces “looking to rig Michigan’s elections.” On Friday, hours before the arrest and charges in the mail bomb case, the GOP nominee for Florida governor described what he called the threat posed by “Soros-backed activists.” The attacks on the 88-year-old Soros, a multibillionaire who has underwritten left-leaning civic groups and political campaigns in the United States and abroad, come amid a larger effort by Republicans to portray protests on the political left as “mob” tactics as they seek to rouse base voters. But the attempted bombing of Soros and other prominent Democrats, and Saturday’s synagogue attack, have placed references to Soros in a darker light. The Anti-Defamation League, before last week’s violence, connected an increasing number of mentions by mainstream conservative politicians and groups to a spate of far-right conspiracy theories involving Soros. “Even if unintentional, politicians and pundits repeating these unsubstantiated conspiracies essentially validate the same hateful myths propagated by anti-Semites,” the group said. “A person who promotes a Soros conspiracy theory may not intend to promulgate anti-Semitism. But Soros’ Jewish identity is so well-known that in many cases it is hard not to infer that meaning.” Trump and the GOP have been in lockstep on the attacks. “The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love! #Troublemakers,” Trump tweeted Oct. 5. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who is hoping to lead the House next year, tweeted early last week about Soros and two other Democratic megadonors of Jewish descent: Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. “We cannot allow Soros, Steyer and Bloomberg to BUY this election!” McCarthy tweeted. McCarthy deleted the tweet last week. Asked for an explanation, his spokesman Matt Sparks pointed to a statement released last week after the attempted bombing but before the shooting: “Understanding the particular sensitivity of the past 24 hours in the political climate today that has led to specific threats on both sides of the aisle, we will redouble our focus on our agenda of results.” The conservative group Judicial Watch has been among Soros’s most persistent critics. Its director of investigations and research, Chris Farrell, blamed a migrant caravan that is moving from Central America toward the U.S. border on a “Soros-occupied State Department” during a Fox Business Network interview Thursday. The network subsequently denounced the comment and said Farrell would no longer appear on Fox. Judicial Watch was a key source for a video that aired in May on the federally funded TV Martí, which broadcasts to Cuba, attacking Soros as a “multimillionaire Jew” and a “nonbelieving Jew of flexible morals.” The video, which Mother Jones reported Friday, is now under investigation by the U.S. Agency for Global Media after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) blasted the segment as “taxpayer-funded anti-Semitism” and demanded answers. The Minnesota ad counts Soros among several figures who would “own” Democratic House candidate Dan Feehan, a decorated Army veteran who is a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a liberal think tank. That group is supported by Soros’s main philanthropic vehicle, the Open Society Foundations. An earlier ad in the race was even more explicit, casting Soros as a shadowy figure peering over Feehan’s shoulder — alongside NFL quarterback turned civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick and far-left “Antifa” protesters. Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the NRCC chairman, defended that ad in a Sunday interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while noting that he had no control over the NRCC’s independent expenditure arm that created the spot and paid to air it. “That ad is factual, and it also has nothing to do with calling for violence,” Stivers said. Ron DeSantis, running for Florida governor, invoked Soros while attacking his Democratic opponent, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, at a church during a Friday campaign event. “He would be seeding into our state government, you know, Soros-backed activists,” DeSantis said of Gillum, prompting some in the crowd to jeer, according to a video posted to YouTube and first reported by the Daily Beast. On Monday, after the bomb attempt and the synagogue shooting, the Michigan Republican Party tweeted an ad attacking a Democratic candidate for secretary of state for being “funded by liberal out-of-state donors, far-left special interest groups and coastal billionaires all looking to rig Michigan’s elections.” The ad depicts Soros, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). None of those three figures is listed as donating to the candidate, Jocelyn Benson. Benson was supported in a 2010 run for the same office by the Secretaries of State Project, a group that received backing from Soros’s foundation. A successor group, the iVote Fund, is backing Benson this year. Sarah Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Republican Party, said that the video was produced and initially published before the recent attacks and that Soros’s depiction has “nothing to do with his religion and everything to do with him financing Democrat candidates for office in Michigan.” “We used Mr. Soros as an example because he is a well-known donor to liberal candidates and causes,” she said, adding, “We have not ever and would not ever use someone’s religion as a reason to support or oppose them.” Benson spokeswoman Liz Boyd called the ad a sign of desperation: “They are facing head winds going into Election Day with a candidate who actually wants to make it harder to vote and who believes dark money is here to stay. That stands in sharp contrast to Jocelyn Benson, who actually wants to improve the lives of Michigan citizens, including making it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” While the NRCC’s Soros ad remains up in Minnesota, other Republican groups have continued running sharp-edged spots that rely on other ways to motivate GOP voters. In the same race, for instance, the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) super PAC is airing an ad highlighting the caravan, claiming that it is “full of gang members and criminals.” Other ads released by the group in the past week tie candidates to the “liberal mob” and the “radical resistance” with images of rampaging protesters, not to mention a whole spate of spots that continue a long-running effort to target House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). A spokeswoman for the CLF, Courtney Alexander, declined to comment on whether the group would change its messaging in light of last week’s events. She said the group is not featuring Soros in any of its current political messaging. Some Republicans have broached the issue of political violence with a softer touch. Two survivors of the June 2017 shooting in which a politically motivated gunman targeted Republican lawmakers at a baseball field near Washington are highlighting their experience in TV ads. “I never thought that my friends and I would have to dodge bullets from somebody who just disagreed with us politically,” Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) says in one ad. “Standing for your values is important, but it must be done with civility,” Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) says in another. mike.debonis@washpost.com	615	"[{""start"": 2355, ""end"": 2512, ""text"": ""Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. “We cannot allow Soros, Steyer and Bloomberg to BUY this election!” McCarthy tweeted.

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) is coming under criticism for falsely claiming in an interview that billionaire philanthropist George Soros, known for his funding of liberal and pro-democracy groups, “helped take the property” owned by fellow Jews. Patrick Gaspard, president of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, sent a letter to Gohmert on Thursday afternoon asking him to apologize for the “disturbing and false anti-Semitic slur.” In an interview Thursday morning with Fox Business Network’s Stuart Varney, Gohmert spoke about Google’s plans to build a censored search engine in China. At one point in the interview, Gohmert pivoted from discussing the tech giant to making accusations against Soros, who is frequently the subject of conspiracy theories and in October was among the prominent critics of President Trump to whom a Florida man allegedly mailed pipe bombs. “You mention Orwell. It also reminds me of another George — George Soros — you know, because Google is born in a free country, and then they go over and oppress others — help oppress — in another country,” Gohmert told Varney. “George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn’t know it from the damage he’s inflicted on Israel, and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned. It’s the same kind of thing.” George Orwell was a British author. Varney moved on without addressing Gohmert’s statements. He later distanced himself and the network from Gohmert’s views, the Daily Beast reported. “Congressman Louie Gohmert for some reason went out of his way to bring up George Soros and made unsubstantiated and false allegations against him. I want to make clear those views are not shared by me, this program or anyone at Fox Business,” Varney said. Gohmert on Thursday was referencing a false claim that Soros helped the Nazis confiscate property from Jews during World War II. Soros has said he used false papers to survive the Nazi occupation when he was 13 years old living in Hungary. The allegation that he is a Nazi who turned in fellow Jews and stole their wealth is “a total fabrication,” Soros told The Washington Post earlier this year, saying such charges “annoy me greatly.” On Thursday afternoon, Gohmert doubled down on his remarks, which he argued were “not anti-Semitic” but rather “pro-Jewish.” “Soros himself admitted in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft on December 20, 1998, that he had no regrets whatsoever about assisting the Nazis in confiscating property from the Jewish people during the Holocaust,” Gohmert said in a statement released by his office. “That is a fact.” Yet a transcript of the “60 Minutes” interview published by the fact-checking website Snopes shows that, after initially appearing to agree with Kroft that he “helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews,” Soros later clarified that he “was only a spectator.” “I had no role in taking away that property,” Soros said. “So I had no sense of guilt.” Gohmert also on Thursday cited a “statement that the Israeli government made last year that anti-Soros statements are not anti-Semitic.” But while the Israeli Foreign Ministry statement was sharply critical of Soros, it did not declare that all criticism of Soros was not anti-Semitic. Gaspard, the president of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, said in his letter to Gohmert on Thursday that “this conduct is beneath your office.” “Just to reiterate the facts: George Soros escaped the Nazis as a 14-year-old boy, and he has spent most of his life supporting efforts to ensure that such terrifying authoritarianism never takes root again,” Gaspard said. “He did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round up people. He did not confiscate anybody’s property.” He added that it was “the height of irresponsibility” for Gohmert to make such remarks just weeks after the mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue and the pipe bomb targeting Soros. “You are not entitled to misrepresent his and his family’s courage during such a terrifying and difficult period in our history,” Gaspard said. Soros has been the subject of a range of unfounded conspiracy theories over the years, including one that he recently funded a caravan of Central American migrants making its way through Mexico toward the U.S. southern border. Trump suggested last month that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if Soros was funding the group. Some of those conspiracy theories have made their way into U.S. government-funded broadcasts. The head of a U.S. government agency apologized last month for the airing of a program that called Soros a “nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals,” claimed that he was involved in “clandestine operations that led to the dismantling of the Soviet Union” and described him as “the architect of the financial collapse of 2008.” The Spanish-language report was produced by Radio and Television Martí, which is aimed at audiences in Cuba. Gohmert has previously taken aim at Soros, telling host Fox Business host Lou Dobbs in October that it was “not anti-Semitic” to criticize the liberal megadonor. felicia.sonmez@washpost.com	613	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 427, ""text"": ""uie Gohmert (R-Tex.) is coming under criticism for falsely claiming in an interview that billionaire philanthropist George Soros, known for his funding of liberal and pro-democracy groups, “helped take the property” owned by fellow Jews.

"Several years ago, a psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital in New York began to notice a pattern among people seeking treatment: Dozens believed that their lives were being constantly filmed and broadcast, as though they were the stars of their own versions of “The Truman Show.” That film, in fact, became the name for this particular, and particularly modern, affliction. The Truman Show Delusion. The Bellevue psychiatrist, Joel Gold, published research about the syndrome with his brother, Ian Gold, seeking to determine how culture and mental illness overlapped. There was no suggestion that the movie itself made people delusional but, rather, that the movie informed the shape of the delusion. It was, if you will, a framework on which the patient’s mental illness could be hung. It’s not clear that either Cesar Sayoc, who allegedly mailed explosive devices to a number of Democratic politicians and to CNN last week, or Robert D. Bowers, who allegedly killed 11 people at a synagogue on Saturday, suffered from mental illness. But there’s certainly evidence that dominant political rhetoric — including rhetoric promoted by President Trump — may have served as a similar framework for their dangerous, violent actions. Bowers was apparently an active user of the social-networking site Gab, a site created in part to offer a home to those barred from other platforms because of their extreme views. A user identified as Robert Bowers posted a message shortly before the attack at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. In the message, the writer took issue with a Jewish refugee organization called the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps resettle refugees in the United States. “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” the message read. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” There is an idea among anti-Semitic groups that there’s a Jewish conspiracy to undercut white populations with nonwhite immigrants. During the torchlight march by white nationalists in Charlottesville, last year, the chanted slogan “Jews will not replace us” seemed to get at that notion. But in the current political dialogue, there’s an undercurrent to the idea that prominent Jewish people are supporting dangerous immigrants. Trump has repeatedly sought to focus attention on a group of migrants traveling through Mexico, hinting darkly that the caravan is riddled with criminals and terrorists. It’s part and parcel of his overall rhetoric on certain groups of immigrants and refugees. It was explicit in his campaign: Those crossing the U.S.-Mexican border are criminals, by default, and those who are Muslim should be barred entirely. To disparage the migrants, Trump retweeted a video showing people purported to be members of the caravan being handed money, a video that had previously been tweeted by his ally Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.). Gaetz’s tweet questioned the origin of the money, wondering if it came from U.S. organizations — or from billionaire George Soros, a frequent target of conservatives for his political spending and of anti-Semites for his religion. Trump has looped Soros into his own conspiracies, too. When Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court was under consideration, Trump suggested that those protesting his appointment were being paid by the billionaire. Trump has never implied that Soros or other prominent Jewish Americans are funding refugees to come to the United States and replace white Americans. But the president’s comments about migration are helping to elevate skepticism and fear about immigrants and refugees in the public perception, especially as they’re echoed in the media and among his supporters. On the Fox Business network, hours after Bowers allegedly killed 11 people at that synagogue in Pittsburgh, host Lou Dobbs, long known for his anti-immigration rhetoric, interviewed a guest who insisted that the caravan was getting money indirectly from the “Soros-occupied State Department.” One of the last tweets from the Robert Bowers Gab account included a cartoon referring to “ZOG” — Zionist-occupied government. Bowers’s anti-Semitism didn’t derive from Trump; in fact, he seems to have opposed the president. The political anger of alleged mail-bomber Sayoc, though, overlapped with Trump’s rhetoric much more neatly. Consider this quote from Ronald Lowy, who served as legal counsel for Sayoc. “Had no interest in politics, was always at the nightclubs, the gyms, wherever he thought he could meet people, impress people,” Lowy told The Post about Sayoc. “And along came the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, who welcomed all extremists, all outsiders, all outliers, and he felt that somebody was finally talking to him.” Joel Gold, the Bellevue psychiatrist, described the sorts of people who were susceptible to the Truman Show Delusion. “People who choose to be the center of attention, have concerns about social standing, or who may fear being in [the] public eye or seek it out, may be more drawn to identify with this delusion,” Gold wrote. “I don’t think people are making it up or choosing it.” A van and social media accounts believed to belong to Sayoc were peppered with both fringe and mainstream political rhetoric. There were mentions of chemtrails (a conspiracy theory holding that planes spread mind-altering chemicals) and mentions of Republican candidates in Florida’s elections. Sayoc embraced run-of-the-mill conspiracy theories about the administration of Barack Obama and more bizarre ones, such as speculating that Soros helped fake the mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Fla., in February. He at one point posted Soros’s home address on Twitter; that home was one of the targets to receive a bomb in the mail. Mostly, though, the consistent theme is Trump. Trump appears on Sayoc's van repeatedly. Incorrect assertions from Trump are included among the phrases plastered on the vehicle's windows. Those who were targeted with bombs were those with whom Trump had taken issue: CNN, former intelligence officials, Democratic leaders and politicians, actor Robert DeNiro. Sayoc may have been unstable before Trump, but Trump clearly offered him a political lattice from which to build outward. We noted last week that the bombs being sent to political leaders had drawn the media's attention away from that caravan — a shift that frustrated Trump. (The one network that continued to discuss the caravan over the mail bombs? Fox Business.) Trump was explicit about the reason for his frustration. ""Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows — news not talking politics,” he complained on Twitter. He'd previously said that the caravan should be a reason for people to vote against Democrats. Suddenly, people wanted to talk about something else, right as the midterms were looming. That’s the critical context for Trump. His rhetoric on immigration and refugees may be deeply felt, but he’s amplifying those concerns now for the same reason that he did in 2015 and 2016: electoral politics. The caravan is far from the border and winnowing in size, but Trump wants to talk about it because he understands the powerful fear that the idea of people headed to the border can engender. Trump’s rhetoric hasn’t been only about the danger of immigrants, of course. He has also insisted that the choice between the parties is “jobs” or “mobs” — with Democrats representing the latter in the form of angry protesters. (Some, remember, paid by Soros.) In an audio clip obtained by CNN, Trump, without offering any evidence, warned that a Republican loss in November could lead to violence by the left. A central question about the attempted bombings and the synagogue shooting is: Why now? Is it a coincidence that both of those acts happened at this moment? Or was the bomber, allegedly Sayoc, reacting in part to the assertion that Democrats were being violent? Was the synagogue shooter, allegedly Bowers, reacting to the increased urgency fomented by Trump and his allies about the risk of migrants coming to the United States? Let’s say that both the attempted mail bombings and the synagogue shooting were carried out by people who held the precise opinions expressed by Sayoc and by that Gab account. Let’s say, further, that the perpetrators of those acts were in fact mentally ill. Again, in the Truman Show Delusion, it’s not suggested that the movie made people delusional, but that it gave people a new conduit for their existing delusions. If we extend that idea, one can and should note that mental illness played a role in the attacks but that the framework of the existing political rhetoric may have pointed toward particular targets. But we don’t need that overlay of mental illness. The prevalence of this rhetoric means it serves as a framework for a lot of political discussion, not just at the extremes. So we have to note why that rhetoric exists: because Trump and his allies think that concern about migrants and about Democratic violence will help them win elections, whether or not they think those concerns are valid."	612	"[{""start"": 2895, ""end"": 3125, ""text"": ""Gaetz’s tweet questioned the origin of the money, wondering if it came from U.S. organizations — or from billionaire George Soros, a frequent target of conservatives for his political spending and of anti-Semites for his religion."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3362, ""end"": 3511, ""text"": ""Trump has never implied that Soros or other prominent Jewish Americans are funding refugees to come to the United States and replace white Americans."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5436, ""end"": 5776, ""text"": "".

"Glenn Beck left Fox News in 2011. He and his conspiracy theories, however, haven’t taken permanent leave from the No. 1 cable news channel. Last month, for instance, he joined fellow fantasist Sean Hannity for a chat about migrants heading through Mexico toward the U.S. border. “The problem is actually coming from Chicago,” Beck told Hannity during an April 10 broadcast. “There is a group, a family that has a United Methodist Church, they are preachers, they are the ones that started the sanctuary city. They are directly getting money from George Soros and others.” Another night on Fox News, another baseless slam against Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and funder of Democratic politicians. Was Soros really behind the migrant movement? “Absolutely not — not on any level whatsoever,” Patrick Gaspard, president of the Open Society Foundations, Soros’ philanthropic agency, tells the Erik Wemple Blog in an interview. Over the past month, Gaspard has attempted to petition Fox News for a correction. “How many times do these false statements need to be aired before you take action?” asked Gaspard in an April 11 letter. Soros is a Hungarian-born Jewish philanthropist who survived the Nazi occupation of 1944-45 and, by the time he fled to England in 1947, had lived under both Nazi and communist rule, as Nadine Epstein notes in a short biography. After his emigration to the United States in 1956, he made a bundle in finance, then focused that wealth on philanthropy, funding scholarships for black South African university students and Eastern European dissidents beginning in 1979. A profile in the New York Times Magazine notes that after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Soros “poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the former Soviet-bloc countries to promote civil society and liberal democracy. It was a one-man Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, a private initiative without historical precedent. It was also a gamble that a part of the world that had mostly known tyranny would embrace ideas like government accountability and ethnic tolerance.” Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF) dishes out nearly $1 billion per year to organizations around the world that work on health care, education, government accountability and free elections, among others. Soros’ identification with partisan U.S. politics took root during the administration of President George W. Bush, whose war on terror terrified Soros with its fervor. “I really became engaged in domestic politics in 2004, because I felt that the single most important thing I could do to make the world a better place is to help get President Bush out of the White House,” said Soros, during a 2006 interview with Fox News. “And, unfortunately, events since then have borne me out.” Among the beneficiaries of Soros’ largesse has been Media Matters for America, the nonprofit watchdog group that monitors the hateful and inaccurate eructations of Fox News — a big job. Fox News and its guests have responded with pettiness, exaggeration and dishonesty. Typical of the reigning Fox News attitude toward Soros was a quip last week by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who referred to him as a “socialist activist,” even though he made his fortune off of capitalism and started his philanthropic career fighting communism. No one, however, outdoes Hannity, who presides over the most bilious rhetoric about the mighty Soros. “And according now tonight to foxnews.com, many protests like the one you saw . . . They are being organized, funded, actually, shockingly, by George Soros and a group that he is backing,"" said Hannity last October. ""He’s an extremely wealthy liberal billionaire who wants to take away your Second Amendment rights and he has a different version of what America should be, obviously, oh, a global world. I believe in the United States of America.” Following Beck’s April comments on “Hannity,” Gaspard sent his concerns to Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott. “Neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society pay people to migrate to the United States,” wrote Gaspard. “The only group Glenn Beck named was CASA, an organization that the Open Society Foundations has never funded. Perhaps he’s referring to Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which we do not nor have we ever funded. We do actually support the historic U.S. commitment — upheld by presidents of both political parties — to welcoming people fleeing oppression and violence in their homelands. Maybe FOX News’ journalists could do some accurate and responsible reporting on why people feel the need to flee those Central American countries?” Gaspard wanted to hear what steps Fox News would take to ensure that Beck-style inaccuracies stopped. No such steps emerged in Fox News’s April 23 reply, which came from Meade Cooper, the executive vice president of prime-time programming, and consisted of four sentences: “Thank you for your letter of April 11, 2019, to our Chief Executive Officer, Suzanne Scott. We appreciate the information you have shared with us about Mr. Soros and the Open Society Foundations. As you know, Mr. Hannity’s program features guest commentators who hold a wide array of opinions. We welcome your feedback or criticisms of their views, and we will respectfully take your comments into consideration.” That response pretty well encapsulates the farce of the so-called opinion hosts on Fox News. They operate under a conceit established ages ago at newspapers, in which editorialists and news reporters worked in separate spheres. Except that Fox News has corrupted the split by empowering their opinion people to operate free of facts, to equate conspiracy theories with points of view. Which is to say there is no “view” or “opinion” about whether Soros funded the caravans. As for Cooper’s reply to his concerns, Gaspard says it’s “barely above the level of a form letter.” “Regrettably, Fox News has not responded as one would expect a legitimate news organization or a legitimate business to respond,” says Gaspard. In a reply to Cooper, Gaspard wrote, “Your letter to me regarding Glenn Beck’s false and slanderous comments about George Soros is both nonresponsive and untruthful. Sean Hannity’s guests do not promote differing points of views and Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network generally push out offensive content about George Soros without any rebuttals or fact checking.” Gaspard is seeking a meeting with Fox News principals, though he has gotten no indication that the request will be granted. The network’s curt and unaccountable response to Gaspard speaks to Hannity’s power. In recent years, as Hannity has harnessed the Trump demographic with his sycophantic monologues, the fast-talking host has faced no workplace consequences. Sharing a lawyer with the president of the United States? No problem. Flying a vice presidential candidate to meet with Trump? No problem. Providing frequent advice to a presidential candidate? No problem. Inviting a guest commentator to smear a liberal billionaire on national television? Apparently no problem. There’s an element of muscle memory to the hateful rhetoric. In fall 2010, Beck famously rolled out his critique of the philanthropist, calling him a “puppet master” and tarring him with a number of anti-Semitic stereotypes. “This is George Soros’s money, handpicking secretary of states so they have them in his pocket,” he said during an October 2010 program. On his radio program, Beck tried another claim that has been clearly debunked: “Here’s a Jewish boy helping send the Jews to the death camps.” The Anti-Defamation League called the remarks “offensive” and “horrific.” With that context in mind, consider this: On a ho-hum night in October 2018, guest Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch appeared with Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Network. Referring to the caravan of migrants then pushing northward, Farrell said, “A lot of these folks also have affiliates or are getting money from the Soros-occupied State Department and that is a great, great concern. We need to start cutting money — start cutting money there.” Moneyed Jewish man controls the government — a poorly disguised bit of anti-Semitism. When those comments first aired on Oct. 25, they stirred little notice. Two days later, a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The accused killer, as it turned out, had a specific, conspiratorial gripe: “Mr. Bowers frequently reposted anti-Semitic content that alleged Jews control the nation,” wrote the New York Times about the alleged gunman’s social media postings. “On a doctored image of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the gate read: ‘Lies Make Money.’ Another post said: ‘Open you Eyes! It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!’” The Dobbs show re-aired the night after the killings, and a backlash erupted. Fox News took action, declaring that Farrell wouldn’t be booked again on Fox Business Network or Fox News. “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on ‘Lou Dobbs Tonight,’ ” said Gary Schreier, Fox Business Network’s senior vice president of programming, in a statement. “This episode was a repeat which has now been pulled from all future airings.” Another quick response issued from the network in December 2018, after Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) took it upon himself to unleash a rant against Soros during a segment with Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney. “George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn’t know it from the damage he’s inflicted on Israel, and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they own,” said Gohmert, among other things. Perhaps blindsided by the riff amid talk of China trade policy, Varney let it go, but then issued a scolding later in the broadcast: “Congressman Louie Gohmert for some reason went out of his way to bring up George Soros and made unsubstantiated and false allegations against him. I want to make clear those views are not shared by me, this program or anyone at Fox Business.” So there is some precedent for Fox News’s taking action against Soros-related slander. Says Gaspard: “That was a credit to Varney, and it represented for us progress until, of course, Mr. Beck appeared on ’Hannity’ last month and doubled down on his anti-Semitism and doubled down on irresponsible conspiracy theories that are polluting our politics.” So we wondered: If Fox was willing to discontinue Farrell’s guest appearances and scold Gohmert, why not similarly correct the record from the Beck-Hannity hit job in April? Fox News declined to comment on the record for this story. Attempts to secure comment from Beck were unsuccessful. Addressing the anti-Semitic flavor of the coverage, Gaspard says that there are plenty of philanthropists who work on justice, free press, health and education — yet Soros is the one who’s always getting the hateful references on Fox News. All the negative attention, says Gaspard, begets ugliness. Last year, Soros — along with Democratic politicians and CNN — received one of the mail bombs allegedly sent by Trump fan Cesar Sayoc. “We think there’s a relationship between those kinds of threats we receive as an organization and Fox allowing distorters of the historical record, and those who are willing to traffic in anti-Semitic tropes to make these charges in a way that is not challenged whatsoever,” says Gaspard, who told CNN’s Brian Stelter last fall that Fox News had “refused” to allow his group on the air to rebut representations about Soros. What will OSF do now? “All options are on the table,” Gaspard says.

A U.S. government agency has launched an internal investigation after airing a Spanish-language program earlier this year describing George Soros as a “multimillionaire Jew” and espousing conspiracy theories about the billionaire philanthropist. The 15-minute segment was aired in May by Radio and Television Martí, which broadcasts news and other programs promoting U.S. interests to audiences in Cuba. The program calls Soros a “nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals,” claims that he was involved in “clandestine operations that led to the dismantling of the Soviet Union” and describes him as “the architect of the financial collapse of 2008.” It also makes repeated references to Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that has launched an “Expose Soros” fundraising campaign and whose director of investigations and research recently claimed without evidence that the “Soros-occupied State Department” is funding the migrant caravan making its way to the United States. John F. Lansing, CEO and director of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Radio and Television Martí’s parent office, said in a statement Monday that a probe is underway and described the video segment as “inconsistent with our professional standards and ethics.” “Those deemed responsible for this production will be immediately placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into their apparent misconduct,” Lansing said. “Disciplinary action appropriate under federal law may then be proposed, including the potential removal of those responsible, depending on the outcome of that investigation.” USAGM, formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors, oversees the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, to which Miami-based Radio and Television Martí belongs. The videos were first surfaced on Friday by the Cuban Triangle, a blog affiliated with the nonprofit Cuba Research Center, and were also reported by Mother Jones. The original videos have been taken down from the Radio and Television Martí website, but snippets are still accessible on YouTube. In an interview with The Washington Post on Monday night, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he was pleased that USAGM was taking action to discipline the employees responsible for the program. “At best, TV and Radio Martí are pretty irrelevant,” said Flake, who has long argued that the broadcaster is inefficient and a waste of federal dollars. But “when you have an agenda like this, basically to smear George Soros and provide a platform for anti-Semitic views, to be paid for by the U.S. taxpayer,” then things have reached a new and “pernicious” level, he said. Soros’s Open Society Institute also sent a letter on Monday to USAGM and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting in which it denounced the broadcast as a “flagrant and crude propaganda television program,” disputed its claims and called for the matter to be investigated. In an initial statement to Mother Jones on Friday, Office of Cuba Broadcasting Director Tomás Regalado acknowledged that the anti-Soros program “did not have the required balance,” although he defended Judicial Watch as “a good source.” Regalado, who was previously mayor of Miami, also noted that he became director of the office after the program had already aired. Flake then drew attention to the program on Saturday with a tweet in which he called it “taxpayer-funded anti-semitism.” He followed up with a letter to Lansing earlier Monday calling for an investigation into how the program came to be produced. “At a time when hate-filled rhetoric is having a devastating impact inside the United States, it is irresponsible for any agency of the federal government to perpetuate unfounded conspiracy theories that far from supporting U.S. foreign policy goals, work against them,” Flake wrote. Even though the program aired earlier this year, the reports of its airing come one week after Soros was among a group of prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump who were targeted by mail bombs allegedly sent by a Florida man. Fears of anti-Semitism and political violence in the United States have also been on the rise in the wake of Saturday’s mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Eleven people were killed and six wounded in the massacre, which was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Radio Martí began broadcasts to Cuba in 1985; TV Martí followed suit five years later. Critics argue that the broadcasts, which are largely blocked by Cuba’s government, are of questionable quality and have had a negligible effect on Cuban society, although proponents maintain that they advance U.S. interests and provide a useful alternative to the island’s state-run media. Regalado was appointed director of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting in June, after a period of turmoil in the office. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that Regalado had succeeded former interim director André Mendes. Mendes had left the office in March, two months before the Soros program aired. felicia.sonmez@washpost.com	610	"[{""start"": 7, ""end"": 244, ""text"": ""nment agency has launched an internal investigation after airing a Spanish-language program earlier this year describing George Soros as a “multimillionaire Jew” and espousing conspiracy theories about the billionaire philanthropist"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 246, ""end"": 403, ""text"": ""The 15-minute segment was aired in May by Radio and Television Martí, which broadcasts news and other programs promoting U.S. interests to audiences in Cuba."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 404, ""end"": 645, ""text"": ""The program calls Soros a “nonpracticing Jew of flexible morals,” claims that he was involved in “clandestine operations that led to the dismantling of the Soviet Union” and describes him as “the architect of the financial collapse of 2008."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 646, ""end"": 979, ""text"": ""It also makes repeated references to Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that has launched an “Expose Soros” fundraising campaign and whose director of investigations and research recently claimed without evidence that the “Soros-occupied State Department” is funding the migrant caravan making its way to the United States"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1258, ""end"": 1599, ""text"": ""e deemed responsible for this production will be immediately placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into their apparent misconduct,” Lansing said. “Disciplinary action appropriate under federal law may then be proposed, including the potential removal of those responsible, depending on the outcome of that investigation"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1763, ""end"": 1924, ""text"": ""The videos were first surfaced on Friday by the Cuban Triangle, a blog affiliated with the nonprofit Cuba Research Center, and were also reported by Mother Jones"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1926, ""end"": 2056, ""text"": ""The original videos have been taken down from the Radio and Television Martí website, but snippets are still accessible on YouTube"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2058, ""end"": 2246, ""text"": ""In an interview with The Washington Post on Monday night, Sen.
