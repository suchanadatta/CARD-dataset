Starting immediately, the federal government is making it harder for nursing homes to get top grades on a public report card, in part by increasing scrutiny of the facilities’ use of anti-psychotic drugs and raising the bar on an array of quality measures. The grades — in the form of one- to five-star ratings — are part of Nursing Home Compare, a government Web site to help consumers evaluate nursing homes. While the star ratings, which debuted in December 2008, are lauded as an important tool, critics say they rely too heavily on self-reported data and allow a majority of homes to score high ratings. The Web site rates more than 15,000 nursing homes in three broad categories: government inspections, quality measures and staffing levels. An overall score is a fourth category. The system has come under recent criticism because of complaints that some highly rated nursing homes have numerous problems and face fines and other enforcement actions. The federal government said Thursday it would require nursing homes to do more to get high scores. Among the better-known measures that go into quality scores are the percentages of residents who develop bedsores or are injured in falls. The scores will now count the percentage of residents given anti-psychotic drugs, reflecting concern that too many are unnecessarily drugged to make them easier to manage. Those measures will continue to be reported by the homes themselves, however. The changes mean many homes could drop a star or more from their January levels, even though nothing may have changed, officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. They declined to say how many might see a ratings drop. Consumer advocates welcomed the adjustments, but industry officials said the new rules may confuse patients and their families if scores change suddenly. “If centers across the country start losing star ratings overnight, it sends a signal to families and residents that quality is on the decline,” said Mark Parkinson, president and chief executive of the American Health Care Association, the industry lobby. But Brian Lee of Families for Better Care, a Florida-based advocacy group for nursing home residents and their families, said the shift was necessary. More information is always better, he said. He and other advocates had raised concerns that high rates were too easy to achieve. Lee said about 55 percent of the nation’s nursing homes had overall scores of either four or five stars on Nursing Home Compare in January. Lee said only about one-third of them got four or five stars on the Web site for inspections, which he called the most objective measure because it is based on government, rather than self-reported, data. “But when you look at the quality scores portion, 80 percent of homes are four- or five-star rated,” Lee said. “Something is not coming out in the wash.” The new ratings will be on the Web site Friday. Nursing home administrators were able to see their scores under the new system last week. The changes follow others announced in October that require additional verification of self-reported staffing levels and other attempts to confirm quality data submitted by the homes.

Correction: An earlier version of the article incorrectly identified Nancy Fee’s mother as Nancy. Her mother is Elizabeth Fee. This version has been updated. At age 88, Elizabeth Fee looked pregnant, her belly swollen after days of intestinal ailments and nausea. A nurse heard a scream from Fee’s room in a nursing home and found her retching “like a faucet” before she passed out. The facility where she died in 2012 was affiliated with a respected San Francisco hospital, California Pacific Medical Center, and shared its name. Fee had just undergone hip surgery at the hospital, and her family, pleased with her care, said they chose the nursing home with the hospital’s encouragement. Laura Rees, Fee’s elder daughter, said she was never told that the nursing home had received Medicare’s worst rating for quality — one star. Nor, she said, was she told that state inspectors had repeatedly cited the facility for substandard care, including delayed responses to calls for aid, disrespectful behavior toward patients and displaying insufficient interest in patients’ pain. “They handed me a piece of paper with a list of the different facilities on it, and theirs were at top of the page,” Rees said in an interview. “They kept pointing to their facility, and I was relying on their expertise and, of course, the reputation of the hospital.” Fee had an obstructed bowel, and state investigators faulted the home for several lapses in her care related to her death, including giving her inappropriate medications. In court papers responding to a lawsuit by Fee’s family, the medical center said the nursing home’s care was diligent. The center declined to discuss the case for this story. The selection of a nursing home can be critical: 39 percent of facilities have been cited by health inspectors over the past three years for harming a patient or operating in such a way that injuries are likely, government records show. Yet many case managers at hospitals do not share objective information or their own knowledge about nursing home quality. Some even push their own facilities over comparable or better alternatives. “Generally, hospitals don’t tell patients or their families much about any kind of patterns of neglect or abuse,” said Michael Connors, who works at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, a nonprofit in San Francisco. “Even the worst nursing homes are nearly full because hospitals keep sending patients to them.” Hospitals say their recalcitrance is due to fear about violating a government decree that hospitals may not “specify or otherwise limit” a patient’s choice of facilities. But that rule does not prohibit hospitals from sharing information about quality, and a handful of health systems, such as Partners Healthcare in Massachusetts, have created networks of preferred, higher-quality nursing homes while still giving patients all alternatives. Such efforts to help patients are rare, said Vincent Mor, a professor of health services, policy and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, R.I. He said that when his researchers visited 16 hospitals around the country last year, they found that only four gave any quality information to patients selecting a nursing home. “They’re giving them a laminated piece of paper” with the names of nearby nursing facilities, Mor said. For quality information, he said, “they will say, ‘Well, maybe you can go to a website,’ ” such as Nursing Home Compare, where Medicare publishes its quality assessments. The federal government may change this hands-off approach by requiring hospitals to provide guidance and quality data to patients while still respecting a patient’s preferences. The rule would apply to information not only about nursing homes but also about home health agencies, rehabilitation hospitals and other facilities and services that patients may need after a hospital stay. “It has a substantial opportunity to make a difference for patients,” said Nancy Foster, a vice president at the American Hospital Association. But the rule does not spell out what information the hospitals must share, and it has yet to be finalized — more than a year after Medicare proposed it. And it faces resistance in Congress: The chairman of House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), has included it on a list of regulations Republicans should block early next year. The government has created other incentives for hospitals to make sure their patient placements are good. For instance, Medicare cuts payments to hospitals when too many discharged patients return within a month. “Hospitals didn’t use to care that much,” said David Grabowski, a professor of health-care policy at Harvard Medical School. “They just wanted to get patients out. Now there’s a whole set of payment systems that reward hospitals for good discharges.” But sometimes hospitals go too far in pushing patients toward their own nursing homes. In 2013, for instance, regulators faulted a Wisconsin hospital for not disclosing its ties when it referred patients to its own nursing home, which Medicare rated below average. In 2014, a family member told inspectors that a Massachusetts hospital had “steered and railroaded” her into sending a relative to a nursing home owned by the same health system. Researchers have found that hospital-owned homes are often superior to independent ones. Still, a third of nursing homes owned by hospitals in cities with multiple facilities had lower federal quality ratings than at least one competitor, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis. The lowest rating Medicare’s Nursing Home Compare gave the nursing home where Elizabeth Fee died one star out of five, meaning it was rated “much below average.” The hospital’s case managers told Fee’s family that the nursing home was merely an extension of the hospital and that “my mother would receive the same excellent quality of care and attention,” said Rees, her daughter. But state inspectors found shortcomings in seven visits to the nursing home between August 2009 and October 2011, records show. Inspectors found expired medications during two visits and, at another, observed a nurse washing only her fingertips after putting an IV in a patient with a communicable infection. Just four months before Fee arrived, inspectors cited the nursing home for not treating patients with dignity and respect and for failing to provide the best care. One patient told inspectors that her pain was so excruciating that she couldn’t sleep but that nurses and the doctor did not check to see whether her pain medications were working. “Nobody listens to me,” the patient said. “I was born Catholic, and I know it’s not right to ask to die, but I want to die just to get rid of the pain.” Fee ate little and had few bowel movements, according to the state health investigation. Fee’s family had hired a private nurse, Angela Cullen, to sit with her. Cullen became increasingly worried about Fee’s distended belly, according to Cullen’s affidavit taken as part of the lawsuit. She said her concerns were brushed off, with one nurse declining to check Fee’s abdomen by saying, “I do not have a stethoscope.” On the morning of her death, an X-ray indicated Fee might have a bowel obstruction or other problem expelling stool, the inspectors’ report said. That evening, after throwing up a large quantity of matter that smelled of feces, she lost consciousness. She died of too much fluid and inhaled fecal matter in her lungs, the report said. Bills of more than $150,000 Judge Ernest Goldsmith of the San Francisco Superior Court wrote in a ruling that Elizabeth Fee’s younger daughter, Nancy, “observed her mother drown in what appeared to be her own excrement.” Kathryn Meadows, the Fees’ attorney, said in a filing that the nursing home’s bills exceeded $150,000 for the three-week stay. Sutter Health, the nonprofit that owns the medical center and the nursing home, emphasized in court papers that Elizabeth Fee arrived at the facility with a low count of platelets that clot blood. Sutter’s expert witness argued that the near-daily visits from a physician that Fee received “far exceeds” what is expected in nursing home care. The physician and his medical group have settled their part of the case and declined to comment or discuss the terms; the case against Sutter is pending. California’s public health department fined Sutter $2,000 for the violations, including for waiting 16 hours before telling the physician about Fee’s nausea, vomiting and swollen abdomen. Last year, Sutter closed the nursing home. A week or so after Fee died, a letter addressed to her from California Pacific Medical Center arrived at her house. It read: “We would appreciate hearing about your level of satisfaction with the care you received on our Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Unit, the unit from which you were just discharged.” — Kaiser Health News Kaiser Health News is a national health-policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

The police officers knew something was wrong as soon as they walked into Donald Parojinog’s bedroom. The 83-year-old was dead — curled on his side atop a plastic-covered mattress. Air fresheners sat nearby, unable to mask the overwhelming odor of decay. The officers pulled back a thin blanket to find an emaciated, naked body covered with more than a dozen open sores. Five of the wounds were so deep that bones were exposed. The discovery led to a 21 / 2- year neglect investigation and ultimately the conviction of Donna Parojinog, the victim’s daughter and caregiver — a case that culminated with her sentencing hearing Monday in a Montgomery County courtroom. The central question: How much jail time, if any, should the 61-year-old educator, who had no previous criminal record, receive? “This raises a number of different issues which many people of our age have to deal with,” said Judge David Boynton, 55, ticking off the challenges of caring for aging parents. “It is difficult. It is expensive. It is emotionally demanding.” At the hearing, Parojinog said that her father, who had suffered three strokes, told her he was ready to die. He refused food, she said, and she heeded his wish. “He didn’t want to live if he could not get around on his own,” Parojinog, who has continued to care for her elderly mother, told the judge. Experts in elder care expect more neglect cases to surface around the country as people live longer and more suffer from dementia. Many of them are with family members who can become overwhelmed by stress and fail to provide the care that’s needed, said Mary Twomey, co-director of the National Center on Elder Abuse. “We can not like what she did,” Twomey said of Parojinog’s actions, “and still understand how she got into that situation.” Donald Parojinog once worked for the U.S. Postal Service and cut hair in a barber shop on Georgia Avenue in the District. He and his wife, Sylvia, were longtime members of Nativity Catholic Church, and Donald was an active member of a local Knights of Columbus chapter, serving for two years as the grand knight. A snappy dresser, he’d show up for Knights meetings in, say, a white suit, white shoes and a tie, while his buddies arrived casually attired. “Dressed to the nines,” his friend Bill Davis fondly recalled in an interview. Behind the chair at the barber shop, Donald was more reserved, conversing about the topic of the day but generally following the lead of his loyal customers. But by 2007, he was growing forgetful. The strokes eventually left him unable to get around on his own — a frustrating situation. “He wanted to be able to take care of himself and he couldn’t,” said another friend, Everett Crosson. Nor could he help his wife, who had also fallen ill, as much as he wanted to, according to Crosson and others. Stepping into the role of his caregiver was the couple’s daughter, Donna. As she took him to hospitals for treatment, nurses and doctors increasingly took note of Donald’s unkempt condition. They reported what they saw to social workers, who tried to arrange at-home assistance, according to prosecutors. But they said Donna Parojinog sometimes turned away help. “She was a red stop sign at the door. Do not come in,” Montgomery Deputy State’s Attorney John Maloney said in court Monday. On Jan. 18, 2011, the county’s 911 operators received a call from a woman speaking in a soft voice from her home on Billman Lane in the Glenmont area of the county. “I have an elderly, deceased person in my home,” Donna Parojinog said. “He’s not moving or responding, and he’s not breathing.” The 911 operator said they were sending someone right out. “Now, ma’am,” Parojinog responded, according to a recording of the call played in court, “when they come, do they have to have all those bells and whistles going on?” Montgomery Police Officer Chris Malouf arrived about the same time as the medics. Speaking in court Monday, he said he could smell the odor of a decaying body as he walked in. And he noticed something else: “There were flies in the entryway,” he said. “Flies were flying around everywhere.” The officers found Donald Parojinog on a hospital-style bed. Donna Parojinog told the officers that she had tried to give her father food three days earlier. The next day she saw her dad alive, but then she didn’t see him for two days — in large part because she spent that time in her own room, sick herself. “I had a very violent something, flu, virus. I don’t know what,” she told detectives. An autopsy showed that Donald Parojinog weighed 99 pounds at his death and had suffered from malnutrition and sepsis linked to the open sores on his body. On May 30, his daughter pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, admitting that she had neglected her father. As part of the deal, prosecutors agreed to ask for a maximum of 18 months behind bars — a reflection of Parojinog’s otherwise clean record. In court Monday, Maloney, the prosecutor, criticized her explanation that she was heeding her father’s wishes, saying that he was too mentally impaired to know what he wanted. “I don’t think he asked to die with bug larvae inside infected wounds,” Maloney said. “I don’t think he asked to die in his own feces and urine, and live in that squalor.” Parojinog’s two daughters spoke at the hearing. “She’s just a very caring and loving person,” one of them told Boynton. “Never malicious. Not a malicious bone in her body.” Her attorney, Jeffrey Harding, urged the judge to put her on probation, not in jail, so that her work as an educator wouldn’t be affected and she could continue caring for her mother. Parojinog spoke for about 11 minutes, starting off by saying how much she admired and loved her father. For him, living meant going to church on Sundays. It meant taking care of his wife. “When he couldn’t do that anymore, he lost interest in living,” she said. “He said so over and over again. He apologized all the time to my mother and to myself for having to care for him.” Then it was time for the judge, Boynton, who spoke about Donna Parojinog’s life outside the case. “There’s certainly a lot there that indicates you are an otherwise very fine person,” he told her. He acknowledged the hardships of caring for aging parents. But he drew a distinct line: Once a person assumes that role, he said, they have to at least provide a minimum level of care. “There has to be some punishment imposed. There has to be some message sent that this type of conduct is unacceptable and it cannot be tolerated by our community,” Boynton said. “If you can’t do what it takes, then initially you have to say no. You can’t say yes and fail to act. It’s that simple.” Boynton sentenced Parojinog to 12 months in the county jail. Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report.	221	"[{""start"": 427, ""end"": 664, ""text"": ""The discovery led to a 21 / 2- year neglect investigation and ultimately the conviction of Donna Parojinog, the victim’s daughter and caregiver — a case that culminated with her sentencing hearing Monday in a Montgomery County courtroom."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 101, ""end"": 426, ""text"": ""The 83-year-old was dead — curled on his side atop a plastic-covered mattress.

A former nurse who admitted to using her smartphone to snap illicit photos of unconscious patients’ body parts has turned in her nursing license. Kristen Johnson “did not contest the charge of moral unfitness in the practice,” the New York State Board of Regents announced. The 27-year-old was arrested in May after a nine-month investigation revealed she’d used her smartphone to snap a photo of an unconscious patient’s penis, which she texted to coworkers at Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, N.Y., according to court documents cited by the Post-Standard. On a separate occasion, Johnson used the phone to take a video of a nurse cleaning an incapacitated female patient’s gastrointestinal blood clot, the paper reported. The Onondaga County District Attorney’s Office opened an investigation after the nurse’s co-workers complained about Johnson’s texts. Police later discovered both the photo and the video on the nurse’s laptop. Authorities initially charged Johnson with two counts of second-degree unlawful surveillance and one count of second-degree disseminating unlawful surveillance, according to CBS affiliate WRGB. As part of a plea deal, Johnson pleaded guilty in November to disseminating an unlawful surveillance photo, a misdemeanor. The deal reduced felony charges against her but required her to give up her nursing license and spend three years on probation, according to the Post-Standard. “Despite what certain people seem to think, it is a crime in the state of New York to view, broadcast or record images of another person’s intimate body parts, surreptitiously,” Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said in a statement last year, according to the Post-Standard.

Federal efforts to strengthen inspections of the nation’s nursing homes are gaining momentum after a government probe uncovered instances of substandard care. The March 3 report by the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general found that an estimated one-third of residents suffered harm because of substandard care and that the chances of nursing home inspectors discovering these “adverse events” are “slim to none,” said Ruth Ann Dorrill, a deputy regional director for the inspector general and the manager of the investigation. Nearly 60 percent of these incidents were preventable — including injuries from falls or medication errors — and more than half of residents were hospitalized as a result, the report said. The cost to Medicare was an estimated $2.8 billion in 2011, investigators said. In 6 percent of the cases, poor care contributed to residents’ deaths. The findings were based on the review of medical records of a random sample of 653 residents whose nursing home stay of 35 days or less ended in August 2011. The study comes as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for oversight, is developing new rules required by the Affordable Care Act to improve nursing home care by establishing “quality assurance and performance improvement programs.” As part of this effort, the CMS created a Web site last summer containing resources and training materials that have been used in 5,000 facilities to reduce residents’ pressure ulcers and medication errors, a Medicare spokeswoman said. Once those rules are issued, probably later this year, the agency will direct inspectors “to review facility practices for identifying and reducing adverse events,” CMS chief Marilyn Tavenner wrote in a response included in the IG report. The CMS contracts with states to inspect nursing homes, usually with at least one registered nurse on the inspection team. After reviewing a September draft of the IG report, Medicare officials became interested in using the IG’s investigative techniques, methods not normally used in measuring nursing home quality, Dorrill said. For example, the IG and the CMS are working to condense the report’s list of 261 instances of actual harm so that nursing home operators and government inspectors can quickly spot health problems in a medical record that resulted from poor treatment, she added. The initial list of 261 instances was compiled by a team of physicians, geriatricians and nurse consultants who scoured the selected records to make these determinations on a case-by-case basis. Another strategy that the CMS plans to use, Dorrill said, is the “trigger tool” IG experts developed to identify potential harm. This tool is a list of 49 medical problems that are warning signs, such as when a resident has to go to the hospital or if a resident’s blood glucose level drops dangerously low. These strategies may help nursing home inspectors detect problems that do not emerge during typical inspections that focus on “what’s happening to residents today,” said Jane Straker, a research scholar at the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University in Ohio. Routine inspections — as opposed to inspections prompted by complaints — often take three days and occur every 9 to 15 months, said Robyn Grant, policy director for the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based national advocacy group. Inspectors look at the medical records of as many as 30 residents, depending on the size of the facility, and also check a range of other services, from housekeeping and food preparation to required social activities and protection of residents’ rights. They also assign a severity level to any violation of Medicare rules that determines whether the facility will be fined, and if so, how much. And their arrival may not come as a surprise, Grant said. The predictable schedule of inspections may give nursing homes a rough idea of when to expect the next one. She said residents and their families have reported improvements in staffing and other preparations before an inspection. Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.

Roberto Valencia, 73, had a pulmonary embolism about a decade ago and has suffered from the lingering physical debilitations ever since. Valencia lost his independence and now lives in a private room in Washington Home — a D.C. assisted-living facility where most residents are Medicaid patients. In September, Valencia and about 100 other residents received notice that nearby Sidwell Friends, an elite private school, purchased the property and that they all would have to vacate by December 2016. Valencia says he’s been left in a lurch. Washington Home hasn’t yet pinned down the exact date he has to move out. His son, Junior Valencia, has contacted other assisted-living facilities throughout the city with no success: They either didn’t return his phone calls or told him they were at capacity. “There is no relocation process plan,” said the younger Valencia, echoing concerns of other residents who say they too have had trouble reaching other facilities. “All the residents are kept in the dark.” The uncertainty residents and city leaders described during a Washington Home family council meeting Wednesday night — with a representative from the D.C. Department of Health on hand — comes after Sidwell Friends agreed to purchase the 5.7 acre site bordering the north side of its upper school campus along Wisconsin Avenue NW for $32.5 million. Sidwell — a prestigious Quaker school that President Obama’s two daughters attend — will consolidate onto a single campus in the Tenleytown area, moving its lower school campus in Bethesda to the site of Washington Home, which would close without plans to relocate to another facility. Residents say they only found out about the sale after it was complete, and they now are scrambling to find new homes in a limited market. One relative of a longtime resident said the families are “living in chaos.” According to the D.C. Department of Health, if a facility such as Washington Home plans to close, it must provide details of the closure to the city, including how it will handle moving logistics — transferring residents’ medical records, for instance — and the timeline for moving people out. Washington Home submitted an initial closure plan, but it was rejected because of a lack of supporting documentation. By law, the center still has plenty of time to submit, but the plans won’t be made public until they are approved, meaning residents won’t have all the details in writing until then. At Wednesday’s meeting, Tim Cox, Washington Home’s chief executive, told residents that the center is doing its best to ensure the closure goes as smoothly as possible. Social workers on staff will be helping residents facilitate their moves, Cox said. As the center prepares to close, some staff members have left, but the center has since instituted financial incentives to encourage retention, and the D.C. Department of Health said the center would still be held to the same standards. “I don’t want you to think that because the facility is undergoing closure we are not monitoring the facility,” said Sharon Lewis, an employee in the health-care facilities division of the D.C. Department of Health. Most of the patients say they would like to stay in the District to be near their families, but a limited number of spots in the city could make that challenging. When the sale was announced in September, there were few free beds available in nursing homes in the 18 other facilities throughout the city, according to the health department. Most of the city’s facilities were operating at or near capacity. And not every facility offers the same medical services as Washington Home, so not every facility would be a match for every Washington Home resident. Lewis said the District’s other facilities have been alerted to Washington Home’s closure, but the city does not regulate waitlists for those homes. Medicaid patients are eligible to move to facilities in Maryland and Virginia. Lynne Person, the director of D.C.’s Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program — a federally mandated program that helps residents in such facilities understand their rights — said city residents typically have to be rejected from two facilities in the city before their Medicaid is eligible out-of-state. That requirement has been waived for Washington Home residents as they seek to relocate. The process has been frustrating, Person said, adding that there is no reason why Washington Home shouldn’t have an approved closure plan by now. “If the Washington Home knew they were making this announcement to close the facility, I don’t know why they didn’t plan to submit this plan immediately after notification,” she said. “We’re pretty frustrated that there is no plan at this time.” If all the residents are not moved by December 2016, Washington Home has the option to lease back the property for an additional six months if it needs more time to make sure everyone is settled. Ellis Turner, Sidwell’s associate head of school, wrote in an email Thursday that the school has offered to assist with the transition for residents in various ways, including lending its administration and staff to pack up residents’ belongings and deliver their possessions and furniture to their new homes. Larry Ottinger — a 1978 Sidwell alumnus who wrote a letter to the school’s leader in October calling for more engagement with Washington Home residents to ensure an easy transition — attended Wednesday’s meeting, telling the families that Sidwell alumni stand in solidarity with them. “The primary responsibility there is with this home, but Sidwell has a responsibility to do due diligence,” Ottinger said. “It’s in the spirit of our values.”	218	"[{""start"": 1641, ""end"": 1783, ""text"": ""Residents say they only found out about the sale after it was complete, and they now are scrambling to find new homes in a limited market.

The call came right after lunchtime. “I’ve fallen again.” My great-aunt Emma sounded frustrated and frail. Her arm hurt too much to move, she said, let alone pick up the bag of groceries she’d just bought. It might be broken. Could I come pick her up and drive her to the emergency room? I tried not to panic. This was her fourth fall of the year. How bad was this break? And how would this affect her long recovery from the lung injury she sustained during the first fall? Emma is the kind of person I want to be when I finally grow up: sharp, indomitable, open to new experiences, independent. And always bandbox neat, often in a cute hat. However, as I waited for her in an emergency room cubicle to come back from X-rays, I realized I’d been in denial. It wasn’t that I hadn’t thought about losing her; as she went from her 80s to her 90s, I knew that was inevitable. But I hadn’t thought about what she might go through before that. It’s true that aging isn’t exactly what it used to be. Thanks to Botox and Viagra and other medical innovations, anyone with some money can look and act 30 at 50 or 50 at 70. Many boomers are working past 65. Mick Jagger is still strutting around. Age is just a number! But this approach to aging, however empowering, is a lie. Most of us won’t keep going strong until we’re felled by a painless heart attack in our sleep. Life is seldom so kind. Unfortunately, our medical system caters to extremes, taking care of you most quickly if you are critically ill, covering you financially only if you’re destitute. Emma’s X-rays revealed a clean break in her upper arm — they put her in a sling and sent her home with ibuprofen — but what happened after showed me how difficult it is for the elderly and their families to navigate health care in this country. Once she got home, Emma struggled with everything from eating to dressing to washing. Four days later, I got another call: She’d fallen again, trying to get out of the armchair she was sleeping in because lying flat in bed was too uncomfortable. She escaped with only a scraped knee, but we both realized she couldn’t be alone at night, at least not until her arm had healed. But because she hadn’t required surgery, insurance wouldn’t cover the astronomical costs of a rehab center. Nor would the long-term care insurance she’d been paying steep premiums to for years (unlike me, Emma has never been in denial of her frailty, taking care of everything from living wills to DNRs to funeral arrangements) kick in for at least three months. The doctor told us it would only take six weeks (barring re-injury) before she was out of the sling. Moving in with me wasn’t an option, and neither was me moving in with her. I could help with laundry, groceries, cooking and chauffeuring, but helping her bathe was off the list, since I have physical challenges of my own. It was time to look into home care. That process has given me a good idea of exactly how frustrating our medical system can be for most seniors and their families. Between a lack of information on most home care agencies (only agencies that provide skilled nursing get reviewed by the government), a rapidly worsening worker shortage and no financial relief for the services Emma actually needed, I now understand why one doctor told me a lot of people just wind up putting elders in nursing homes instead of having them stay home. Not wanting to take a risk on a freelancer on Craigslist, we searched for an agency, even though we knew that was no guarantee of safety. I learned that there are two tiers of services: Home health, which includes skilled nursing and physical therapy, and home care, which is getting assistance with hygiene, cooking, errands or making sure a senior with a history of falling doesn’t hurt herself while getting out of a chair in the middle of the night. Emma’s primary doctor gave us a referral to a home health agency, which provided both too much care and not enough. After declaring her homebound so Medicare would pay, the agency started sending physical therapists and nurses — which we didn’t necessarily need, considering I was already taking Emma to multiple doctor appointments each week. What the home health agency didn’t offer was night care, our most urgent need, so we had to go to a home care agency. Medicare doesn’t pay for a penny in that case, so Emma was lucky she had funds set aside. We had lots of choice: The home care industry has exploded in the last decade. A 2014 Forbes story reported that since 2000, the number of home care franchises has gone from 13 to 56; those franchises now exist in more than 6,000 locations. And according to the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, there are 33,000 home care and hospice organizations in the country. But researching reputable home care is quite a chore. Many agencies have very little presence online: a website and maybe two or three reviews on Yelp, hardly enough to make a smart decision. We wound up relying on a referral by a state social worker because we were so crunched for time. And that agency was neither reviewed on Yelp or on the Better Business Bureau, though it was listed on both sites. Luckily, that agency turned out to be a good one, but once we found Emma a night care taker, I saw how our eldercare system treats the people who actually do the caretaking. Despite the critical need for eldercare, getting the workers to do it is not easy. Sharona Hoffman, author of “Aging with a plan: How a Little Thought Today Can Vastly Improve Your Tomorrow,” explained to me that the tedious work of caring for people at home carries risks, such as back injuries from lifting a patient after a bath or dealing with a patient who gets violent or handsy due to dementia. The pay isn’t great; the night caregiver we found for Emma confided in her that her take-home pay was about $10 an hour, or minimum wage in California. (We paid the agency who oversaw her $16 an hour.) Unsurprisingly, turnover among these workers is as high as 60 percent. The shortage is only going to get worse, a phenomenon being dubbed the “caregiving cliff.” According to the Institute of Medicine, by 2030, the United States will need 3.5 million more workers in home care and geriatric medicine. Amy York, executive director of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, says the organization is focused on “creating a career versus a job” by urging state Medicare and Medicaid programs to raise salaries for such workers to persuade them to stay. There is also legislative action on workers’ rights, particularly on the state level. On Jan. 1, California  cracked down on home care agencies, requiring, among other things, that their employees register in a state database. While I find the idea of being able to get more information on the person I was entrusting with some of Emma’s most intimate care, like bathing, the consequences of that legislation hit us right away, with care-giving prices climbing to $21 an hour, with a four-hour minimum. None of the people I spoke to about non-medical long term care could offer a solution that would balance workers’ rights to make a living and seniors’ rights not to go bankrupt for the care they need. “There really isn’t a system to pay for long-term care,” York told me. But, York said, there is some hope for change. In January, Hawaii state Sen. Rosalyn Baker introduced a bill that would establish a universal home care plan. The bill would give seniors and the disabled a daily $70 subsidy for 365 days. Anyone who has paid income tax in Hawaii for a decade is eligible. Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and John Kasich have all addressed the elder care issue, with Clinton presenting a plan that would launch a government initiative to recruit workers and give tax breaks for family members who care for older relatives. None of this will likely benefit Emma in the short term, but months away from her 92nd birthday, she has regained the use of her arm and much of her independence. She no longer needs night care, though we have a plan in place when she does. Even with all the problems that have plagued her in the last 18 months, she remains the woman I hope to be should I make it, mostly unscathed, into my 90s. I may even buy a hat or two. And I’ll definitely have a number of home care agencies on speed dial.	216	"[{""start"": 3959, ""end"": 4185, ""text"": ""After declaring her homebound so Medicare would pay, the agency started sending physical therapists and nurses — which we didn’t necessarily need, considering I was already taking Emma to multiple doctor appointments each week"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5754, ""end"": 5955, ""text"": ""The pay isn’t great; the night caregiver we found for Emma confided in her that her take-home pay was about $10 an hour, or minimum wage in California.

Two days after a patient complained that a contract nurse fondled her at George Washington University Hospital in May 2013, administrators removed him from his duties and called D.C. police. Detectives questioned the suspect, and the San Diego firm that places contract nurses in hospitals across the country took him off its rolls. The nurse, 37-year-old Jared Kline, signed on with another company. That September, he was back at work, this time at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, according to a spokeswoman. A few months later, a patient complained to police that Kline fondled her, records show. Hospital officials suspended him and notified the D.C. Board of Nursing, and the hiring agency severed ties. Police said Kline sexually assaulted two more women after being removed from his duties at Washington Hospital Center — this past January and August — all while still being investigated in the previous incidents, the last while police were seeking him on an arrest warrant. It wasn’t until the D.C. Board of Nursing suspended Kline’s license on Sept. 18 that there was public notice of misconduct. The Maryland Board of Nursing followed suit in October. Police arrested Kline on Nov. 18 and charged him with assault and a misdemeanor sexual offense in Maryland as well as with three counts of felony sexual abuse in the District. Kline has been freed from custody pending trial. A review of records from police and nursing boards in Maryland and the District show that Kline took advantage of disparate reporting rules that shielded the public from internal reviews and police investigations. While hospital officials all said they reacted quickly to remove Kline, one failed to notify the District’s nursing board and none warned others about the alleged misconduct, records show. And without decisive action from police or regulatory agencies — such as an arrest or license revocation — Kline was free to continue practicing even after being removed from his duties and while under scrutiny by law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Prosecutors in the District earlier this month offered Kline a deal to plead guilty to one count of attempted second-degree sexual abuse and one count of misdemeanor sexual abuse of a patient. He would face up to three years in prison and have to voluntarily surrender his license. He has a court hearing scheduled for Jan. 7 in D.C. Superior Court. Kline could not be reached to comment; his attorney with the Public Defender Service did not return numerous phone calls. Kline denied to police that he intentionally did anything inappropriate and attributed any contact to misunderstandings or accidents during close-patient care, such as brushing a woman’s arm against his thigh to insert an IV or take blood pressure, according to a police report. But in each case, women reported that while they were sedated or pretending to be asleep, Kline positioned or placed their hands on his groin and rubbed against them. One woman told police that Kline gave her medicine her doctor ordered her not to take, causing her to feel “jittery” or “groggy,” according to a D.C. police affidavit. Another woman texted a friend while at the hospital, writing, “I want to leave. . . . He’s creepy,” according to nursing board records. The charges come as Maryland officials have tried to provide more oversight for health-care professionals such as Kline. Joshua M. Sharfstein, secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, recommended last year that nurses and other medical practitioners be treated the same as doctors, whose names are fed into a national database when they are fired or disciplined, even when criminal or other investigations are pending. That would have flagged Kline back in May 2013. “It’s very important that disciplinary actions are available to the people doing the hiring,” said Sharfstein, the top health official in Maryland, where a clinic in Bowie employed Kline without knowing that he had been removed from his duties at two hospitals in the District and that he was under police investigation. “It should make a great deal of difference in the decisions that are made.” Last year, Sharfstein urged that disclosure rules be relaxed and investigations sped up to better protect the public after a similar episode last year in the state. He reiterated those concerns in an interview after Kline’s arrest. Health officials in the District said they did everything they could to investigate Kline while ensuring that his rights were protected. “We followed the letter of the law,” said Rikin Mehta, the senior deputy director of the D.C. Health Regulation and Licensing Administration. “We acted as quickly as possible to protect the public against imminent harm.” But neither official would address whether more needs to be done to prevent or warn hospitals about medical workers under investigation. Mehta said the nursing board’s investigation of Kline “went pretty quickly.” He said a background check would flag only a criminal conviction or a license suspension. “We have to make sure due process is given before we take action,” Mehta said. D.C. police declined to comment on their investigation, citing pending court action. But the arrest affidavit describes detectives sorting through conflicting accounts from Kline — who they interviewed twice — and his patients. It wasn’t until a pattern emerged that the suspect’s version of accidentally touching patients seemed unlikely, according to those records. District health officials said their investigation into Kline was delayed by seven months because George Washington University failed to notify them after they fired the nurse in May. The first complaint the board received was in December from Washington Hospital Center, according to Karen V. Scipio-Skinner, the director of the D.C. Board of Nursing. Van Brathwaite, an assistant attorney general and counsel for the D.C. Department of Health, said reporting firings for medical misconduct is required under D.C. law. A GWU spokeswoman confirmed that Kline was removed from his duties May 14, 2013, but declined to address why regulators were not notified. Wendy M. Adkins, the hospital’s director of marketing and business development, said in a statement that the medical facility “took all necessary steps to protect its patients upon notification of the allegations relating to Mr. Kline including his immediate removal from any further patient care at GW Hospital and notification to his employer.” Adkins said the hospital contacted police “at the time the allegations were made known to us and cooperated with them fully in their investigation of this matter. We believe that we complied with all laws relating to this matter.” Detailing Kline’s odyssey through Maryland and the District is complicated by the lack of information made public, including in some records, such as the arrest affidavit. Most hospitals declined to identify the companies that hired Kline and placed him at their facilities, even while passing responsibility for conducting background checks to those companies. Representatives of United Medical Center did not return numerous phone calls since Kline’s arrest in November. Kline, who got his start as a nurse at a hospital emergency room in Iowa, began working as a traveling nurse in 2010. At some later point, a San Diego-based company, AYA Healthcare, found him a job at George Washington University Hospital. A company official said Kline had a clean background in Iowa. A spokeswoman for the hospital said that Kline worked there a short time before a patient complained of being sexually assaulted on May 12, 2013, while being treated for a migraine headache. The hospital and AYA removed him from patient care. D.C. police interviewed Kline on May 14 at its sexual assault unit. No charges were filed. Kline then signed on with another California traveling nurse company, American Mobile Heathcare. A spokesman said his résumé made no mention of working at GWU. A background check revealed “no prior incidents,” the spokesman said. The patient at Washington Hospital Center reported being sexually assaulted Dec. 29, 2013, after being taken to the emergency room for being intoxicated. The woman filed a complaint with the hospital and D.C. police, who again interviewed Kline, this time at the hospital. Again, no charges were filed. Washington Hospital Center removed Kline from his duties, as did American Mobile Healthcare. All the while, Kline was working at the Bowie Health Center in Maryland. Erika Murray, a spokeswoman for Dimensions Healthcare Systems, which runs the clinic, said he was hired June 25, 2012. She declined to name the outside agency. A patient complained that she was sexually assaulted Jan. 20, 2014, while being treated for an adverse reaction to a tetanus shot. Bowie police filed an arrest warrant Feb. 12, 2014, charging Kline in Maryland with assault and a misdemeanor sex offense. The health center spokeswoman said Kline was “immediately terminated and not allowed to return to any of our facilities.” The clinic and police reported Kline to the Maryland Board of Nursing Feb. 27, more than a month after the incident occurred, according to a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The spokesperson did not explain the delay. Kline, now being sought by authorities in Maryland, found another job or continued to work at United Medical Center in Southeast Washington. On Aug. 25, a patient complained that two days earlier, she had been sexually assaulted while being treated for an asthma attack. Police said Kline obtained her cellphone number from private records and texted her after she had been discharged. He told her she had left her makeup bag behind. The woman texted back a thank you and said she was returning, though she did not know who had sent her the message. Police said the response came: “Anytime love, Get better.” Police said that when the woman pulled up to the hospital, she “saw the same male nurse who sexually assaulted her walking with her makeup bag. He handed her the bag, and the complainant drove away.” That woman’s call to police led to his arrest.	215	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 189, ""text"": ""ys after a patient complained that a contract nurse fondled her at George Washington University Hospital in May 2013, administrators removed him from his duties and called D.C. polic"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 333, ""end"": 399, ""text"": ""The nurse, 37-year-old Jared Kline, signed on with another company"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 515, ""end"": 602, ""text"": ""A few months later, a patient complained to police that Kline fondled her, records show"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 713, ""end"": 985, ""text"": ""Police said Kline sexually assaulted two more women after being removed from his duties at Washington Hospital Center — this past January and August — all while still being investigated in the previous incidents, the last while police were seeking him on an arrest warran"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1167, ""end"": 1342, ""text"": ""Police arrested Kline on Nov. 18 and charged him with assault and a misdemeanor sexual offense in Maryland as well as with three counts of felony sexual abuse in the District."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2522, ""end"": 2966, ""text"": ""Kline denied to police that he intentionally did anything inappropriate and attributed any contact to misunderstandings or accidents during close-patient care, such as brushing a woman’s arm against his thigh to insert an IV or take blood pressure, according to a police report.

"A Mississippi man was arrested Friday on allegations that he apparently entered a nursing home to photograph the bedridden wife of Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) and posted an image of her online. The Madison Police Department said in a statement that Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28, of Pearl, Miss., was arrested because he ""illegally and improperly obtained an image of a vulnerable adult resident without their consent for his own benefit."" His bond has been set at $100,000. The police department declined to say whom Kelly allegedly targeted. But Cochran's attorney said the arrest was the result of an investigation prompted by concerns about an unauthorized photo of Cochran's wife that was posted online. ""Recently, an unauthorized picture of Senator Cochran’s wife was posted on the internet as part of a video,"" said the attorney, Donald Clark Jr. ""The picture was taken inside of Mrs. Cochran’s room near her bedside. Senator Cochran asked our firm to represent him in this matter. We believed a crime may have been committed and we immediately notified the City of Madison Police Department since St. Catherine’s Nursing Home is located in the City of Madison. The police conducted an investigation, still in progress, resulting in the arrest last night. As you can imagine, Senator Cochran’s first concern was that of the safety of his wife as well as the invasion of her privacy and dignity."" Kelly is a blogger who has posted items opposing Cochran and supporting his Republican primary challenger, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, the Jackson Clarion-Ledger newspaper reported. In a statement, McDaniel condemned Kelly's alleged actions. McDaniel's campaign said it has neither an official nor a volunteer relationship with Kelly. ""I've reached out to Senator Cochran directly to express my abhorrence for the reprehensible actions of this individual,"" McDaniel said. ""This criminal act is deeply offensive and my team and I categorically reject such appalling behavior. My thoughts and prayers are with Senator Cochran and his family."" Cochran's wife, Rose Cochran, has been a resident of the nursing home since 2000 and suffers from dementia, the Clarion-Ledger reported. Cochran's campaign raised questions about how McDaniel's campaign knew the matter involved Rose Cochran before it was reported Saturday morning, citing a voice mail left by McDaniel campaign manager Melanie Sojourner earlier that morning denouncing the incident. McDaniel's campaign called it ""unconscionable"" that the Cochran campaign would use the alleged incident to make accusations.

A nursing home operator in Maryland aggressively and illegally booted residents from its facilities to maximize payments it collected from public health plans and in many cases dropped the residents off at homeless shelters or inadequate living facilities, the state’s attorney general alleged in a sweeping lawsuit filed Wednesday in Montgomery County Circuit Court. The lawsuit asserts that the firm, Neiswanger Management Services (NMS), was acutely aware of the reimbursement differences between federal Medicare and the lesser rates paid by Medicaid, which uses state and federal money to provide health coverage for low-income patients. NMS’s motive, according to the attorney general: Leave bed space for new Medicare patients, who yield more than $500 a day in reimbursements, compared with roughly half that for Medicaid. The nursing home operation discharged patients without their consent once their Medicare coverage ran out and without the planning the state requires for placing them in a “safe and secure environment,” the lawsuit says. “They put hundreds of vulnerable patients at risk, and we think what they did was illegal,” said Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D). More than 700 people likely reside in the nursing home operator’s five facilities in Maryland, the lawsuit said. The company, based in Hyattsville, said Wednesday that it has done nothing wrong. “NMS strongly denies any wrongdoing and disputes the entirety of the attorney general’s allegations in this matter,” said Mark Yost, the company’s chief executive. “We intend to prove our case and will respond in the appropriate forum in due time.” The 62-page lawsuit covers the often complicated world of Medicare payments for people who are discharged from hospitals to a nursing home. According to the attorney general, NMS aggressively seeks these clients and then aggressively seeks to get them out after 100 days, when the Medicare reimbursements for that type of care run out. NMS kicked out patients even if their bills had been paid and did so without properly setting them up in their next living facility, Frosh said. Further, the patients whose income levels made them eligible to switch to Medicaid after the 100-day window closed also were booted because the nursing facility would have made less off Medicaid, according to the lawsuit. “They maximized the highest public payments, which is Medicare,” he added. “When that ends, they will take Medicaid, but only if they have empty beds.” When NMS issued “involuntary discharge notices” to its residents, it almost always said it was doing so because the residents failed to pay or failed to arrange for payment by Medicare, Medicaid or a third-party payer, according to the litigation. The attorney general’s office compared the number of discharge notices at NMS’s five nursing homes with those at 225 other nursing homes. Over a 17-month period ending May 31, NMS facilities issued 1,061 discharge notices, the attorney general said, compared with 510 such notices at the state’s other nursing homes combined. “That just smacks you in the face,” Frosh said. “They’re doing something that nobody else is doing.” One former resident of an NMS facility in Hagerstown, Andrew Edwards, said Wednesday in an interview that his stay at the nursing home was fine. Edwards, 31, is cited by name as an example in the state’s lawsuit. “All the nurses were good,” he said. “The therapy was great.” He suffers from kidney disease, needs dialysis and used a walker, the lawsuit and he said. The problem with Edwards’s care, the lawsuit alleges, occurred after an NMS staff member loaded him into a vehicle with a woman, assuring Edwards that she would take him to an assisted-living facility.

Within two weeks of Joyce Oyler’s discharge from the hospital, sores developed in her mouth and throat, and blood began seeping from her nose and bowels. Her daughter traced the source of these problems to the medicine bottles in Oyler’s home in St. Joseph, Mo. One drug that keeps heart patients such as Oyler from retaining fluids was missing. In its place was a toxic drug with a similar name but a different purpose, primarily to treat cancer and severe arthritis. The label said to take it daily. “I gathered all her medicine, and as soon as I saw that bottle, I knew she couldn’t come back from this,” said Kristin Sigg, the younger of her two children. “There were many layers and mistakes made after she left the hospital. It should have been caught about five different ways.” Oyler’s death occurred at one of the most dangerous junctures in medical care: when patients leave the hospital. Bad coordination often plagues patients’ transition to the care of home health agencies as well as to nursing homes and other professionals charged with helping them recuperate, studies show. “Poor transitional care is a huge, huge issue for everybody, but especially for older people with complex needs,” said Alicia Arbaje, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. “The most risky transition is from hospital to home with the additional need for home care services, and that’s the one we know the least about.” Medication mistakes like the one in Oyler’s case — which slipped past both her pharmacist and home health nurses, according to court records — are, in fact, one of the most common complications for discharged patients. The federal government views them as “a major patient safety and public health issue,” and a Kaiser Health News analysis of government records shows such errors are frequently missed by home health agencies. Between January 2010 and July 2015, the analysis found, inspectors identified 3,016 home health agencies — nearly a quarter of all those examined by Medicare — that had inadequately reviewed or tracked medications for new patients. In some cases, nurses failed to realize that patients were taking potentially dangerous combinations of drugs, risking abnormal heart rhythms, bleeding, kidney damage and seizures. The variety of providers that patients may use after a hospitalization creates fertile ground for error, said Don Goldmann, chief medical and science officer at the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement. “This episodic care at different places at different times is not designed to keep the overall safety of the patient in mind,” Goldmann said. One factor is the lack of organization and communication among these other parts of the medical system. Of the $30 billion that Congress appropriated to help shift the system to electronic medical records — to ensure better coordination of care and reduce errors across the board — none went to nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities or providers working with individuals in their homes. “The systems are not adequately connected,” said Robert Wachter, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco who studies patient safety. At any point, problems can occur. At hospitals, federal data show that fewer than half of patients say they’re confident that they understand the instructions of how to care for themselves after discharge. In nursing homes, case management frequently comes up short. A 2013 government report found more than a third of facilities did not properly assess patients’ needs, devise a plan for their care and then follow through on that. And at home health agencies, failures to create and execute a care plan are the most common issues government inspectors identify, followed by deficient medication review, according to KHN’s analysis. Over the first half of this decade, 1,591 agencies — 1 in 8 — had a defect inspectors considered so substantial that it warranted the agencies’ removal from the Medicare program unless the lapses were remedied. ‘Devastating’ cancer drug Oyler’s death in October 2013 shows how a fatal mistake can slip past multiple checkpoints. The 66-year-old retired safety manager left Heartland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph after being treated for congestive heart failure, in which the heart fails to pump effectively, causing fluid buildup in the lungs, shortness of breath and swelling in the feet. She returned home as a hospital nurse telephoned the local Hy-Vee Pharmacy with eight new prescriptions. One was for the diuretic metolazone. But the medications a pharmacy technician wrote down did not include metolazone. Instead, it listed methotrexate, which can damage blood cell counts, organs and the lining of the mouth, stomach and intestines. The drug is so potent that the Institute for Safe Medication Practices includes it among eight “high-alert” medications with consequences so “devastating” that they warrant special safeguards against incorrect dispensing. Oyler’s prescription included daily-dosage instructions for the diuretic. Methotrexate is never supposed to be taken more than once or twice a week for patients not being treated for cancer, and almost always at a much lower dose. In a court deposition taken as part of the lawsuit the family brought, Hy-Vee’s pharmacist blamed himself for not catching the error. “For whatever reason, on that certain day, that didn’t trigger with me,” he testified. Hy-Vee argued that its safeguards were as strong as those at other pharmacies, although the pharmacy manager admitted in a deposition that “quite honestly, there was a breakdown in the system.” The family’s attorney, Leland Dempsey, said court evidence suggested the drug mix-up was made by the pharmacy technician who took the prescription orders. “The pharmacy tech made numerous spelling errors on the drugs,” he said. “She had a dosage off on another drug.” In February, a jury awarded Oyler’s family $2 million in damages from the pharmacy. The judge lowered the award to $125,000 because of Missouri’s cap for noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases. Hy-Vee declined to comment. Nurses overlook prescription mistake Yet the error could have been snagged right as Oyler began getting care from Heartland’s home health care agency. Medicare requires home health agencies to examine details of a patient’s medications to ensure all the drugs match the prescriptions ordered, are being taken in the right dose and frequency, and don’t have negative interactions. Still, neither of two Heartland nurses who visited Oyler at home stopped her from taking the wrong drug. Less than a year before, Missouri state inspectors had cited the agency for inadequately reviewing medications for three patients. State records show it had pledged to make improvements. “Why they didn’t catch it was beyond me,” Oyler’s husband, Carl, said recently. “They had a printout from the hospital” with every medication correctly listed. “It was all there,” he said. After 18 days, her family took her to North Kansas City Hospital, where doctors determined that the methotrexate had irreparably damaged her bone marrow’s ability to create blood cells. She died three days later of multiple organ failure. “By the time we got her into the emergency room, essentially she had no blood cell count,” her husband recounted. “It was irreversible. It was a gruesome, slow, painful way to die.” Heartland Regional Medical Center paid Oyler’s family $225,000 in a settlement last year, court records show. Mosaic Life Care, the name by which Heartland now operates, said in a statement that it is “consistently improving processes and adopting new technologies to further reduce risks of errors and to improve communication.” “Most people don’t know this is a problem,” Sigg said. “They assume doctors are talking to each other, until they experience it, and it’s not the case.” — Kaiser Health News Kaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Tornado, hurricane or flood, nursing homes are woefully unprepared to protect frail residents in a natural disaster, government investigators say. Emergency plans required by the government often lack specific steps such as coordinating with local authorities, notifying relatives or even pinning name tags and medication lists to residents during an evacuation, according to the findings. Nearly seven years after Hurricane Katrina’s devastation of New Orleans exposed the vulnerability of nursing homes, serious shortcomings persist. “We identified many of the same gaps in nursing home preparedness and response,” investigators from the inspector general’s office of the Department of Health and Human Services wrote in the report being released Monday. “Emergency plans lacked relevant information . . . Nursing homes faced challenges with unreliable transportation contracts, lack of collaboration with local emergency management and residents who developed health problems.” The report recommended that Medicare and Medicaid add specific emergency planning and training steps to the existing federal requirement that nursing homes have a disaster plan. Many such steps are in nonbinding federal guidelines that investigators found were disregarded. In a written response, Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner agreed with the recommendation but gave no timetable for carrying it out. Nationally, more than 3 million people spent at least some time in a nursing home during 2009, according to the latest available data. Nearly 40 percent of them, 1.2 million, were in the top 10 disaster-prone states. The typical nursing-home resident is a woman in her 80s or older, dealing with physical and mental limitations that leave her dependent on others for help with basic daily activities. Investigators pursued a two-track approach. First they looked at the number of nursing homes that met federal regulations for emergency planning and training. Then they went into the field to test how solid those plans were, in a sample of homes drawn from 210 facilities substantially affected by floods, hurricanes and wildfires across seven states from 2007 to 2010. On the surface, things appeared to be in good order. Ninety-two percent of the nation’s 16,000 nursing homes met federal regulations for emergency planning, while 72 percent met the standards for emergency training. A different story emerged when inspectors showed up at 24 selected nursing homes and started pulling files and interviewing staff members. The specific facilities in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas were not identified in the report. All had been affected by disasters; 14 had evacuated, and the remainder sheltered in place. A detailed, well-rehearsed emergency plan is a basic requirement for disaster preparedness. But at one home, the emergency plan was in several boxes. At another one, it was on a legal pad. Of the 24 emergency plans, 23 did not describe how to handle a resident’s illness or death during an evacuation. Also, 15 had no information about the specific medical needs of patients, such as feeding tubes and breathing equipment. Seven plans were silent on how to identify residents in an evacuation, such as by attaching wristbands or name tags. Inspectors said 15 made no provision for including medication lists. None of the nursing homes met a government recommendation for a seven-day supply of drinking water if residents had to shelter in place and their regular source of water was unsafe or unavailable. Twenty-two had no backup plans to replace staff members unable to report for work during a disaster. Transportation was an Achilles’ heel. None of the nursing homes had planned to ensure transportation of adequate food and water for evacuated residents, while 19 had no specific plan for transporting wheelchairs and similar equipment. Twenty-two of the plans did not describe how the nursing home would transport medications. Seventeen had no specific plan for working with local emergency coordinators to decide whether to evacuate or shelter in place. Administrators and staff members from 17 of the nursing homes told investigators that they faced substantial challenges in responding to the disasters that hit their areas. A common problem was that transportation contracts were not honored after an evacuation was called. Four nursing homes that did evacuate said they had problems trying to keep track of residents and supplies — in some cases temporarily losing patients. The vulnerability of nursing-home patients became a national issue when 35 residents of St. Rita’s Nursing Home outside New Orleans died during Katrina. Some drowned in their beds. Prosecutors charged the owners of the facility with negligent homicide, saying they should have evacuated the home. But a jury acquitted them of all charges. Some jurors said afterward that Louisiana authorities should have taken responsibility for the safety of nursing-home residents ahead of the monster storm. A Houston Chronicle investigation found that at least 139 ­nursing-home residents died during the hurricane or its aftermath. The top 10 disaster-prone states, as ranked by historical statistics on major disaster declarations, are Texas, California, Oklahoma, New York, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas and Missouri. — Associated Press “We identified many of the same gaps in nursing home preparedness and response” that cost many residents their lives when Hurricane Katrina hit. — Investigative report by the Department of Health and Human Services	211	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 145, ""text"": ""o, hurricane or flood, nursing homes are woefully unprepared to protect frail residents in a natural disaster, government investigators say"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 808, ""end"": 980, ""text"": ""Nursing homes faced challenges with unreliable transportation contracts, lack of collaboration with local emergency management and residents who developed health problems."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1123, ""end"": 1157, ""text"": ""nursing homes have a disaster plan"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2840, ""end"": 2935, ""text"": ""ut at one home, the emergency plan was in several boxes.

A nurse who recently moved to the Washington region from Iowa is facing criminal charges after being accused of sexually abusing four female patients at three D.C hospitals and a Prince George’s County health clinic. Jared Nathan Kline, 37, who lives in Falls Church, was arrested Tuesday and charged with fondling patients and forcing them to inappropriately touch him. He was released from custody Wednesday by a D.C. Superior Court judge, who ordered him to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet until a preliminary hearing Dec. 10. Officials reached at three of the four medical centers said they are working with authorities and have the best interests of patients in mind, although two declined to offer details on the case. One hospital did not return calls seeking comment. Court documents describe Kline as a traveling nurse, with a nursing license from Iowa, who contracts his services to various local hospitals. A report from the D.C. Board of Nursing shows that after Kline was fired or suspended from one hospital, he had lined up work or was already working at others from May 2013 to August 2014, even as he was being investigated by police and the nursing board. In addition, those board records show that he was hired at a hospital in Southeast Washington six months after police issued a warrant for his arrest in Maryland, where he was accused of an attack at a clinic in Bowie. Authorities could not immediately explain whether the regulatory agency tells hospitals of pending investigations during background checks or whether hospitals routinely check with the board when they hire staff. The board, which is responsible for licensing nurses, suspended Kline’s ability to practice nursing in the District on Sept. 18, after the last accusation was made. The Board of Nursing lists a post office box in Annandale and a house in Falls Church as addresses for Kline. A person who answered the phone at the house hung up when a reporter called. Kline’s résumé posted online lists numerous jobs at hospitals and clinics in Iowa and indicates a move to the D.C. area in late 2012 or early 2013. In two cases, police interviewed Kline shortly after women filed complaints but said they needed more time to sort out the stories. In those cases, police said, Kline denied the allegations that he had forced patients to touch his genitals and described any contact as inadvertent. The allegations detailed in an expansive police affidavit filed in D.C. Superior Court are similar: While treating patients, Kline allegedly touched them in sexual ways or pressed himself against them. In some cases, victims told police that they were groggy from drugs and couldn’t immediately fight back or clearly understand what was happening. One woman told police that she pretended to be asleep. All the alleged victims are female; police initially said one was male. The first allegation was made May 12, 2013, at George Washington University Hospital’s emergency room. A patient told police that, against the advice of her doctor, a male nurse named Jared had given her an intravenous injection of Benadryl, which can cause drowsiness. While draping a blanket over the woman, the nurse groped her buttocks, according to a police affidavit. Later, as she was partly asleep, she said, he came into her room several times and forced her to inappropriately touch him. The hospital fired Kline two days later, according to the nursing board. A George Washington hospital spokeswoman read a statement saying the facility “is committed to the well being of our patients” and acts “swiftly with law enforcement and other regulatory agencies.” On Dec. 29, Kline was working at MedStar Washington Hospital Center and treating a woman who had passed out from being intoxicated. Police said that Kline was with her when she woke up and that he rubbed against her outstretched hand. Kline told police that he had a difficult time inserting an IV. He told authorities that he had worked at the hospital for four months. MedStar officials suspended him and reported the incident to the Board of Nursing. A spokeswoman for MedStar Washington Hospital Center declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Records show Kline was already working at Bowie Health Center in Maryland, where he was accused in January of rubbing against a woman while inserting an IV. He was fired Feb. 14 after Prince George’s police charged him in an arrest warrant. Erika Murray, a spokeswoman for Dimensions Health Systems, which oversees the medical clinic in Bowie, said Kline was not an employee. He was hired, she said, on a contractual basis from an outside agency, which performed the background check. That check, she said, did not show any problems. After he left the Bowie clinic, Kline, who was being sought by police, was working at United Medical Center in Southeast Washington, according to the Board of Nursing. Police said on Aug. 23, a woman complained that while being treated for asthma and on medication that made her “jittery,” he rubbed against her several times, unfastened her gown, massaged her back and ran his fingers through her hair. After the woman was discharged, Kline obtained her cellphone number from hospital records and texted her about makeup she had left behind, police said. After she responded, police said that he texted her, “Anytime love, get better.” The woman turned the texts over to D.C. police, who traced the number to Kline’s cellphone.	210	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 215, ""text"": ""A nurse who recently moved to the Washington region from Iowa is facing criminal charges after being accused of sexually abusing four female patients at three D.C hospitals and a Prince George’s County health clinic"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 217, ""end"": 370, ""text"": ""ared Nathan Kline, 37, who lives in Falls Church, was arrested Tuesday and charged with fondling patients and forcing them to inappropriately touch him."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1344, ""end"": 1399, ""text"": ""where he was accused of an attack at a clinic in Bowie."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2245, ""end"": 2393, ""text"": ""In those cases, police said, Kline denied the allegations that he had forced patients to touch his genitals and described any contact as inadverten"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2495, ""end"": 2596, ""text"": ""While treating patients, Kline allegedly touched them in sexual ways or pressed himself against them."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2597, ""end"": 2796, ""text"": ""n some cases, victims told police that they were groggy from drugs and couldn’t immediately fight back or clearly understand what was happening.
