Republicans in Congress have long aimed to cut Planned Parenthood’s federal funding. Despite the failure on Friday of the American Health Care Act, many observers expect Congress to try, try again to ensure that Planned Parenthood cannot receive Medicaid and Title X payments for delivering women’s reproductive health-care services such as mammograms, contraception and Pap smears. (The 1976 Hyde Amendment bans using federal funding to underwrite abortions, so what is at stake is money for other health-care services for women.) However, the Congressional Budget Office’s recent report on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) estimated that such a move would both reduce women’s access to health care and lead to more births. I investigated the potential public health ramifications if congressional representatives were to respond to pro-life sentiment. A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that 75 percent of the nation favors continuing federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Perhaps because of its range of non-abortion services, public support for funding Planned Parenthood exceeds the public’s support for the legality of abortion, which the Pew Forum recently found is 57 percent nationally. But national numbers obscure major regional differences. Examining opinion at the state level, support for abortion rights varies greatly. In, say, West Virginia, only 35 percent of the state approves of abortion. Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, that approval is as high as 74 percent. Many other states are more narrowly divided. And the prevalence of Planned Parenthood clinics is positively associated with support for the continued legality of abortion. Planned Parenthood as a health-care “safety net” Precisely what percentage of Planned Parenthood’s efforts go to which services has been debated. But this much is clear: PP clinics offer a wide range of health services, including contraceptive care, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV testing, and cancer screenings. Further, PP clinics are what public health people call “safety-net health centers”: a last-chance offering for those who couldn’t pay full price if they had to, but who are covered by Medicaid. Thus, Medicaid patients can use their coverage toward non-abortion services, with Planned Parenthood submitting for reimbursement for the rest of the fees (as it does with private insurance as well). Planned Parenthood receives $553.7 million, or 43 percent of its total revenue, from this source of funding, according to its 2014-15 annual report. In two-thirds of the counties in which a Planned Parenthood clinic is located, that clinic serves at least half of the women who turn to a safety-net health center to get contraception. And in 103 of the 491 counties in which a Planned Parenthood clinic is located, that clinic is the only safety-net provider women on Medicaid can turn to if they want contraception. Few family planning centers accept Medicaid patients. Therefore, public health is powerfully affected by whether a county has — or does not have — a Planned Parenthood clinic. And with such issues as unintended pregnancy, STDs and HIV all associated with significant economic impacts, failure to access services to reduce their prevalence could result in both declines in public health and costs to the federal government. How I did my research I identified the total number of Planned Parenthood clinics that were operating annually in each state between 2008 and 2013, and determined the number per capita in each state. With data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about every state’s annual teenage birthrate and annual rate of STD diagnoses, we can see whether there’s any relationship between access to PP clinics and public health along those two measures. Of course, higher teen births and more STDs might also be related to higher levels of poverty and lower rates of being insured. I controlled for these additional factors, as you can see in my paper. My working hypothesis was that in the years that particular states had more Planned Parenthood clinics — and therefore more of its residents could get reproductive health care — those states would have lower rates of teen births and STDs. (The caveat is that STD diagnoses might actually increase with more access to care, as people get diagnosed and treated rather than remaining ill and untreated, thus making showing fewer reported STDs).   And indeed, that’s what I found. Reduced clinic access is associated with higher rates of teen births; more clinics per capita are associated with fewer teens having children. I find an even stronger relationship between clinic prevalence and STD diagnoses. That is, the more Planned Parenthood clinics in a state in a given year, the fewer teen births and STD diagnoses. I find similar effects of Planned Parenthood clinic access on the health outcomes of HIV diagnoses and reliance on emergency room care. Other factors are at work as well. For instance, Planned Parenthood clinics are not randomly distributed. States that have more could very well have other social programs that help reduce the rate of teen births and STDs. Although I account in the statistical model for whether states mandate the provision of sex education as opposed to abstinence-only, and there does not appear to be a strong association between Planned Parenthood clinic access and the number of hospital beds per capita, other health and social program delivery could affect these outcomes. But the findings suggest that unless other health centers were willing to offer reproductive health care to many more Medicaid patients, fewer Planned Parenthood clinics (the probable result of refusing PP the use of federal funding) would almost certainly hurt many states’ public health. That affects economic stability as well. Research has found that teenagers who give birth are considerably less likely to earn a high school diploma or college degree, thus resulting in lost earnings, higher rates of poverty and crime, and diminished prospects for upward economic mobility. Moreover, those born to teen parents are themselves likely to have poorer educational and health outcomes than are those born to older parents, with both such factors associated with economic security. Although social program delivery is often a source of political contention between the parties, and the complication of Planned Parenthood’s association with abortion certainly amplifies that tension, the public health benefits that appear to be associated with its prevalence may reap both economic and health advantages for many women and their families. Reforming health policy is not easy. While responding to public opinion over abortion can help particular members of Congress get reelected, defunding Planned Parenthood may carry a significant price tag for their districts.

Young men and boys who receive sex education before age 18 are more likely than others to use more than one type of contraception, such as a condom in addition to their female partner’s hormonal birth control, according to a small study. “The dual method significantly decreases the chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or having an unplanned pregnancy,” said lead author Nicole Jaramillo, a public health researcher at San Diego State University. “This is especially important among adolescent males with the growing use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods among their female partners,” she said. “It is still very important to promote and educate about the use of condoms for STI prevention.” Jaramillo and colleagues looked at data from 539 heterosexual boys and men, 15 to 20 years old, who answered the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth and reported being sexually active. The survey asked whether they had received sex education about seven topics: STIs, HIV/AIDS, how to say no to sex, birth control methods, where to get birth control, how to use a condom, and abstinence. The survey also asked about contraceptive use during their last sexual intercourse, including whether they had relied only on female-controlled methods such as the pill or LARC, relied only on male-controlled methods such as vasectomy or condoms, used a combination of contraceptive methods or used no method. Almost all of the participants — 99 percent — said they had received sex education on at least one topic, and 19 percent said they had learned about all seven. Most learned about STIs (95 percent) and HIV/AIDS (92 percent). The least commonly taught topic was where to find birth control, with less than 42 percent saying they had received such instruction. Most, 91 percent, reported using contraception. Condoms alone were used by almost 44 percent, almost 9 percent had relied on female-only methods and 39 percent used dual methods. Having learned about birth control methods and how to say no to sex were associated with dual-contraception use. With exposure to each additional sex education topic, the odds of using dual methods increased by 47 percent, researchers found. “This study allowed us to look at the different topics of sex education rather than grouping the topics as ‘abstinence only’ versus ‘comprehensive’ sex education,” Jaramillo said. “Sex education that focuses on a broad range of topics is the most effective form of sex education.” In the United States, STI rates have increased in recent years, Jaramillo added. In 2013, about 20 million Americans contracted an STI, with about half of the cases among people age 15 to 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, chlamydia, gonorrhea and primary and secondary syphilis cases rose to an all-time high in 2015, the authors write in Journal of Adolescent Health. U.S. rates of STIs and unintended pregnancies are among the highest in industrialized countries, the study team notes. However, U.S. teen birthrates have dropped to an all-time low of 24 births per 1,000 girls and women between ages 15 and 19, according to CDC data. “We know young men play a key role in making decisions about contraceptives, but not many reproductive health programs target them,” said Jennifer Manlove, a reproductive health researcher at Child Trends in Bethesda. “We know from other research that high-quality programs are engaging, interactive and targeted toward the population,” said Manlove, who was not involved in the study. “Programs should highlight men’s role in contraception.”	196	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 237, ""text"": ""men and boys who receive sex education before age 18 are more likely than others to use more than one type of contraception, such as a condom in addition to their female partner’s hormonal birth control, according to a small study."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 239, ""end"": 471, ""text"": ""The dual method significantly decreases the chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or having an unplanned pregnancy,” said lead author Nicole Jaramillo, a public health researcher at San Diego State University"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2404, ""end"": 2503, ""text"": ""Sex education that focuses on a broad range of topics is the most effective form of sex education."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3185, ""end"": 3401, ""text"": ""We know young men play a key role in making decisions about contraceptives, but not many reproductive health programs target them,” said Jennifer Manlove, a reproductive health researcher at Child Trends in Bethesda."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	205	2023-03-23T15:54:08.575671Z	2023-03-23T15:54:08.575779Z	466.233
"Earlier this week, an influential pediatrics group offered a pretty significant new recommendation: that teenagers use long-acting contraceptives, like intrauterine devices and hormone implants, as the ""first line"" of defense in preventing pregnancy pregnancy. And a new study released Wednesday night helps illustrate why the physicians group offered its endorsement. Teenage girls who were offered these types of contraceptives at no cost were significantly much more likely to use them, and they had substantially lower rates of pregnancy, birth and abortion when compared to U.S. teens, according to the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. Just about 4.5 percent of U.S. teens between 15-19 report using long-acting contraceptive methods, which have a much lower fail rate under typical use (less than 1 percent) when compared to birth control pills (9 percent) and male condoms (18 percent), according to the CDC. The costs can be prohibitive, though. Without insurance, an IUD could cost more than $1,000 for a one-time insertion. But removing financial and educational barriers to accessing these forms of birth control increased their usage, according to the NEJM study, which holds pretty major implications for the U.S. teen birth rate that — despite hitting record lows last year — is still 5.5 times higher than the rate in Western Europe and trails the rest of the developed world. For the study, researchers at Washington University in Saint Louis provided free contraception to thousands of local women through the CHOICE Contraceptive Project. They were given their choice of method after being informed of effectiveness rates, potential side effects and the risks and benefits of each. Of the 1,404 teens in the NEJM study spanning 2007 to 2011, 74 percent chose long-acting methods — more than 16 times the reported rate of usage for U.S. teenage women. The results were pretty stark. Teens in the CHOICE program, when compared to the national average, were five times less likely to get pregnant or give birth, and they were about four times less likely to have an abortion. The average annual birth rate in the CHOICE group — in which three-quarters used a long-acting contraceptive — was 19.4 per 1,000 teens, which was 36 percent lower than the CDC's 2015 goal of 30.3 per 1,000 teens. And two-thirds of teens in the CHOICE program who chose a long-acting method were still using it after two years, much better than the rate for those using a different method (one-third). The NEJM study also comes just months after Colorado reported a state health initiative reduced the teen birth rate by 40 percent over five years by providing IUDs and other implantable devices to low-income women. That program was funded by an anonymous donor, so it's not the kind of thing that could be easily recreated across the country. Notably, though, the Affordable Care Act requires most health plans to provide no-cost birth control, which is at the heart of the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision and still-pending religious challenges to the law's contraceptive coverage mandate. Even though use of long-acting contraceptives is still low among U.S. teens, the researchers note that it has increased from less than 1 percent in 2002. ""Our study suggests that it is possible to achieve a much greater rate of use,"" they wrote. And that could help tackle a teen pregnancy problem that the CDC calls a ""winnable battle."""	195	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 259, ""text"": ""r this week, an influential pediatrics group offered a pretty significant new recommendation: that teenagers use long-acting contraceptives, like intrauterine devices and hormone implants, as the \""first line\"" of defense in preventing pregnancy pregnancy"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 369, ""end"": 652, ""text"": ""ge girls who were offered these types of contraceptives at no cost were significantly much more likely to use them, and they had substantially lower rates of pregnancy, birth and abortion when compared to U.S. teens, according to the study in the New England Journal of Medicine"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1047, ""end"": 1238, ""text"": ""ut removing financial and educational barriers to accessing these forms of birth control increased their usage, according to the NEJM study, which holds pretty major implications for the U.S"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1405, ""end"": 1569, ""text"": ""For the study, researchers at Washington University in Saint Louis provided free contraception to thousands of local women through the CHOICE Contraceptive Project."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2506, ""end"": 2720, ""text"": ""The NEJM study also comes just months after Colorado reported a state health initiative reduced the teen birth rate by 40 percent over five years by providing IUDs and other implantable devices to low-income women."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3101, ""end"": 3253, ""text"": ""Even though use of long-acting contraceptives is still low among U.S. teens, the researchers note that it has increased from less than 1 percent in 2002"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3101, ""end"": 3253, ""text"": ""Even though use of long-acting contraceptives is still low among U.S. teens, the researchers note that it has increased from less than 1 percent in 2002"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	204	2023-03-23T15:46:19.373147Z	2023-03-23T15:46:19.373256Z	1142.701
  New evidence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this morning points to the ongoing and significant drop in the U.S. teen birth rate over the past 2o-plus years. The birth rate for teenagers ages 15-19 was 26.6 births per 1,000 in 2013, down 57 percent from the rate of 61.8 births per 1,000 in 1991, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC attributes the 20-year decline to decreased sexual activity among teens, as well as more frequent use of contraception. As you would imagine, this historic decline in the teen birth rate has looked differently across states, races and age. The CDC report highlights some important ways in how this decline hasn't played out quite evenly. The age difference The birth rates for the 10-14, 15-17 and 18-19 age brackets were all at record lows in 2013. The decline has been much greater though, for girls 15-17. The 12.3 birth per 1,000 rate for teens 15-17 fell 68 percent since 1991, compared to 50 percent for teens 18-19, whose rate is 47.3 births per 1,000. More recently, the decline in birth rates since 2007 has also been greater for the 15-17 group (43 percent compared to 34 percent). Which groups have seen the biggest declines? The teen birth rate has declined across all racial groups since 1991, but the steepest declines have been recorded among Asian-Pacific Islanders (64 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (63 percent). API teens currently have the lowest birth rate overall (9.7 per 1,000), while Hispanic teens have the highest rate among the racial groups (46.3 percent). Still, the rate for Hispanic teens has fallen the fastest since 2007 (39 percent), and the CDC notes that the birth rates across most racial and Hispanic ethnicity groups is narrowing, as the following chart shows: Uneven declines across the states States have taken different approaches to reducing teen births, with differing results. Every state has seen a decline since 1991, but rates continue to be lowest in the Northeastern states and higher in the South. New England states all had teen birth rates under 20 per 1,000, with New Hampshire's the lowest at 13.8. Eight states had rates above 40 per 1,000, with New Mexico recording the highest at 47.5. The District of Columbia joined four states in seeing declines of more than 60 percent since 1991. The United States could do better The good news for America is somewhat tempered by the fact that our teen birth rate still ranks among some of the highest for developed countries. While countries like Denmark, Switzerland and Japan recorded teen birth rates under 5 per 1,000, the United States finds itself among seven of 31 countries highlighted by the CDC with rates exceeding 20 births per 1,000 teens. What the U.S. progress means Though the United States lags behind other countries, the CDC says the progress made since 1991 has amounted to 4 million fewer teen births. Citing research from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, the CDC says this also saved taxpayers an estimated $12 billion alone in 2010 from costs associated with government-funded health care, child welfare and higher incarceration rates for the children of teen moms. And having fewer babies born to teen mothers, the CDC points out, is good for other reasons. Teen motherhood comes with a higher health risk for the baby, educational limits for the mother and limited resources, since about 90 percent of teen births are to unmarried mothers. And babies born to teen mothers are more likely to eventually become teen mothers themselves. Correction: An earlier version of this story said teenage mothers had higher incarceration rates. It's actually the children of teenage mothers with higher incarceration rates.	194	"[{""start"": 381, ""end"": 507, ""text"": ""The CDC attributes the 20-year decline to decreased sexual activity among teens, as well as more frequent use of contraception"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	203	2023-03-23T15:27:13.353101Z	2023-03-23T15:27:13.353199Z	488.873
The 15-year-old girl blushed when she explained the most important parts of her day to the instructor. “I’m glad because I got good news today,” she said, as she averted her eyes from the other ninth- and 10th-graders sitting in a circle. “I’m sad, because I’m afraid my mom might find out.” “Ohh,” the instructor, Reyna Trinidad, replied. “You’re in love.” Trinidad and her co-instructor, Jonathan Bibb, have gathered this group of 10 Latino students at Wheaton High School after classes to aid them on their journey of self-actualization. On this cold March day, a simple question — Como estas, tu? — would open another week of discussions about listening to emotions, having a sense of self-worth and handling the feelings that can make an adolescent’s cheeks redden. They hope these sessions will help fix a stubborn problem affecting some of the region’s most affluent suburbs: the great disparity in birthrates between Latino teenagers and other groups. For every 1,000 adolescent females in Montgomery County, an estimated 23 Latinas between 15 and 17 give birth. Even as the Latino birthrate has fallen in Montgomery over the past two decades, it remains more than 2.5 times higher than the rate for the county’s black girls in that age group and more than three times the rate for white girls. Similarly high rates are found in Alexandria. They are presumed to be similar in Fairfax County, officials there said, even though the county’s health department does not parse birthrate data for Hispanics. Since 1996, the earliest year in which Montgomery officials have published data, the great disparity between birthrates for Latino and white teenagers has hardly changed. Meanwhile, the gap between black teenagers and Latino teenagers has increased. This has perplexed local officials at a time when teen pregnancy rates in the nation are plummeting and the gaps between all races and ethnic groups continue to shrink. For advocates, the disparity has come to symbolize the socioeconomic gulf between Latinos, largely a population of new immigrants, and more established populations in one of the country’s most affluent counties. “If the gap between Latino and other groups continues to widen in terms of teen pregnancy rates, we can expect the cycle of poverty to continue in these communities, in addition to other negative consequences for the children and higher economic costs for taxpayers,” said Diego Uriburu, the co-chairman of Montgomery’s Latino Youth Collaborative Oversight Committee and director of the nonprofit Identity. In 2011, Identity and the social services agency Mary’s Center began using an annual $1 million federal grant for a coed, bilingual pregnancy prevention curriculum tailored to Latino youths, part of a national push to invest in teen pregnancy prevention. The program is held at 12 schools in Montgomery, including Wheaton High. Working with professors from the George Washington University School of Public Health, they are trying to scientifically measure the program’s success. The first results will be available later this year. The partnership is trying to test whether holistic discussions using examples germane to the experiences of being a Latino in Montgomery will delay “the sexual debut” of Latino girls and boys. So, yes, there will be discussions in the sessions about condom use and birth control. But first, there is discussion about the difference between an avocado and an orange. Playing catch-up The orange, Trinidad and Bibb remind them, might look gorgeous on the outside. Still, it will collapse under pressure. The avocado, though, might look bruised. But the core — its “pit” — remains strong and untarnished. “Always remember your pit,’’ Trinidad tells the group. “That is the person who you are, your inner self.” Meanwhile, researchers and nonprofit groups are trying to discover the core of disparity in Montgomery. When Genevieve Martinez- Garcia, now a senior researcher at the Healthy Teens Network, studied Montgomery’s Latino youth in the mid-2000s, the birthrate was nearly twice what it is today. Those teenagers were a part of the wave of immigration from Central America that transformed the makeup of some cities in Montgomery, such as Wheaton. The pregnancy rates in that age group began to fall as those young people became more likely to take sexual education in schools, she said. “But what I found is that there needed to be more than sexual education,’’ Martinez-Garcia said. “You have to look at what’s going on in the kid’s life. Where they live, go to school and where they play matters. Having two-parent households matters.” Even so, Latina teenagers in the county are far less likely to get pregnant when compared with the national average of an estimated 46.9 births to Latina girls for every thousand adolescent girls. But those averages have fallen so rapidly that there is now only a slight difference between the rate for Latinas and blacks, while nationally, the gap between Latinas and whites has decreased. Bill Albert, chief program officer at the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, called the declines “one of the nation’s great success stories of the past two decades,” a result of “a magic combination of less sex and more contraception.” Still, he said, “only in the past several years has the sex education business caught up with [educating] Latinos.” In Montgomery, the gap remains more outstanding because Latino youths are more likely to live in impoverished areas than white teenagers in the county, Martinez-Garcia said. The poverty rate for Latinos is nearly four times higher than it is for whites, county data show. They are also more likely to live in households with less-traditional family structures. For example, teenagers frequently live with extended family while a parent lives in Central America, leading to less supervision at home. Pressuring young girls In focus groups, Martinez- Garcia said, she began to notice that young girls were often dating boys who were two or three years older. Those older teenagers were pressuring the girls into sex, Martinez-Garcia said, leading to girls losing their virginity as early as 12. Meanwhile, some held on to myths that birth control might cause cancer. “A disturbingly high number of them had an early initial sexual debut,” Martinez-Garcia said. “And the parents were not giving them the skills or the self-esteem to say ‘No.’ ” This program doesn’t pitch itself to teens as a pregnancy prevention program. Instead, students volunteer for the camaraderie and the planned camping trip. “I joined because my friends told me how fun it was,” said Aristides Garcia, 15. “And, I don’t mean to be racist, but it’s good to spend some time with other Latinos because it is a way to feel more comfortable when talking about things.” So they gather for nearly two hours after school, sitting around a table drinking water and eating chips and salsa. They warm up playing games of “Huggy Bear.” At this session, instructors conducted exercises about listening to others and how frustrating it is to not be heard. Bibb then glided the conversation into another type of listening. “What do you think happens when you don’t listen to your pit?” Bibb asked. “You won’t be happy,” Wendy Flores, 15, volunteered. “And when you don’t listen, maybe sometimes you make the wrong decision.” Then the two facilitators handed out three scenarios about fictional teens in situations all too real. All three were from countries in Central America living with either one parent or no parents at all. All three were in relationships, one of them secret, in which the girlfriend was younger than her boyfriend. Each of the scenarios ended in pregnancy. Working in pairs, the teenagers tried to figure out how they might feel in the situation. “Seventeen is okay to have a kid, if [the father is] working,” Aristides said. “But not with a 16-year-old. That’s too young.” “I guess he’d be happy for bringing a life into this world, but how could he afford the child?” said Steven Villacorta, 15. “He has no money.” As the program goes on, the facilitators have deeper discussions about pregnancy and sexuality. But they said the first step was to have the group learn to make decision on their own. “This is really tough,” added Wendy, who said she needed more time to figure everything out. “I joined to meet new people and make friends. But I’m learning about how to think for myself, and how to be me.”	193	"[{""start"": 2548, ""end"": 2802, ""text"": ""In 2011, Identity and the social services agency Mary’s Center began using an annual $1 million federal grant for a coed, bilingual pregnancy prevention curriculum tailored to Latino youths, part of a national push to invest in teen pregnancy prevention."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3274, ""end"": 3359, ""text"": ""o, yes, there will be discussions in the sessions about condom use and birth contro"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4232, ""end"": 4371, ""text"": ""The pregnancy rates in that age group began to fall as those young people became more likely to take sexual education in schools, she said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5204, ""end"": 5273, ""text"": ""a result of “a magic combination of less sex and more contraception.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 8088, ""end"": 8271, ""text"": ""As the program goes on, the facilitators have deeper discussions about pregnancy and sexuality.

She was 15 and adrift. Her mother long dead. Her father otherwise occupied — he did not seem to notice when one of the young men who hung out in his corner market playing Street Fighter took an interest in her. Or that the interest was mutual. She could not say that this video game player was particularly good-looking, but he was 19, did not speak of women as conquests and when he flirted with her he used her childhood nickname, “China,” instead of her given name of Arlin. “I liked the way he said ‘Chee-na,'” she says. “He used sweet words like beautiful. He said he liked my smile and my eyes.” She started sneaking out at night to see him, down the stairwell outside her room, into the alley, where he waited to take her to his house or a friend’s house. She did not love him, but was curious. They hung out for three months before having sex and, she says, it happened maybe three or four times before she moved, leaving behind her video game Valentino for high school in Aurora, Colo. She had already started picturing graduation and life as someone her dad would be proud of, a detective, maybe. “When the doctor said I was pregnant, I couldn’t stop crying,” she says. “I was just really scared, you know.” The video game player has never held the son she later bore. In the weeks it took Arlin Rueda to move from panic to fear and back again, she decided a few things. First, she would not have an abortion. Second, she didn’t think she could go through nine months of pregnancy without growing attached to the baby to be born, so adoption was out. Third, she did not want to become pregnant again. So, the teenager made a choice, one that underscores a profound public policy shift in the family planning landscape in Colorado. After Rueda delivered her son, but before she left the hospital, she had a contraceptive implant placed in her upper left arm. There are two key points in that last sentence. The first is that Rueda chose what is called long-acting reversible contraception. The second is when she chose to start that contraception. Right now national attention is on the first point. For good reason. Between 2007 and 2012, Colorado saw the highest percentage drop in birth rates among teens 15 to 19 in the country, according to a report released today by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. During that time, its teen birth rates dropped 39 percent compared to 29 percent nationwide. Abortion rates in the state among teens fell 35 percent between 2009 and 2012 and are falling nationally, as well. The CDC’s report comes on the heels of Colorado’s own study, which reported a 40 percent decline in births among teens 15 to 19 from 2009 to 2013. The stunning decline in teen birth rates is significant not just for its size, but for its explanation. State public health officials are crediting a sustained, focused effort to offer low-income women free or low-cost long-acting reversible contraception, that is, intrauterine devices or implants. The Colorado Family Planning Initiative, supported by a $23 million anonymous donation, provided more than 30,000 IUDs or implants to women served by the state’s 68 family-planning clinics. The state’s analysis suggests the initiative was responsible for three-quarters of the decline in the state’s teen birth rates. Public health officials there and elsewhere long have argued the use of long-acting reversible contraception can dramatically reduce the number of unintended pregnancies –– which make up a majority of teen pregnancies. Colorado’s initiative built upon a somewhat similar effort in St. Louis, Mo., which educated about 7,500 sexually-active women on various forms of contraception and then offered to pay for that contraception over the next three years. Seventy percent of women in the Missouri study chose an IUD or implant. The conclusion: those who chose short-term methods such as the pill or the patch were 20 times more likely to have an unintended pregnancy than those who used an IUD or an implant. “If you have a drug that is 20 times more effective than other drugs, you will always start with that as your first option,” says Greta Klingler, family planning supervisor for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. “What we did (in the Colorado Family Planning Initiative) is kind of flip the mindset, so rather than introducing all contraception as being on the same playing field, we said, ‘Let’s start with what is most effective.'” **** Colorado’s part of a larger national trend: teen birth rates have been falling steadily in the country for decades, save a few isolated spikes. Since 1991, the decline has been especially pronounced (63 percent) for African American teens age 15 to 19, according to a survey and study of teen births from 1940 to 2013 released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. But from 2007 to 2013, the birth rate among Hispanic teens fell the most – 44 percent. That would account for some of the dramatic declines seen in places with larger Latino populations such as Arizona, Colorado and California, says Stephanie Ventura, lead author of the National Vital Statistics report. “The dynamic has changed so much for all groups, in all states. It’s just really across the board,” she says. “I think it’s the biggest public health success story in recent years.” Among the reasons given for the falling rates: teens waiting longer to have intercourse, increased use of contraception and, the report posits, the recession likely played some role in holding down recent teen birth rates as it did among all other women under 40. Buried amid the headlines in Colorado is more welcome news. The state also saw a 50 percent drop in repeat pregnancies among teens. With a second child, the already-high odds are ratcheted up that a low-income mother will not finish high school, remain trapped at the low-paying end of the economic ladder and reliant upon public assistance. (You, taxpayer, may read this as ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.) Rueda did not need statistics to understand all this. Her life was already hard. So, she kept her contraceptive implant until it expired three years later. But when she had it removed, she did not replace it. She was in a new relationship by then, her first real one, and living with her boyfriend and his parents. ‘I just thought, “I’ll take care of myself with pills.’ But, yeah, it didn’t happen.” She became pregnant. She was scared, she says, but she also was with someone she loved and with a family that treated her like a daughter. She was not thinking ahead. *** The difference between short-term and long-term birth control isn’t just method. It’s mindset. “With an implant or an IUD, if someone wants it out, we take it out, but once it’s in and they have to make an appointment to take it out, they really have to think, ‘OK, do I want a baby now, really?'” says Dr. Stephanie Teal, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s medical director of Family Planning.  “As opposed to the pill, you basically have to decide every single day, ‘Do I want to be not pregnant?’ And some days, you might want to be pregnant.” And that makes short-term birth control particularly ineffective for adolescents, says Dr. Stephen Scott, associate professor in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Colorado’s School of Medicine and director of the Colorado Adolescent Maternity Program (CAMP). CAMP provides not only medical care, but mental health, nutrition and a social worker to low-income mothers and their babies. “They oftentimes are not thinking about the future,” Scott says. “Cognitively they are still developing. They’re in and out of relationships. They aren’t necessarily motivated to be pregnant, but they aren’t necessarily motivated not to become pregnant.” And this is the second part of the long-acting reversible contraception course Colorado has been charting: Timing. Several years ago, CAMP offered 396 of its pregnant adolescent mothers who wanted birth control a choice: They could have an implant inserted after they gave birth, but before they left the hospital. Or, they could wait the typical six weeks and then start any form of contraception they wished.  Not quite half – 171 — chose the immediate post-partum implant at the hospital. The remaining 225 chose the later start  —  some much later — though by year’s end nearly all were on some form of birth control, including IUDs or implants. Of the mothers who chose the immediate post-partum implant, only 2.6 percent became pregnant again within a year– and that’s because they had their implants removed. Among those who chose the delayed start, 20 percent got pregnant again within the first year. By the end of the second year, Teal says, eight percent of moms who chose the post-partum implant were pregnant again. But among that second group? Forty-six percent were pregnant again. Presented with those findings, the state last year expanded its Medicaid coverage to allow for reimbursement of immediate post-partum long-acting reversible contraception. South Carolina, New Mexico, California and New York have also approved a similar policy change, Teal says. Rueda is a CAMP mother. After giving birth to her daughter, she again chose have an implant inserted before she left the hospital. “My daughter is beautiful, but I wanted to do something in life. Before I got pregnant, I thought, ‘I need to be someone in life.’ But I failed. I mean what I wanted to be, I don’t know how it can be. It’s just feels impossible.” Her relationship with the baby’s father, a house painter, is rocky at the moment, but they’re working on it. “I can’t imagine having a third child. Right now, I’m working. I’m going to school to get my GED, but I’m going to have to struggle to give my children a future.” She is now 20. She had her baby girl two months ago. The space between her children? Roughly the three-year life span of her implant.	192	"[{""start"": 2825, ""end"": 3020, ""text"": ""tate public health officials are crediting a sustained, focused effort to offer low-income women free or low-cost long-acting reversible contraception, that is, intrauterine devices or implants."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3021, ""end"": 3209, ""text"": ""e Colorado Family Planning Initiative, supported by a $23 million anonymous donation, provided more than 30,000 IUDs or implants to women served by the state’s 68 family-planning clinic"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3209, ""end"": 3337, ""text"": "".

Women with little or no health insurance would be eligible for free, long-lasting birth control under a program proposed by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). Announced by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) at a community college in Alexandria on Friday, the $9 million federal grant would cover intrauterine devices and skin implants as well as outreach to eligible women, training for clinicians and a study of the program’s impact. “This is all about educating and empowering women to decide when and if they become pregnant,” Northam, a pediatric neurologist, said at Northern Virginia Community College. “When women have access to this contraception, they choose on their own time when to start a family.” Northam, who is running for governor in 2017, has been pushing for such a program for months. He wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post in August on the issue and argued for expanded access to birth control during a Brookings Institution event in October. On Friday, he pointed to a similar program in Colorado that led to a 40 percent decline in the birthrate among teens between 2009 and 2013. The Colorado governor’s office said the state saved $42.5 million in health-care expenditures associated with teens giving birth and the abortion rate for 15- to 19-year-olds in participating counties fell 35 percent. The devices would be distributed through Department of Health centers across the state. There is no requirement in Virginia for minors to have parental consent before having a contraceptive device implanted. “It’s going to help women, and it’s also going to help the Commonwealth of Virginia economically,” Northam, a pediatric neurosurgeon, said of the program. Although it relies on federal funds, the contraceptive program requires the approval of Virginia’s legislature, now controlled by Republicans, before it can be launched. A spokesman for the Virginia House and Senate said lawmakers would review the proposal as part of the budget process. This year’s legislative session begins Jan. 13. Northam said that reducing teen pregnancies and teen abortions is a bipartisan goal. “The less unintended pregnancies we have in the Commonwealth of Virginia, the better, and also, the less abortions that we have, the better.” But he also acknowledged that Republicans may not agree with this approach. In 2011, then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) cut funding for teen-pregnancy prevention programs that provided sex education and birth control. A year later, the legislature passed a bill that would have required transvaginal ultrasounds for women seeking abortions. It was ultimately killed amid backlash against the invasive procedure. Conservative religious groups in Colorado have opposed that state’s program. “I remind all women in the Commonwealth of Virginia that a group of legislators, most of whom are men, shouldn’t be telling women what they should and shouldn’t do with their bodies,” Northam said — the only explicitly political note struck by the soft-spoken lieutenant governor. The small crowd of local politicians, health-care providers and advocates applauded. “Certain people are going to notice” the budget request, state Sen. Barbara A. Favola (D-Arlington) said after the event. Opposition to birth-control distribution on the grounds that it will encourage teenagers to have sex, she said, was “naively based and ill-informed. . . . Teenagers make decisions in the heat of the moment, and whether they have access to birth control or not doesn’t factor in.” Several counties in Northern Virginia have already received private grants to expand long-lasting contraceptive access. Stephen A. Haering, director of the Alexandria Health Department, said that IUD or implant use among patients has increased dramatically since its program began in 2013 — from 15 that year to 77 in 2015. The vast majority of women who come to their family planning clinic, he said, are uninsured, and without the federal money continuing the program would be difficult.	191	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 158, ""text"": ""n with little or no health insurance would be eligible for free, long-lasting birth control under a program proposed by Virginia Gov.

Fertility rates in the United States are continuing their decades-long decline, due in large part to a steep slide in teenage pregnancies down to historic lows, according to a new government report released Thursday. The National Center for Health Statistics said the pregnancy rate of 102 pregnancies out of every 1,000 women is 12 percent below the 1990 peak of about 116 per 1,000. Only once in the past 30 years, 1997, has it been lower, and only marginally, the center said. Since 1990, the report said, pregnancy rates are down in almost every category. The only exception is among women over 30, whose pregnancy rate has increased steadily with every passing year. But the rate is declining among women in their 20s, who form the single largest group of pregnant women, and among teenagers of all races and ethnicities. The abortion rate also has dropped, reflecting a continuous slide since peaking in 1990. The report only examined the trajectory of pregnancy rates through 2009, stopping there because more recent data on abortions is not available yet. But newer statistics on birth rates suggest the decline is continuing, though not as quickly as it did in recent years when the recession accelerated trends well underway. Women already were having fewer children than women of their parents’ and grandparents’ generations, so those under 30 could postpone childbirth until the economy improved without affecting their longstanding goals of having a first or second child. “What happened was a postponement of births among younger women with a longer time horizon,” said Andrew Cherlin, a Johns Hopkins University sociologist specializing in family issues. “Women over 30 couldn’t wait that much longer.” While the decelerating decline in birth rates since 2009 reflects the easing of the recession’s impact, the striking drop in teenage pregnancies shows little sign of abating. The teen pregnancy rate in 2009, of about 38 per thousand girls, was 39 percent lower than the 1991 peak of 62. Just four years later, in 2012, it reached a record low of about 29. Sally Curtin, one of the report’s authors, said the historic drop is being driven by a long, downward trend of fewer teenagers having sex, and among those who do, a sharp increase in their use of contraceptives. “It’s as if both sides in the debate over teen pregnancy were right,” said Cherlin, noting that concerns over the AIDS epidemic may have played a role in the growing use of condoms among teenage boys. “AIDS has forced many school districts to talk about contraception, even if they didn’t want to,” he said. The national trends are evident in the Washington area. Teenage pregnancy rates have plummeted in the District, down to less than a quarter of where they were two decades ago, said Brenda Rhodes Miller, director of the DC Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. In 1993, the pregnancy rate for teenagers aged 15 to 19 was about 239 per 1,000. By 2011, it was under 55. “The decline has been amazing,” she said, adding that the reasons for it are not clear. Teen pregnancy rates are declining in every ward, she said, though more slowly in wards 7 and 8, which have the city’s lowest income levels. More than 500 of the 879 births to District teens in 2011 were to residents of those two wards. The one-year drop was relatively small. In more affluent wards, the teen pregnancy rate dropped by double digit percentages. Even with declining pregnancy rates, the United States still has one of the highest overall birth rates among industrialized countries. The 10 nations with the highest birth rates in the world are all in Africa.	190	"[{""start"": 2074, ""end"": 2285, ""text"": ""Sally Curtin, one of the report’s authors, said the historic drop is being driven by a long, downward trend of fewer teenagers having sex, and among those who do, a sharp increase in their use of contraceptives."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2287, ""end"": 2485, ""text"": ""It’s as if both sides in the debate over teen pregnancy were right,” said Cherlin, noting that concerns over the AIDS epidemic may have played a role in the growing use of condoms among teenage boys"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2488, ""end"": 2593, ""text"": ""AIDS has forced many school districts to talk about contraception, even if they didn’t want to,” he said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2650, ""end"": 2850, ""text"": ""eenage pregnancy rates have plummeted in the District, down to less than a quarter of where they were two decades ago, said Brenda Rhodes Miller, director of the DC Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2287, ""end"": 2485, ""text"": ""It’s as if both sides in the debate over teen pregnancy were right,” said Cherlin, noting that concerns over the AIDS epidemic may have played a role in the growing use of condoms among teenage boys"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	199	2023-03-23T14:43:31.246379Z	2023-03-23T14:43:31.246571Z	289.317
Dramatically fewer black high school students are taking part in sexual behavior that puts them at risk for contracting HIV than they were 20 years ago. However, those students still engage in more risky behavior than their white and Hispanic counterparts. Meanwhile, teens overall continue to engage in risky behaviors at rates that have declined only slightly over the past two decades, according to an analysis released Tuesday by U.S. government researchers. More specifically, 46 percent of U.S. high school students in 2011 reported ever having sex, compared to 54 percent in 1991. The percentage of students reporting having had four or more sex partners was 14 percent in 2011, down from 19 percent 20 years earlier. The rates in both categories for Hispanic students barely changed over two decades. “The overall plateau [among all students] is troubling,” said Laura Kann, senior scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who released the mixed findings at the International AIDS Conference in Washington. Four of every 10 new HIV infections occur in people younger than 30, according to the CDC. So reducing risky sexual behavior during teenage years is key. The average age when teens begin to have sex is 16, researchers said. The findings come from the government’s long-standing survey of high school students’ health, which includes sexual behavior. The data do not include information on family income and education, which are known to influence risky behavior in teenagers. But researchers said one possible reason for the encouraging news about black high school students could be investments in sexual education and HIV prevention efforts in schools. Black students were the only group to report a steady increase in percentages of youth taking HIV education classes, rising to 87 percent in 2011 from 84 percent in 1991, Kann said. Overall, the number of U.S. high school students who have been taught about HIV and received sexual education in schools over the past decade has declined steadily due to budget cutbacks. The data also showed that sexually active black students were the most likely to use a condom in their most recent sexual encounter at 65 percent, but that is a drop from a high of 70 percent in 1999. Young black men who are gay or bisexual are especially vulnerable and at high risk for HIV and need to be the focus of prevention, said Kevin Fenton, director of CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Prevention. Unless improvements are made, according to research presented Monday, more than half of all black men younger than 30 who are gay or bisexual will be infected with HIV within the next decade. The research suggests that black youth are benefiting from school-based education about HIV, but once they leave the school environment, gay and bisexual youth enter a high-risk environment where HIV prevalence is high. Having sex with partners who are also black, and older, poses risks and helps spread the virus. “We are at a pivotal moment in HIV prevention,” Fenton said. There is growing hope of achieving an AIDS-free generation here at home in America, he said, but keeping young people safe is essential to reaching that goal.	189	"[{""start"": 1516, ""end"": 1693, ""text"": ""But researchers said one possible reason for the encouraging news about black high school students could be investments in sexual education and HIV prevention efforts in schools"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	198	2023-03-23T14:38:23.772054Z	2023-03-23T14:38:23.772348Z	1293.09
Colorado’s teen birth rate plummeted 40 percent between 2009 and 2013. Since 2009, the state has provided 30,000 contraceptive implants or intrauterine devices (IUDs) at low or no cost to low-income women at 68 family-planning clinics across Colorado through the Colorado Family Planning Initiative. The effort was funded by a five-year commitment of $23 million from an anonymous donor. At participating clinics, the percentage of young women receiving IUDs or implants quadrupled, according to a press release from Gov. John Hickenlooper (D). The state attributes three-quarters of the overall decline in the Colorado teen birthrate to the program and said its success had a ripple effect. With fewer unplanned pregnancies, the teen abortion rate fell by 35 percent between 2009 and 2012 in those counties where the initiative is in place. The state also spent less on food programs for low-income mothers and children; infant enrollment in WIC supplemental nutrition program declined 23 percent between 2008 and 2013. The governor’s office said the state saved $42.5 million in health-care expenditures associated with teen births. For every dollar spent on the contraceptives, the state saved $5.68 in Medicaid costs, according to the Denver Post. Liz Romer, a family-planning nurse at Children’s Hospital Colorado, told the BBC an IUD normally costs between $500 and several thousand dollars. She said that’s cost prohibitive to teens who don’t have the money themselves and feel they can’t ask their parents to pay. “It needs to be readily available, the same day, and it needs to be free,” she said. But conservative religious groups disagree. Carrie Gordon Earll, senior director of public policy for the conservative Christian ministry Focus on the Family, told the Denver Post she was skeptical of the state’s claim that increased access to contraception caused the decline in birthrates. “What we have seen over many years is that access to contraception does not equal fewer unintended pregnancies and fewer abortions,” Earll said. “Availability of contraception leads to increased sexual activity, which leads to unintended pregnancies and abortions.” Bob Enyart, a spokesman for Colorado Right to Life, told the BBC offering contraception to teens sends the message that you can “have all the sex you want.” “When you teach children that they’re animals — that they have evolved from pigs and dogs and apes — then they act like animals,” Enyart said. Dainzu Mosqueda Salinas works for the Boulder Valley Women’s Health Center. She came to the clinic in 2010 as a teenager to get contraception. “One of my friends from school had an unplanned pregnancy, and at the time I was studying and was not looking to be pregnant,” Salinas told the BBC. Colorado’s success is encouraging, but not every state has an anonymous millionaire willing to fund such a campaign. It’s not clear yet what will happen to Colorado’s program when the fortuitous funding stream runs out in 2015. However, a Colorado public health department spokesman told CNN the initiative is a useful model for family-planning coverage under the Affordable Care Act. “By showing the effectiveness of long-acting, reversible contraceptives, we’re providing the evidence needed for health plans … to cover family planning services,” the spokesman said.

"The IUD and other long-acting reversible contraceptive methods are making a major resurgence in the United States — and recent studies indicate they're contributing to the lowest abortion rate in three decades. A new study this week found Iowa's efforts to expand access to long-acting contraceptive methods led to fewer abortions, even as abortion clinics in the state increased. Cost and education still remain a barrier to further adoption of these highly effective birth control methods. But as I wrote earlier this year, another major study found expanding access to these contraceptive methods would help lower rates of teen births and abortions in the United States. Earlier this week, an influential pediatrics group offered a pretty significant new recommendation: that teenagers use long-acting contraceptives, like intrauterine devices and hormone implants, as the ""first line"" of defense in preventing pregnancy pregnancy. And a new study released Wednesday night helps illustrate why the physicians group offered its endorsement. Teenage girls who were offered these types of contraceptives at no cost were significantly much more likely to use them, and they had substantially lower rates of pregnancy, birth and abortion when compared to U.S. teens, according to the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. Just about 4.5 percent of U.S. teens between 15-19 report using long-acting contraceptive methods, which have a much lower fail rate under typical use (less than 1 percent) when compared to birth control pills (9 percent) and male condoms (18 percent), according to the CDC. The costs can be prohibitive, though. Without insurance, an IUD could cost more than $1,000 for a one-time insertion. But removing financial and educational barriers to accessing these forms of birth control increased their usage, according to the NEJM study, which holds pretty major implications for the U.S. teen birth rate that — despite hitting record lows last year — is still 5.5 times higher than the rate in Western Europe and trails the rest of the developed world. For the study, researchers at Washington University in Saint Louis provided free contraception to thousands of local women through the CHOICE Contraceptive Project. They were given their choice of method after being informed of effectiveness rates, potential side effects and the risks and benefits of each. Of the 1,404 teens in the NEJM study spanning 2007 to 2011, 74 percent chose long-acting methods — more than 16 times the reported rate of usage for U.S. teenage women. The results were pretty stark. Teens in the CHOICE program, when compared to the national average, were five times less likely to get pregnant or give birth, and they were about four times less likely to have an abortion. The average annual birth rate in the CHOICE group — in which three-quarters used a long-acting contraceptive — was 19.4 per 1,000 teens, which was 36 percent lower than the CDC's 2015 goal of 30.3 per 1,000 teens. And two-thirds of teens in the CHOICE program who chose a long-acting method were still using it after two years, much better than the rate for those using a different method (one-third). The NEJM study also comes just months after Colorado reported a state health initiative reduced the teen birth rate by 40 percent over five years by providing IUDs and other implantable devices to low-income women. That program was funded by an anonymous donor, so it's not the kind of thing that could be easily recreated across the country. Notably, though, the Affordable Care Act requires most health plans to provide no-cost birth control, which is at the heart of the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision and still-pending religious challenges to the law's contraceptive coverage mandate. Even though use of long-acting contraceptives is still low among U.S. teens, the researchers note that it has increased from less than 1 percent in 2002. ""Our study suggests that it is possible to achieve a much greater rate of use,"" they wrote.

Open communication between parents and teens about sexual behavior can be uncomfortable for both sides. But do these talks make a difference in adolescents’ awareness and use of safer sexual practices? THIS STUDY analyzed data from 52 studies, spanning three decades and including 25,314 adolescents, who averaged 15 years old. Those who talked to their parents about sex were more likely to report avoiding risky sex and using contraceptives and condoms than were teens who did not. This was especially true for girls and for teens who talked about sex with their mother rather than their father. The findings did not differ by the youths’ age or ethnicity. WHO MAY BE AFFECTED? Teens. Young people make up about a fourth of the U.S population that is sexually active but account for almost half of all sexually transmitted infections. They are also at heightened risk for unintended pregnancy. Among high school students, nearly half report having had sex. CAVEATS The study did not have data on such details as when parent-teen talks took place, specifically what was said or how it was communicated, so it did not assess whether these factors made a difference. Data came exclusively from teens and did not include information from parents. FIND THIS STUDY Nov. 2 online issue of JAMA Pediatrics (www.jamapediatrics.com; click on “Online First”).

"The sex life of the American teenager is apparently far less busy than it was in generations past. Less than half of teens older than 14 said they’ve had intercourse, a sharp drop from rates in the '80s, a new CDC study found. The majority of those who do choose to become sexually active are using some form of protection. And, in the last decade, the popularity of the so-called ""morning-after pill"" among girls has more than doubled. Teen births, meanwhile, have plummeted about 57 percent over the last 30 years. Researchers surveyed roughly 2,000 boys and girls, 15 to 19. (They also interviewed about 1,770 young adults, 20 to 24, about their high school encounters.) The share of teen girls who reported they've had sex at least once dropped from 51 percent in 1988 to 44 percent in 2013, they found. Abstinence was more pronounced among the guys: 60 percent of teen boys in 1988 said they’d had sex, compared to 47 percent in 2013. Much of the decline for both boys and girls occurred between 1988 and the period of 2006-2010, and numbers have held steady since then. Crotchety adults may joke: Maybe they’re too busy messing with their iPhones. That’s actually a decent theory, said Dr. Brooke Bokor, an Adolescent Medicine Specialist at the Children's National Health System. More teenagers than ever have smartphones, including those with no traditional computers at home. Many are more comfortable searching in private for credible information about sexual health, she said. They could be better educated about the risks -- and more mentally prepared before that first heated moment ever comes. “They’re looking on the web,” Bokor said. “They’re looking for guidance from parents, guardians and physicians. They can and will make positive decisions for their own health, both sexual and otherwise. We really need to be prepared to treat our youth and young adults as educated consumers.” One good example, she said: The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a private non-profit organization runs Bedsider.org. This week’s featured articles include “Not awkward: 5 tips for talking to anyone about sex” and “the HPV vaccine, which is now widely offered to boys and girls as young as 11. The shots, of course, come with an educational conversation. Kids learn earlier about the prevalence of STIs and how they're spread. (Contrary to some parents' worries, research shows the advent of Gardisil did not spark an upswing of sexual recklessness among tweens.) ""They learn from doctors that you can catch HPV even if you use a condom,"" Bokor said, emphasizing some common conditions spread through skin-to-skin contact. ""They might think: How else can I stay healthy?"" The majority of kids these days use some form of contraception, the CDC data shows. The use of emergency contraception -- like the Plan B pill -- for teen girls grew from 8 percent in 2002 to 22 percent in 2013. But teenagers still aren’t using the most effective forms of contraception: 97 percent of teen girls opt for condoms over birth control pills and the IUD. The withdrawal method also appears to be pretty common: The survey data also provides a window into when first times are most likely to happen:   Girls who reported using some form of protection during their first sexual encounter were half as likely to become teen moms than those who did not, the CDC reported. That suggests birth control has played a key role in curbing teen parenthood. Births to girls 15 to 19 plunged from 84 per 1,000 teens in 1991 t0 26 in 2013."	184	"[{""start"": 324, ""end"": 435, ""text"": ""nd, in the last decade, the popularity of the so-called \""morning-after pill\"" among girls has more than doubled"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 808, ""end"": 938, ""text"": ""bstinence was more pronounced among the guys: 60 percent of teen boys in 1988 said they’d had sex, compared to 47 percent in 2013"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 674, ""end"": 807, ""text"": ""The share of teen girls who reported they've had sex at least once dropped from 51 percent in 1988 to 44 percent in 2013, they found."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1076, ""end"": 1153, ""text"": ""Crotchety adults may joke: Maybe they’re too busy messing with their iPhones."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2782, ""end"": 2909, ""text"": ""The use of emergency contraception -- like the Plan B pill -- for teen girls grew from 8 percent in 2002 to 22 percent in 2013."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3378, ""end"": 3455, ""text"": ""That suggests birth control has played a key role in curbing teen parenthood."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2044, ""end"": 2134, ""text"": ""This week’s featured articles include “Not awkward: 5 tips for talking to anyone about sex"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2044, ""end"": 2134, ""text"": ""This week’s featured articles include “Not awkward: 5 tips for talking to anyone about sex"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1076, ""end"": 1153, ""text"": ""Crotchety adults may joke: Maybe they’re too busy messing with their iPhones."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	193	2023-03-23T12:43:49.814491Z	2023-03-23T12:43:49.814596Z	432.591
The Obama administration on Tuesday approved over-the-counter sales of the morning-after pill for age 15 and above, a move that contradicts a court order requiring the pill to be made available to women of all ages. While it fell short of that order, the administration’s move represents a historic liberalization of contraception rules — perhaps the most significant since the morning-after drug was approved 14 years ago. Today, Plan B is available to teenagers younger than 17 only with a prescription. Older women must request it from a pharmacist. In early April, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ordered the Food and Drug Administration to make Plan B available over the counter to all women. He gave the Obama administration until May 5 to appeal his decision. The FDA’s decision Tuesday, coming so close to that deadline and in conflict with Korman’s order, triggered confusion among women’s-health advocates. Some groups interpreted the FDA’s move as a precursor to an appeal. The Justice Department and the White House declined to comment on whether the Obama administration would challenge the ruling. “This triggers their intention to file an appeal even if they haven’t yet,” said National Women’s Law Center Vice President Judy Waxman. “This decision doesn’t comply with the judge’s ruling.” If the administration decides against an appeal, the FDA’s move Tuesday would become only symbolic. Women of all ages would soon gain access to the pill, which could be sold next to painkillers and toothpaste, though it could take weeks or months before the drug is on shelves. A legal fight would reignite a debate over whether young teens should be eligible to obtain emergency contraception without a doctor’s consent. In December 2011, the FDA concluded that the drug was safe for over-the-counter use among all women, but senior Obama administration officials overruled the agency’s scientists. Tuesday’s decision by the administration was seen by women’s advocates as an attempt to chart a middle ground, offering easy access to the pill to older teens but still restricting it for younger ones. “Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States,” FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg said in a statement. “The data reviewed by the agency demonstrated that women 15 years of age and older were able to understand how Plan B One-Step works, how to use it properly, and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease.” For more than a decade, Plan B has had a complex and politically divisive path toward obtaining federal approvals, marked by multiple resignations by senior staffers at the FDA and the creation of a complicated web of regulations around the contraceptive. In a 59-page ruling in April, Korman offered a scathing rebuke of the 2011 decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to bar over-the-counter sales of the pill to girls younger than 17. Korman called Sebelius’s decision “politically motivated, scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent.” Despite the potential for further legal wrangling over the drug, some reproductive rights advocates hailed the decision as a step forward, even as they pushed for expanding access to Plan B further. “This is an important step forward to expand access to emergency contraception and for preventing unintended pregnancy,” said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards. “While we fully support this expansion of access to birth control, we continue to believe that the administration should lift all unnecessary restrictions to emergency contraception.” The conservative Susan B. Anthony List criticized the decision late Tuesday. “The FDA is recklessly positioning itself as a parent to our children,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group’s president, said in a statement. “Fifteen year old girls need the protection that comes with the involvement of real parents and doctors in their lives.” Plan B has attracted controversy since it was approved as a prescription emergency contraceptive in 1999. Four years later, its manufacturer asked the FDA to make the drug available over the counter. The agency rejected that request, citing a lack of data on how it affects females younger than 16. Two FDA officials resigned in 2005 after the agency announced it would indefinitely postpone any further review of providing Plan B over the counter. Just a year later, the agency decided it would allow women older than 18 to purchase the drug over the counter. Teva Pharmaceuticals, which manufacturers Plan B One-Step, applied in February 2011 to sell the emergency contraceptive over the counter without any restriction on age. In December 2011, the FDA recommended that Teva’s application be approved and Plan B One-Step be made available for nonprescription use. At the time, President Obama said he was not involved in Sebelius’s decision to limit the over-the-counter sales. But he sympathized with it, saying that “as the father of two daughters, I think it is important for us to make sure that we apply some common sense to various rules when it comes to over-the-counter medicine.” HHS officials cited concerns about a lack of safety data for 12-year-old girls who might use the product. Teva subsequently submitted a new application to sell the emergency contraceptive to females 15 and older, FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Yao said. The FDA said its decision Tuesday was in response to that application and was unrelated to the existing litigation. Plan B is classified by the FDA as an emergency contraceptive and greatly reduces the chance of pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after intercourse. It differs from abortion drugs such as RU486, which are intended to terminate a pregnancy that has been established.	181	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 115, ""text"": ""a administration on Tuesday approved over-the-counter sales of the morning-after pill for age 15 and above,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 424, ""end"": 505, ""text"": ""oday, Plan B is available to teenagers younger than 17 only with a prescription."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2109, ""end"": 2301, ""text"": ""“Research has shown that access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States,” FDA Commissioner Margaret A."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5627, ""end"": 5775, ""text"": ""Plan B is classified by the FDA as an emergency contraceptive and greatly reduces the chance of pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after intercourse"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	192	2023-03-23T12:36:18.733092Z	2023-03-23T12:36:18.733202Z	644.464
American teens may be becoming more conservative about sex. According to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report reflecting data from 2011 to 2015, about 42 percent of girls and about 44 percent of boys ages 15-19 reported that they'd had sex. Both numbers continue a gradual decades-long decline: In 1988, 51 percent of girls and 60 percent of boys in the same age group answered affirmatively on the question of sexual activity. The latest report, published Thursday, is based on a nationally representative sample of about 4,100 teens. Eighty percent of them used contraception during their first sexual experience, it found. Previous studies on teens' sexual attitudes and behavior also reveal how today's teens differ from older brothers and sisters as well as parents who grew up in the more permissive 1970s and '80s. Teen pregnancy and birthrates have been falling since the early 1990s and reached a historic low in 2015. Public health experts credit a combination of widespread access to contraception, plus the decrease in the percentage of teens having sex.

In a perfect world, teenage girls would not have sex. (Nor would teenage boys.) But it’s not a perfect world. And even though a 15-year-old girl is too young to drink, smoke, vote or even see an R-rated movie legally, her body is more than capable of getting pregnant if she has unprotected sex. Tuesday the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Plan B, the morning-after pill, over-the-counter to girls age 15 and older who’ll have to show identification to prove their age. Previously, teens under 17 needed a prescription while women 17 and older had to ask for the drug from the pharmacist. The FDA’s move to make the morning-after pill more accessible is something of a compromise, however, and may only be a symbolic gesture. A U.S. District judge ordered the FDA in early April to make it available to all women, and the Obama administration was given until May 5 to file an appeal. If no appeal is filed, the court order stands and there’ll be no age restriction on who can purchase the drug. It’s important to note that Plan B, manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is emergency contraception and must be taken within 72 hours of having unprotected sex. It is not an abortion pill like RU-486 or mifepristone. Plan B prevents pregnancy by primarily delaying or stopping ovulation, while the so-called abortion pill is only given to someone after she has become pregnant. As expected, even in my circle of friends, the reaction to having the morning-after pill almost as accessible as a new toothbrush varied from outrage to approval. One who found it “appalling” admitted that she’s not an authority as she doesn’t have kids, but she pointed out, “Fifteen-year-olds are still children.” In fact, in most states the age of consent for sexual activity is around 16. But that doesn’t stop teens from having sex. I’ve survived the teenage years with a daughter. I’m lucky. We talked about these issues, as embarrassing as they were for both of us. I’m lucky, too, to be friends with other moms willing to discuss difficult topics. Many of my daughter’s friends were already on the birth control pill in high school — “for bad cramps” — which renders the availability of other birth control moot. I couldn’t help but wonder how many of those girls suffered that much each month, or whether it put parents’ minds at ease that their daughters were protected from an unwanted pregnancy. (Still have to have that talk about STDs, though.) Regardless, parents need to take responsibility for discussing sex — as in waiting to have sex, the consequences of having sex and safe sex practices — with their teenagers, both girls and boys. One friend, who supports the availability of Plan B, told me she worked hard with her daughters to encourage them to talk to her “if they had any questions or issues about anything.” Not every teenager has a supportive parent who remains vigilant, however. And for those teens who do engage in sex without birth control, or a method that fails, there is the option of the morning-after pill. It could keep a bad decision from becoming worse.

"The plunge in teenage birth rates to historic lows has been well-documented, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weighed in Tuesday with its own report on progress over the past 20 years. During that period, births to girls aged 15-19 dropped from 84.1 per 1,000 teens in 1991 t0 29.4 in 2012. That's very good news, and it shouldn't be minimized. But the CDC report issued Tuesday also contains some facts that should chill any parent buoyed by the overall results. The CDC's message Tuesday was that more than one-fourth of those children -- some 86,423, or 1,700 a week -- were born to girls aged 15 to 17 in 2012.  That represents a healthy decline of 63 percent in the past 21 years as well. But giving birth that young is associated with a variety of medical risks and emotional, social, and financial costs, including the likelihood that the mother will not finish high school or earn a GED. From there the information gets more troubling. I'll pick out a few nuggets for you: • Hispanics (25.5 births per 1,000 girls ), blacks (21.9), American Indians/Alaska Natives (17.0) are much more likely (emphasis mine) to give birth between the ages of 15 and 17 than whites (8.4) and Asians/Pacific Islanders (4.1). • There's a huge disparity in the birth rate among these youngsters across the country, from a high of 29 per 1,000 in Washington, D.C. to a low of 6.2 in New Hampshire. The report offers no reasons why, and in a telephone news conference, CDC officials said they didn't have enough information to draw conclusions. Kathryn Kost, a demographer for the Guttmacher Institute, which works on sexual and reproductive health issues, said that figure probably reflects a wide variety of factors including race, poverty, sex education, availability of contraception and abortion, attitudes toward giving birth at a young age and more. • Kids are using the least effective contraceptives. Only 1 percent used an IUD or hormonal implant the last time they had sex; 22.7 percent used nothing at all. Sixty-two percent used less effective methods such as condoms, cervical caps, sponges, the rhythm method, withdrawal and responses marked “other.” • Among sexually active teens in this age group, 83.3 percent did not receive formal sex education before the first time they had sex. That contrasts with the 90.9 percent of all 15- to 17-year-olds who received formal education on birth control or how to say no to sex. ""We are missing opportunities to deliver prevention messages before younger teens begin having sex"" -- both how to say 'no' to sex and the proper use of contraception, said Ileana Arias, the CDC's principal deputy director."	183	"[{""start"": 1860, ""end"": 1911, ""text"": ""• Kids are using the least effective contraceptives"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2324, ""end"": 2439, ""text"": ""he 90.9 percent of all 15- to 17-year-olds who received formal education on birth control or how to say no to sex."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1862, ""end"": 1911, ""text"": ""Kids are using the least effective contraceptives"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	188	2023-03-23T12:03:49.442858Z	2023-03-23T12:03:49.442957Z	2280.16
Since they premiered, MTV reality shows “16 and Pregnant” and “Teen Mom” have raised whoa-so-many eyebrows. A very vocal contingent of dismayed adults feared the shows glamorized teen pregnancy. That the young moms on the show often graced the covers of magazines such as Us Weekly only further proved that point: teenagers watching the show, the thinking went, would be jealous of the teen moms’ lives and celebrity. Bring on the pregnancy pacts! Unprotected sex for everyone, everywhere! As it turns out, though, “16 and Pregnant” didn’t inspire viewers to have kids; it inspired viewers to use contraception. “Media Influences on Social Outcomes: The Impact of MTV’s 16 and Pregnant on Teen Childbearing,” a study conducted by Professors Melissa Kearney of the University of Maryland and Phillip Levine of Wellesley College released early this year, finds that the MTV “Teen Mom” franchise did far more good than harm. Using data from Google Trends, Twitter, Nielsen ratings and Vital Statistics birth data, Professors Kearney and Levine found that teens who watch “16 and Pregnant” immediately go online to search for (and tweet about) birth control and abortion. Through some very impressive and fascinating dot-connecting, Kearney and Levine found that “16 and Pregnant” led to a 5.7% reduction in teen births — a percentage that accounts for one-third of the total decline in teen births: 20,000 fewer teen births a year. Some background from the study: In 2012, 29.4 out of every 1,000 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 gave birth in the U.S. It’s a good number and a bad one, depending on how you look at it: that’s a much higher rate than in any other developed nation (typical rates in the rest of the first world: 5-10 births per 1,000 girls) but it’s much lower than rates were in the U.S. 20 years ago, when there were a whopping 61.8 births per 1,000 teen girls. (Imagine the Facebook feeds, everyone.) As Kearney and Levine, who have been working on teen birth rates for more than 20 years, write in the study: “[T]he realities of the lives of teen mothers are presented in ways that may have been unknown or difficult to imagine for other teens viewing the show.” By shattering whatever cutesy, tiny-sock-wearing fantasy would-be mothers may have had before watching the show, “16 and Pregnant” revealed teen parenting as it actually is: grueling, expensive, exhausting, and, without an incredibly support system, often lonely. For a more detailed analysis of the study — how it was constructed, why most conventional wisdom about changing teen birth rates is wrong, and what these findings really mean, I reached out to Professor Phillip Levine. Below is a condensed and edited version of our conversation. How did you decide to look into the impact of “16 and Pregnant” in the first place? Teen childbearing has been mostly declining at a relatively slow pace for the past couple of decades. In 2008, it started falling a lot more quickly… [Professor Kearney] and I were very interested in thinking about what was happening. We read all the press accounts about the decline, and we knew the literature well enough to know that most of the conventional wisdom answers aren’t right. What are some of those conventional wisdom answers? Like, “We finally learned how to do sex education better,” or “abstinence-only programs are finally starting to work,” or “we have better ways to distribute contraception.” Sort of all the standard answers. Regardless of their effectiveness, they aren’t going to be able to explain a huge decline over the course of a year. And we read a press report through The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy [that] said [the decline] was partly about labor market predictions, where there are cyclical patterns, and partly about “16 and Pregnant.” That was novel and it was a plausible explanation. So we decided to investigate it. How familiar were you with “16 and Pregnant” and “Teen Mom” before you began your study? At that point, I knew absolutely nothing about the show. I kind of knew that it existed, I think I spent 10 minutes watching one in a hotel room that time. But I knew next to nothing about it. Of course the first thing [Professor Kearney and I] did, was, we Googled it. And it took about five minutes to realize that there was a controversy about the show, that a bunch of people thought it glamorized teen birth … And as the show progressed a little bit, and the teen birthrate dropped at the same time, people offered this conjecture that it was depressing teen birth as well. How do you go about connecting those two things: the birthrate and the TV show? Because it would be easy to point out that they aren’t necessary affected by one another. The easy criticism is that people learn somewhere along the line that correlation is not causation; just because teen births are falling when the show was starting doesn’t mean one caused the other. We are very familiar with that point of view. So what kind of data do you use? The simplest version is, we have Nielsen ratings about MTV shows, and we want to know, in the places where MTV shows are more popular, is it the case that at the moment when “16 and Pregnant” started, [the teen birth rate dropped]? You should expect to see a bigger reduction in teen birth in the places where more people are watching the show. And it’s got to be about the changes in birth rate, because if it’s always high or always low, we don’t care. We want to know, did the birth rate drop. And we find that the timing of the decline is very tightly intertwined with the airing of the first show, and we see that it has an effect on the age group [that watches the show]. It gets a pretty big following up to about age 24, so you see an effect on birth through age 24 but not beyond. How do you get from people watching the show to teen birth rates dropping in real life? Because even the best TV isn’t actually birth control. We know where babies come from. So can we find something to show that that behavior is changing as well? It would be great to get data directly about contraceptive use and sexual behavior, but that’s very difficult to do. So we decided to try out new data sources. In terms of social policy research, the use of Google Trends data and Twitter data is pretty novel…and it allows the researcher to actually get inside the heads of the viewer of the show to see what is changing about what they’re thinking about immediately afterwards. And it’s amazing. What did you look for? Apparently, when kids are watching TV these days, they have their phone in their hand. And when they see things that are meaningful to them, they tweet about them, or they search for another idea. So we see these huge spikes in searches and tweets immediately following the airing of a new [episode]. The first thing they’re searching on is the show itself and making some comment: “I just saw ’16 and Pregnant,’ blah blah.” But you can also link that to searches for birth control and abortion. What specific search terms did you use? In tweets, the search terms we used were “birth control” and “abortion.” In Google, where you can be a little more specific, we used “how do you get birth control,” “how do you get birth control pills,” “how do you get an abortion.” What did you find? What we were able to find was a very large number of tweets that literally said “’16 and Pregnant’ is the best form of birth control.” Thousands of tweets say that, or some variant of that. “Just watched ’16 and Pregnant,’ remembered to go take my birth control.” [We] also [saw] this apparently big movement of binge watching, mother-daughter “16 and Pregnant” marathons, which would never have occurred to me, except there’s people tweeting about it. So it opens up the possibility of this dialogue between mothers and daughters. In the grand scheme of factors that influence the decline in teen birth rates, how big a contributor are these TV shows? The economic conditions and the severity of the recession definitely contributed. During periods in which it’s difficult for a teen to get a job, and it’s difficult for the teen’s boyfriend and the teen’s parent to get a job, people are sitting there thinking, “It’s not obvious whether there’s going to be any support for this kid. It may not be a good time to get pregnant.” That happens across the age distribution, [not just to teenagers]. That was actually the biggest factor. We calculate that over half the decline is contributable to [the economy]. “16 and Pregnant” accounts for about a third. Now that you’re a “16 and Pregnant” and “Teen Mom” expert, what do you think about the shows? Just as a viewer, are you hooked? I think it’s incredibly compelling. I don’t know how anyone could possibly watch an episode of “16 and Pregnant” and think that it glamorizes teen pregnancy. It’s a very honest portrayal of the difficulties that these girls face. Anyone who thinks they’re going into this with a high probability that their boyfriend is going to stick around, or that they’ll continue their education, or maintain their friends, or continue going out and socializing, and maintain strong family relationships: there’s conflicts everywhere in these girls lives. I think what “16 and Pregnant” is so successful at doing is portraying images that seem very real. And that’s why it works. It has exactly the right combination of, it’s MTV and they know what kids like, and they can market the show in a way that draws in large numbers of viewers — because if nobody sees it, what difference does it make? — and including messages which are very honest and realistic.	178	"[{""start"": 490, ""end"": 611, ""text"": ""As it turns out, though, “16 and Pregnant” didn’t inspire viewers to have kids; it inspired viewers to use contraception."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 922, ""end"": 1167, ""text"": ""Using data from Google Trends, Twitter, Nielsen ratings and Vital Statistics birth data, Professors Kearney and Levine found that teens who watch “16 and Pregnant” immediately go online to search for (and tweet about) birth control and abortion."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1168, ""end"": 1428, ""text"": ""Through some very impressive and fascinating dot-connecting, Kearney and Levine found that “16 and Pregnant” led to a 5.7% reduction in teen births — a percentage that accounts for one-third of the total decline in teen births: 20,000 fewer teen births a year."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3254, ""end"": 3460, ""text"": ""Like, “We finally learned how to do sex education better,” or “abstinence-only programs are finally starting to work,” or “we have better ways to distribute contraception.” Sort of all the standard answers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3254, ""end"": 3460, ""text"": ""Like, “We finally learned how to do sex education better,” or “abstinence-only programs are finally starting to work,” or “we have better ways to distribute contraception.” Sort of all the standard answers."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 4403, ""end"": 4565, ""text"": ""And as the show progressed a little bit, and the teen birthrate dropped at the same time, people offered this conjecture that it was depressing teen birth as well"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 6824, ""end"": 7291, ""text"": ""The first thing they’re searching on is the show itself and making some comment: “I just saw ’16 and Pregnant,’ blah blah.” But you can also link that to searches for birth control and abortion.

A privately funded initiative in Colorado that drastically reduced teen pregnancy and abortion rates has recently been lauded by public health officials, policymakers and editorial boards alike. As a physician, I’ve been closely following the outcomes and results of this public health initiative. As Virginia’s lieutenant governor, I genuinely believe that Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree that reducing unintended pregnancies, decreasing abortion rates and improving the health of mothers and infants are important public health goals that should be carefully considered and debated. Over the past six years, Colorado observed a 40 percent decline in teen births and a 42 percent decline in teen abortions based on an innovative program that provided education, counseling, administrative support and long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARCs) to providers and patients upon request. These long-acting birth control methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs), injectables and implants, can last up to 10 years. They have a failure rate of less than 1 percent compared with condoms and the pill, which have failure rates of around 18 percent and 9 percent respectively. This is an issue Virginia needs to consider for the health of women of all ages, the health of our infants and the fiscal well-being of our commonwealth. Virginia’s teen pregnancy rates have fallen in recent years in line with national trends, but many states still do far better than us in this regard. In 2013, the birth rate for Virginia teens was 20.1 per 1,000 females aged 15 to 19. Provider and patient education about the safety and effectiveness of products is a key component in the success of such efforts. Unfortunately, myths also abound with regard to LARCs and the safety of IUDs, in particular. The American Academy of Pediatrics calls them a “first line” form of birth control for adolescents, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended the use of LARCs to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. Not only did making the most effective forms of birth control more accessible reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions in Colorado, but also it saved taxpayer dollars and demonstrated a clear return on investment. For every $1 invested in educating women and providing LARCs, the program saved the state more than $5 in Medicaid costs. While the Colorado initiative was focused on reducing teen pregnancy, we know that LARC use between pregnancies also helps improve the health of infants. Pregnancies spaced too closely together lead to increased rates of infant mortality. Although Virginia has reduced infant mortality rates in recent years, there is room for improvement. Helping women make informed decisions about the best contraceptive methods for their families would also help us ensure that more infants are celebrating their first birthdays. While the outcomes of this pilot program are dramatic, many women and families do not always have access to such options. The Affordable Care Act mandates that insurance plans cover every type of contraceptive, including LARCs, but various loopholes mean that some women have plans that do not cover LARCs. The average out-of-pocket cost for LARCs is roughly $800, making them prohibitively expensive for many. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of women in Virginia without health insurance or access to affordable care. If we are serious about reducing abortions and addressing the costs associated with unintended pregnancies, then affordable access to LARCs for these women must be a prominent part of the discussion. Because many Virginians have access to LARCs for the first time through their insurance under the Affordable Care Act, we need a concerted effort to work with physicians and clinics to educate women on all of their options. Despite LARCs’ safety and effectiveness, only 7 percent of women use them, but according to one study, when appropriately educated on all of their options and cost is not a factor, teens chose LARCs 72 percent of the time. As a physician and a policymaker, I believe all Virginia women should be informed about and have access to all possible reproductive health-care options so they can make the best decisions for their families. That includes the most effective forms of contraception, LARCs, which have clear potential to help us achieve shared goals of decreasing unintended pregnancies, reducing abortions and improving health outcomes for infants. Virginia should carefully evaluate the results of Colorado’s program and seriously consider our policies and investments in family planning methods and education efforts for providers and families alike.

When Wendy Swanson started out as a pediatrician eight years ago, it never crossed her mind to bring up the option of intrauterine devices — an insertable form of long-acting contraception — when she had her regular birth-control discussions with teenage patients who were sexually active. “The patch had been the thing,” she said, referring to a small, bandagelike square of plastic that transmits hormones through the skin to prevent unwanted pregnancies. But Swanson’s approach changed after a casual conversation with her sister-in-law. This relative wasn’t a doctor, but she worked at the Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Campaign of North Carolina, and she told Swanson that the devices could be used as a first choice of contraception for teenagers. Now Swanson regularly discusses IUDs, which are more than 99 percent effective, in her Seattle practice. “I thought, ‘I can’t believe I don’t know this and no one else in my office knew’ ” that IUDs could be a good choice for some patients, she said. Yet some pediatricians and other doctors worry they aren’t properly prepared to make this form of birth control available, because their training did not cover insertion of the devices. Experts say this has to change, starting during medical residencies, especially among pediatricians who will treat teenagers. Serious medical problems reported with the use of the Dalkon Shield in the 1970s frightened many women away from IUDs, and the extra cost associated with their insertion often stopped women from using them. But the devices have become increasingly popular. IUDs, which use copper or hormones to block sperm from fertilizing eggs, are considered safe in part because they do not use the problematic strings that were part of the Dalkon Shield, and a number of physician groups recommend them. And under the 2010 health law, women with insurance are eligible for IUDs without paying out-of-pocket costs. Almost 12 percent of women who used birth control between 2011 and 2013 chose IUDs, a rate surpassed only by contraceptive pills and condoms, according to a recent analysis by the Guttmacher Institute. Last fall, the American Academy of Pediatrics for the first time recommended IUDs as a first-line form of contraception for adolescents who have sex, though condoms and the pill are also accepted options. This recommendation builds on support from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which in 2011 termed it the most effective form of birth control and noted that it posed minimal risks. A year later, the group recommended it specifically for teens. Rare problems reported include disruption of menstrual cycles and, in rarer instances, perforation of the uterus. The IUD also can occasionally be expelled by a woman’s body, meaning it no longer prevents pregnancy. Once inserted, IUDs — which last for years before they need to be removed or replaced — don’t require daily attention. This makes them easier to manage than options such as condoms or daily birth control pills, which teenagers must remember to use or, in the pill’s case, take on a daily basis. Unlike condoms but like the pill, the IUD doesn’t prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Though the patch is about as effective as an IUD, it requires weekly maintenance and has attracted scrutiny in recent years for potential side effects such as strokes and blood clots. “So many kids never pick up the pills, or pick up the pills and don’t take them right,” said Melanie Gold, medical director of Columbia University’s School-Based Health Centers. “Clearly, an IUD is a better choice.” But even with this relatively recent buzz, a December editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics asserted that pediatricians often aren’t trained in the procedure — making it harder, experts said, for teenage girls to access this form of birth control, unlike adult women, who are more likely to see a gynecologist. Pediatric residents typically spend only a month studying “adolescent medicine,” which includes contraception. If residents are exposed to the procedure — something that depends heavily on the patients they happen to see during that month-long rotation — that time frame is “certainly not enough time to learn how to put in an IUD,” said Jane McGrath, chief of adolescent medicine at the University of New Mexico. Doctors offered different thoughts on how many times would be enough to become competent in inserting IUDs, but Gold suggested it might take 10 insertions before a physician would feel comfortable administering it. Pediatricians also may be less comfortable offering IUDs to patients than are other doctors, suggests a 2013 survey published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. Privacy can be an issue, said Swanson, who doesn’t do the insertion procedure in her office. A teenager may not want her parents to know she’s receiving the birth control, but “if she goes in and sees a gynecologist and the visit is billed,” it’s impossible for the pediatrician to guarantee that it won’t appear on an insurance statement. In those situations, Swanson said, she will send patients to Planned Parenthood or a similar provider, where the visit doesn’t get billed to a parent’s insurance plan.Teens also don’t always act on the referral, said Marissa Raymond-Flesch, an adolescent and young adult medicine fellow at the University of California at San Francisco. “They may have limited control over their time — particularly if they’re trying to come to receive services confidentially,” she said. Meanwhile, conversations with patients and their parents have changed “dramatically” since she began discussing IUDs, Swanson said. Initially, parents would be nervous about IUDs — suggesting, for instance, that they might cause infertility for their daughters. Now, by contrast, teens and parents seem “very open to” long-acting contraception, she said, and teenage girls are more likely to ask about IUDs without prompting. It’s still unclear whether and how residency curricula might change to incorporate IUDs and similar forms of contraception. If they become more popular, residents — especially those with an emphasis on adolescent medicine — might come to demand such training in medical school. But it’s hard to know when or how this might happen, said Mandy Coles, a co-author of the JAMA editorial and an adolescent medicine physician and assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine. “The bottom line is this is going to take more time and advocacy and research to improve training,” she said.
