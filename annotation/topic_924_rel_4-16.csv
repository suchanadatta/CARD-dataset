"Even after the Lion Air crash of its state-of-the-art Max 8 in October, Boeing was predicting another banner year in 2019. Orders of its 737 Max 8 aircraft were up. It had notched three major Pentagon contracts. And its stock was flying sky high. But now, after another of the aviation giant’s jets crashed, this time in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on board, it’s facing renewed questions about its safety and reliability as investors knocked back its share price more than 12 percent in early trading Monday. Boeing, which last year carried the Dow Jones industrial average to record highs, dragged it down on Monday morning, as the blue-chip measure opened in the red. China, Indonesia and Ethiopia have grounded the 737 Max 8, which was involved in both crashes, and other carriers have signaled they may follow suit. In a statement Monday, Boeing said no new safety guidance is planned as of now: "" The investigation is in its early stages, but at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance."" The Chicago-based U.S. aerospace giant, with more than $100 billion in revenue and 153,000 employees, is one of the most heavily weighted of the Dow’s 30 components. It has been one of the drivers of the 10-year-old bull market; its stock had been up more than 30 percent, year to date, as of Friday’s close. The ""decline is weighing heavily on the Dow because the stock has much more to surrender than other Dow components,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index showed slight gains in early trading Monday. Europe and Asia markets were also up, despite growing concerns over global growth spurred by a disappointing U.S. jobs report on Friday. The crash comes as the aerospace giant has been having a stellar year. Its commercial business has been surging. It pulled in those three major military contracts worth more than $18 billion to build training jets, replacement helicopters and drones that can refuel fighter jets in midair. Boeing is also building the next Air Force One, a spacecraft to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and a monster rocket that NASA says will again take them to the moon. In 2016, it celebrated its 100-year anniversary, a legacy that marches in lockstep with the history of American aviation, from dawn of commercial air travel in the years following the Wright brothers to the bombers that helped to allies win World War II, to the F-18 Hornets and 747s in use today. But now that investigators are probing two crashes that have killed a total of 346 people, the company is facing a crisis involving its core business and a threat to the reputation it has built up after decades. One of Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg’s goals for the company has been to better integrate its three major business units—commercial jets, defense and space—under a strategy he has called “One Boeing.” Its commercial airliner business, however, has long been the driver, and international orders for Boeing’s commercial jets continued to climb, even after the crash in October. With a backlog of 5,900 airplane orders, valued at $412 billion, it predicted steady growth in 2019. It is not clear what caused Sunday’s crash of Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302 six minutes after takeoff. on Sunday. Data show the plane ascending, then descending. It then began another ascent, this time while accelerating at faster-than-usual takeoff speeds. The pilot asked to return to Addis Ababa because he was experiencing difficulties, authorities said. In October, an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew members. Investigators blamed a faulty sensor and automatic feature for pointing its nose down while pilots struggled to lift the plane up. Though the investigation is still in the early stages, the similarities between the two crashes have prompted carriers around the world to take added precautions. China’s Civil Aviation Administration said it asked domestic carriers to temporarily ground all 737 Max 8 jets, potentially affecting hundreds of flights. Ethi­o­pian Airlines said its fleet would be grounded as a precaution, as did carriers in Indonesia and India. Boeing said it was working with investigators in Ethiopia to understand the cause of the crash. The 737 Max 8 has been an important profit driver for Boeing since it was introduced in 2017. It is crucial to Boeing’s broader international ambitions as it competes with Airbus, its European rival in the commercial airline business. Boeing has delivered 354 of the jets globally and has 2,912 on order, according to market estimates maintained by Boyd Group International. The jet that crashed Sunday was one of five 737 Max 8 planes operated by Ethiopian Airlines, which has 25 more on order. In the United States, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have 59 between their two fleets, with 304 on order. Southwest said it has been in touch with Boeing and plans to follow the investigation. It had not made any changes to its operations or inspection protocol as of Sunday, the airline said. American Airlines said it was monitoring the investigation but remained confident in the safety of its aircraft. While Boeing’s commercial business has long driven the company’s revenues and stock price, it has also focused on transforming its defense business under the leadership of Leanne Caret, who was brought in to lead the division in 2016. She was brought in after a Boeing and Lockheed Martin team had lost a high-stakes contract to Northrop Grumman to build a new stealth bomber for the Pentagon. But since then, the company has had some notable successes, such as the Pentagon contract wins, which came over rivals such as Lockheed Martin. The company was criticized as bidding too low in an effort to unseat competitors, but executives said in late October that those three combined opportunities would eventually rake in up to $60 billion over the next several decades. “Think of these as investments that enable a production run that begins in the early 2020s and will extend literally for decades,” Muilenburg, Boeing’s CEO, told investors at the time."	609	"[{""start"": 247, ""end"": 514, ""text"": ""But now, after another of the aviation giant’s jets crashed, this time in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on board, it’s facing renewed questions about its safety and reliability as investors knocked back its share price more than 12 percent in early trading Monday."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 676, ""end"": 824, ""text"": ""China, Indonesia and Ethiopia have grounded the 737 Max 8, which was involved in both crashes, and other carriers have signaled they may follow suit"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3504, ""end"": 3764, ""text"": ""The pilot asked to return to Addis Ababa because he was experiencing difficulties, authorities said.

"The father of an Indonesian doctor who died in the Oct. 29 Lion Air disaster is suing Chicago-based Boeing over a technical issue that allegedly played a role in his son’s death, in what appears to be the first formal legal action implicating the jet manufacturer in a crash that killed 189 people. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, by H. Irianto, the father of Dr. Rio Nanda Pratama. Pratama had been returning to Pangkal Pinang, in the east of Indonesia, from a conference in Jakarta to attend his own wedding when the brand-new Boeing 737 MAX8 he was aboard crashed into the Java Sea. The plaintiff is seeking “all damages available under the law,” citing Illinois wrongful death statutes. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined with certainty, with a full investigation expected to be finished later this month. But recent revelations that pilots weren’t trained on a new automated flight control feature in the 737 MAX8, which has been linked to the crash in initial statements by Indonesian authorities, have cast an unexpected spotlight on Boeing. “What is particularly noteworthy and disturbing about this case is that the evidence that has been made public so strongly points in the direction of a defect in the design of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and a failure by Boeing to adequately instruct and warn its airline customers and their pilots about the changes it made to the flight control system,” Curt Miner, an attorney representing the plaintiff, said in an email. “In recent years, when aviation accidents have occurred in foreign countries, they have typically been attributed to pilot error,"" he added. Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said “we extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families and loved ones of those on board"" in response to a request for comment on the lawsuit. If authorities conclude that a flight system failure caused the crash, it could deal a blow to Boeing’s commercial prospects at a time when it is trying to sell more passenger jets abroad. The 737 is the best-selling commercial jet in the company’s history, and the MAX8 was billed as an evolution of a tried-and-tested airplane. A week after the crash, Boeing warned international airlines that they could experience erroneous warnings from flight-control software on its planes related to so-called Angle of Attack (AOA) sensors, which measure which direction the plane’s nose and make automatic adjustments to prevent the plane from stalling. The company also notified pilots that a manual override built into previous plane models does not work on the Max 8. The Federal Aviation Administration issued its own separate warning drawing attention to the same issue on 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes. Pilots' representatives were caught off-guard by Boeing’s disclosure, saying they were not trained to handle or even made aware of that automated system, which can pitch the nose of a plane downward if it is fed faulty data. It was only on Nov. 7 — after disclosures from Indonesian authorities — that Boeing notified pilots of the systems' existence and added it to pilot manuals, representatives from two U.S. pilot unions said. In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Irianto blamed Boeing. His complaint argues that the company is guilty of negligence for designing a potentially faulty flight control system that is hard to override manually. The suit pointed to news reports stating that pilots had been insufficiently trained to handle the system. “At no relevant time prior to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 into the Java Sea did Boeing adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of the unsafe condition caused by the new “auto-diving” design of the 737 MAX 8 flight system,” the suit alleged. The outcome of Irianto’s suit will probably depend on whether the authorities determine that Boeing was at fault for the plane crash — as opposed to the regulators that signed off on system changes in the first place, or pilots who failed to steer the plane to safety. Pilots' associations have also criticized the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, regulatory entities that would have signed off on changes to flight control systems, for not spotting the issue sooner. “While the FAA and NTSB have been actively assisting in this investigation, the lack of critical safety information being provided to the air carriers and front-line operators is concerning,” Air Line Pilots Association president Tim Canoll wrote in a recent letter to regulators."	608	"[{""start"": 873, ""end"": 1111, ""text"": ""But recent revelations that pilots weren’t trained on a new automated flight control feature in the 737 MAX8, which has been linked to the crash in initial statements by Indonesian authorities, have cast an unexpected spotlight on Boeing."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1113, ""end"": 1536, ""text"": ""What is particularly noteworthy and disturbing about this case is that the evidence that has been made public so strongly points in the direction of a defect in the design of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and a failure by Boeing to adequately instruct and warn its airline customers and their pilots about the changes it made to the flight control system,” Curt Miner, an attorney representing the plaintiff, said in an email"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2199, ""end"": 2514, ""text"": ""A week after the crash, Boeing warned international airlines that they could experience erroneous warnings from flight-control software on its planes related to so-called Angle of Attack (AOA) sensors, which measure which direction the plane’s nose and make automatic adjustments to prevent the plane from stalling."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2515, ""end"": 2630, ""text"": ""The company also notified pilots that a manual override built into previous plane models does not work on the Max 8"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2632, ""end"": 2761, ""text"": ""he Federal Aviation Administration issued its own separate warning drawing attention to the same issue on 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2763, ""end"": 2987, ""text"": ""Pilots' representatives were caught off-guard by Boeing’s disclosure, saying they were not trained to handle or even made aware of that automated system, which can pitch the nose of a plane downward if it is fed faulty data."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3511, ""end"": 3754, ""text"": ""At no relevant time prior to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 into the Java Sea did Boeing adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of the unsafe condition caused by the new “auto-diving” design of the 737 MAX 8 flight system,” the suit alleged."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2632, ""end"": 2761, ""text"": ""The Federal Aviation Administration issued its own separate warning drawing attention to the same issue on 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 2515, ""end"": 2631, ""text"": ""The company also notified pilots that a manual override built into previous plane models does not work on the Max 8."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	587	2023-04-13T17:03:11.424970Z	2023-04-13T17:03:11.425078Z	133.478
U.S. aviation safety officials found themselves virtually alone Tuesday, after their counterparts in Europe and around the world ordered hundreds of Boeing aircraft grounded while investigators work to find the cause of an Ethio­pian Airlines crash that killed 157 this week. The Trump administration resisted bipartisan calls to temporarily suspend use of the Boeing 737 Max 8, even as President Trump consulted by phone with the besieged company’s CEO. With the European Union and others following China’s move to bar flights by some of the American aviation giant’s most important airplanes, former transportation safety officials said the Federal Aviation Administration risked losing its status as the world’s aviation safety leader. India became the latest country to ground the aircraft late Tuesday, declaring that none of the planes will be allowed to enter or transit airspace starting Wednesday afternoon. Hong Kong, New Zealand and United Arab Emirates have followed suit. The 737 Max 8, Boeing’s newest plane, has been involved in two crashes in less than six months. The first, in October, killed all 189 passengers and crew aboard a Lion Air flight when the plane plunged into the Java Sea off Indonesia shortly after takeoff. Former U.S. transportation secretary Ray LaHood, who was a GOP congressman before being appointed by President Barack Obama, said current Secretary Elaine Chao should immediately ground the aircraft. “Those planes should be pulled down and inspected. The flying public is owed that,” LaHood said Tuesday. But acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell said late Tuesday that his agency’s extensive review of “aggregate safety performance from operators and pilots of the Boeing 737 MAX . . . shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.” Other nations’ civil-aviation authorities had not “provided data to us that would warrant action,” Elwell said. In a conversation with Trump on Tuesday, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg argued to keep the planes in the sky, according to a senior administration official. The president has not made a final decision on what should be done in response to the Ethi­o­pia and Indonesia crashes, the official said, and is expected to have more meetings Wednesday. White House officials are working with FAA and Transportation Department officials to determine whether the pilots might have made mistakes or whether there were problems with the plane’s technology or manufacturing, the official said, adding that the administration does not want to make a knee-jerk decision and is concerned that grounding the fleet could have widespread financial effects and cause unnecessary fear. But a former FAA official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly, said those effects are already being felt, regardless of what the United States does. “Effectively, it’s grounded anyway,” the former official said. “If all these countries won’t let these planes in, who [cares] what the U.S. allows?” The United States and Canada have defied the global aviation community in keeping the 737 Max planes in service. Until late Tuesday, FlyDubai was the only other large carrier outside North America using the aircraft. At least 222 planes have been grounded worldwide, according to a Washington Post analysis. An additional 158 of the aircraft remained eligible for service — largely in the United States and Canada — with slightly more than 100 of them in the fleets of five airlines: American, Air Canada, Southwest, United and WestJet. The White House has spoken with officials at American and Southwest about the planes, the senior administration official said. Some observers see parallels between the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines flight and the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash. Both planes were new Boeing Max 8s that went down shortly after takeoff. Both also struggled to gain altitude and appeared to ascend and descend several times before crashing. But experts say it is too early to determine whether the same problem that stymied the pilots’ ability to control the Lion Air flight — a malfunctioning sensor coupled with an automated response from the aircraft’s software — contributed to the downing of the Ethiopian Airlines plane. Investigators have not determined a final cause of the Lion Air crash. LaHood said he took the precautionary step to ground planes in 2013, after lithium-ion batteries on Boeing 787 Dreamliners overheated, causing acrid smoke and alarms. “I consulted with the FAA administrator, and I talked to the CEO of Boeing, and obviously Boeing didn’t like the decision when it was made. But when all the planes were inspected and determined to be safe, everybody was fine,” LaHood said. LaHood said that he told the White House what he was doing but that Obama was not involved. Chao — whose supporters cited her aviation industry experience as a former member of the board of Northwest Airlines when Trump named her secretary — reiterated Tuesday that her department would take “immediate and appropriate action” if a safety issue were identified. “The Department and the FAA are working closely with the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Ethiopian accident investigation bureau, to determine the cause of this tragedy as quickly as possible, and to assess any necessary actions going forward,” Chao said. A Chao spokesman did not respond directly to questions about LaHood or the rush by the international aviation safety community to ground the planes. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said he wants to know more about the FAA’s decisions regarding pilot retraining on the new Boeing model and suggested that the agency could be conflicted because of its dual role in regulating U.S. aviation and promoting the industry. Muilenburg’s call to Trump followed tweets by the president complaining that airplanes in general are becoming overly automated. But there had been discussions the night before about setting up the call, a person familiar with it said, and it was not in reaction to the tweets. “Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT.” “Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger,” the president added. “All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!” Muilenburg stressed to the president that the planes are safe, the person said. Since Trump has been in office, the pair have developed a relationship. Muilenburg also called when Trump, as president-elect, took aim at the cost of the new Air Force One that Boeing is building. Boeing donated $1 million to Trump’s record-size inaugural fund. The pair later met at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and at Trump Tower to discuss the program. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” Trump tweeted in December 2016. “Cancel order!” In that call, Muilenburg reiterated that “it’s Boeing’s honor to be part of the program,” an official confirmed at the time. Last year, Trump reached a $3.9 billion deal with Boeing to build Air Force One. Muilenburg was with Trump when the president called a top Pentagon official to compare the F-35, built by Boeing’s competitor Lockheed Martin, to Boeing’s ­­F/A-18 Super Hornet. In June, during a meeting of the National Space Council, Trump praised the CEO. “Dennis Muilenburg, friend of mine. A great guy,” Trump said. “The head of Boeing. And, boy, have you done a good job on all fronts — commercial, military.” And after several CEOs resigned from Trump’s manufacturing council in 2017 over the president’s handling of a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Muilenburg kept a low profile and did not speak out against Trump. The president disbanded the council amid growing backlash. Intense scrutiny of the 737 Max comes as Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, vies to cement his leadership of the Pentagon. Shanahan, who headed Boeing’s commercial aircraft division during a long career at the aviation company, spent 18 months serving as the Pentagon’s No. 2 before being tapped as acting defense secretary in December when predecessor Jim Mattis unexpectedly resigned. A senior defense official familiar with Shanahan’s employment at Boeing said that “Shanahan had no responsibility over the 737 Max” while at the company. Another executive had been in charge of the aircraft, which was considered part of a “development program,” the official said. “Safety is Boeing’s number one priority and we have full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX,” Boeing said in a statement. “We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets. We’ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets. The United States Federal Aviation Administration is not mandating any further action at this time, and based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.” Chris Nutter, a former Navy pilot and retired airline captain with 21 years at Alaska Airlines, said the variety of responses from safety officials “are all probably prudent under the circumstances. I wouldn’t take alarm with any of these groundings, nor would I take alarm with the continuing operation of the aircraft.” He said there’s confidence in the FAA and the NTSB’s record of identifying and addressing immediate safety concerns, in the U.S. pilot training program, and in Boeing’s procedures to address problems. The planes are being flown every day in American airways, he said, and pilots would not stay silent if they had concerns. “When I get in an airplane to fly it, I have a vested interest in the safety of the airplane. We are not going to get on an airplane that we are not fully ready to put our family in and go fly it somewhere,” said Nutter, who teaches aviation at the University of Southern California’s Aviation Safety & Security Program. “Those crews are not going to get on those aircraft if they aren’t safe. All of the politics and money aside, everyone wants to operate and will only operate a safe aircraft.” But the former FAA official said the agency’s handling of the crisis had become a “debacle” that reflects its responsibility if any gaps in oversight are discovered during the investigation. At issue are sensors, software and other automation technologies that are part of the aircraft, the certification of those features, and the training needed to make sure the aircraft are flown safely. “You have this huge organization, the FAA, just like you have a huge organization, Boeing, and they have been joined at the hip through all these different variations of the aircraft, including decisions around the design and use of this new system, and everything that follows from this new system, including the manuals and the training,” the former official added. “It’s not just Boeing’s decisions that are being reviewed, it’s the FAA’s.” michael.laris@washpost.com lori.aratani@washpost.com josh.dawsey@washpost.com toluse.olorunnipa@washpost.com	607	"[{""start"": 737, ""end"": 916, ""text"": "".

, said Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Committee. Ony Suryo Wibowo, another investigator, said that it was too early to say what caused the crash. The full investigation could take a year. The two Indonesian airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, national carrier Garuda and Lion Air, both declined to comment on the bulletin. Indonesian officials say that all 11 such aircraft have been tested and declared safe to fly.  The 787 Max 8 is the second Boeing aircraft to experience serious technical problems soon after its introduction, leading some analysts to question whether Boeing may have overlooked quality concerns as it strives to meet rising global demand. Boeing has been working to increase production capacity at the Renton, Wash., factory where 737s are assembled. The FAA grounded Boeing’s entire 787 fleet in 2013 after lithium-ion batteries overheated and caught fire. The National Transportation Safety Board later faulted Boeing as well as its battery supplier, GS Yuasa, for its approach to safety and quality control. The Seattle Times reported in August that Boeing’s Renton factory has struggled to meet its production targets amid late deliveries from companies manufacturing its components. The company has sought to increase its production from 47 jets per month to 52 per month. On Wednesday, Indonesian officials said the doomed flight would be re-created at Boeing facilities in Seattle to see what role the sensor may have played. Experts have been puzzled about what could have caused the jet to go down in clear skies, unlike other major airplane disasters in which weather or older jets were major factors. The impact of the crash caused the wreckage to scatter, making it difficult to find and identify the victims. As of Thursday afternoon local time, 51 of the 189 people on board had been identified. The data from the flight recorder and Boeing’s statement have provided the first clues, but rescuers are still searching for the device that records voices in the plane’s cockpit. That recorder is expected to provide a clearer picture to investigators of the Lion Air flight’s final moments.  “Boeing has now introduced two aircraft that have had significant problems,” said Henry Harteveldt, an analyst with the consultancy Atmosphere Research Group. “What will have to be found is, is Boeing pushing itself too hard? Are the workers moving too fast to meet production deadlines?” Still, Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the commercial passengers should not be nervous about getting on a 737 Max 8. “We’re going to learn from this just like we learned from the A330,” he said, referring to a 2009 incident in which an Airbus A330 crashed off the coast of Brazil with 228 people on board due to electronics failures. “The big picture is the system keeps getting safer and safer, and it’s still the safest form of transportation ever designed by humans,” he said. foreign@washpost.com	604	"[{""start"": 2179, ""end"": 2335, ""text"": ""Boeing has now introduced two aircraft that have had significant problems,” said Henry Harteveldt, an analyst with the consultancy Atmosphere Research Group"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 229, ""end"": 825, ""text"": ""The two Indonesian airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, national carrier Garuda and Lion Air, both declined to comment on the bulletin.

Boeing’s path to returning its 737 Max jet to service is being held up by questions from the Federal Aviation Administration. The U.S. regulator has asked Boeing to provide more details about “how pilots interact with the airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios,” the company said in a statement Thursday. A spokesman for the FAA confirmed the agency is asking about pilot interaction on the 737 Max but declined to provide more information about the review process or how long it is expected to take. “This process will take as long as necessary to ensure the aircraft is returned to service safely,” FAA spokesman Gregory Martin said. More than two months after a deadly plane crash led to the worldwide grounding of the 737 Max, Boeing is facing mounting pressure from investors, airline customers and suppliers to get its flagship jet back into the air. Airlines are incurring millions of dollars in costs as planes sit idle and Boeing continues to produce 42 planes a month, which it cannot sell until the jet has been cleared by regulators. Boeing’s timeline for a fix has been a moving target. The company has yet to submit its final package of software fixes to the FAA for approval, something it said it would do by early April. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in late April that the company had completed its final technical test flight with the updated flight control system and was preparing for a certification flight and formal review by the FAA. In its statement Thursday, Boeing repeated its claim that its update for the 737 Max software has been completed. Once it has addressed the FAA’s questions, “Boeing will work with the FAA to schedule its certification test flight and submit final certification documentation,” the company said. Boeing said the flight controls have been tested on 360 hours of flights, up from 246 hours in late April. The FAA’s acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell told members of Congress this week that the decisions of pilots played a role in the crashes of 737 Max jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia. An automated anti-stall feature activated when it wasn’t supposed to in the October crash in Indonesia, Elwell said. That sent the plane’s nose down repeatedly. The pilots should have responded by turning off the motors to the part of the airplane that was forcing it downward, but they did not, Elwell said. When the same automated feature — known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, mistakenly kicked in less than five months later on the 737 Max involved in the Ethiopia crash — the pilots “didn’t adhere to the emergency” directive issued by the FAA in November, Elwell said.	606	"[{""start"": 658, ""end"": 752, ""text"": ""More than two months after a deadly plane crash led to the worldwide grounding of the 737 Max,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2225, ""end"": 2372, ""text"": ""The pilots should have responded by turning off the motors to the part of the airplane that was forcing it downward, but they did not, Elwell said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2373, ""end"": 2662, ""text"": ""When the same automated feature — known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, mistakenly kicked in less than five months later on the 737 Max involved in the Ethiopia crash — the pilots “didn’t adhere to the emergency” directive issued by the FAA in November, Elwell said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	584	2023-04-13T16:34:16.135328Z	2023-04-13T16:34:16.135389Z	179.214
The Justice Department’s criminal division is looking into the Boeing 737 Max, a person familiar with the matter said, although the exact parameters of that inquiry could not immediately be learned. Additionally, an investigator with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Inspector General has sought information about the Federal Aviation Administration’s certification of the plane and its training materials, according to a source with knowledge of that effort. It was unclear to what extent the efforts may overlap. But the pursuit of information by federal investigators comes as the FAA and Boeing face growing questions about the way the government and company worked together to certify the airplane involved in crashes in Ethi­o­pia and Indonesia within months of each other. The FAA has for years relied heavily on Boeing and the other companies it regulates to do much of the work of certifying safety, prompting critics to warn that the agency’s approach to the industry is too lenient and could be dangerous. The FAA has argued that its processes are “well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs.” The FAA and Boeing declined to comment on the work of federal investigators. As with all legal matters, “we do not comment even as to whether such matters exist,” a Boeing spokesman said. The company had said earlier that the FAA’s certification requirements for the 737 Max aircraft were “identical” to those that “governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives.” The FAA did not say if it was looking at an internal investigation of its own, but a spokesman said that “our full focus is on the software upgrade and supporting the accident investigation.” The software change is meant to address an automated feature of the Max jets that investigators say contributed to the Oct. 29 crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people. Flawed sensor data feeding into the plane’s anti-stall system helped push the aircraft downward and into the Java Sea, according to a preliminary report. A spokesman for the Transportation Department’s Office of Inspector General would not confirm or deny an investigation. The office does, however, have an auditing arm. The spokesman said that while no new audit has been announced into the Max certification, the office is always “evaluating our use of audit resources and considering future audit work in light of emerging issues,” including congressional requests and earlier audits it has performed on the FAA’s airplane certification procedures. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, first reported that a grand jury in Washington had issued a subpoena to at least one person involved in the development of the 737 Max. The Journal also said a second inquiry by the Transportation Department’s inspector general is focused on the Seattle-area office of the FAA charged with certifying aircraft as well as an office that mandates training requirements. Meanwhile, data from the flight recorders on the Ethio­pian Airlines jet show “clear similarities” with the October Lion Air flight in Indonesia, investigators in France said Monday, echoing comments from Ethiopian authorities over the weekend. “You got two airplanes of the same type that have experienced problems. So of course they are going to go back and look at the certification process. FAA is going to look at that themselves. And it also appears DOT is going to look at it,” said John M. Cox, a former pilot and an airline safety consultant with the Washington-based aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems. “They are going to look at everything.” Even as investigators studying the data have found several similarities, Larry Rooney, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations (CAPA), a trade association for more than 30,000 pilots, said that does necessarily mean a quick resolution. “I suspect even though there will be some similarities, [the crashes] won’t be mirror images of each other,” Rooney said. “No two accidents are exactly the same.” And then there is the question of when the planes will fly again. In 2013, when the FAA grounded Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner amid concerns about the plane’s lithium ion batteries, it took three months before the aircraft returned to the skies. “Grounding [the 737 Max jets] was easy; ungrounding it is going to be hard. The question is going to be how much is going to be enough to put the airplane back in the air,” Rooney said. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said last week that he plans to hold one or more hearings on the Boeing crashes. On Sunday, Ethiopia Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said the condition of the data and voice recorders was good and that enough data had been recovered that her ministry’s Accident Investigation Bureau would release a preliminary report in 30 days on what happened to Flight 302. Officials with France’s Bureau D’Enquetes et D’Analyses (BEA) confirmed the “clear similarities” Monday, in announcing that the data from the flight recorders had been transferred to the Ethiopian Accident Investigation Bureau. The BEA, which has extensive experience analyzing crashes in Europe, began work March 15 to retrieve information from the flight data recorder. Its role in the investigation is now complete, as it has handed off the retrieved data to Ethi­o­pia for further analysis. Last week investigators found a device known as a jackscrew in the wreckage, which suggests the Ethio­pian flight might have had a problem with the automated system also suspected in the Lion Air crash. The jackscrew, used to set the device that raises and lowers the plane’s nose, indicates the jet was configured to dive, Cox said. That was the second piece of information suggesting similarities between the two crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets. FAA officials last week also cited satellite tracking data as a key similarity. The planes in both cases ascended and descended multiple times before crashing, experts said. Initial flight data as well as subsequent satellite information showed the Ethio­pian Airlines plane in trouble almost immediately and that it had an erratic flight path during the six minutes the plane was in the air before it crashed into a field outside Addis Ababa, killing all 157 aboard. Officials from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which sent three investigators to France, the FAA, and Boeing also are assisting in the probe. U.S. investigators will continue to assist in the analysis of the data, an NTSB spokesman said Monday. Any progress report on the investigation will be issued by Ethio­pian authorities, per international protocol. Boeing on Sunday said the company was working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available. “Safety is our highest priority as we design, build and support our airplanes. As part of our standard practice following any accident, we examine our aircraft design and operation, and when appropriate, institute product updates to further improve safety,” the company said in a statement. “While investigators continue to work to establish definitive conclusions, Boeing is finalizing its development of a previously-announced software update and pilot training revision that will address” the way the automated anti-stall feature, known as MCAS, responds to “erroneous sensor inputs. We also continue to provide technical assistance at the request of and under the direction of the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Accredited Representative working with Ethiopian investigators,” the company said. In all, more than 300 people have died in the two crashes involving the Max 8 jet. In November, Boeing issued a bulletin on how to reset the stabilizer if it started to push the plane’s nose down. Boeing said last week it had stopped delivery of all 737 Max jets. The company said it would continue manufacturing them, however. matt.zapotosky@washpost.com michael.laris@washpost.com luz.lazo@washpost.com lori.aratani@washpost.com	605	"[{""start"": 532, ""end"": 796, ""text"": ""But the pursuit of information by federal investigators comes as the FAA and Boeing face growing questions about the way the government and company worked together to certify the airplane involved in crashes in Ethi­o­pia and Indonesia within months of each other."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 797, ""end"": 1032, ""text"": ""The FAA has for years relied heavily on Boeing and the other companies it regulates to do much of the work of certifying safety, prompting critics to warn that the agency’s approach to the industry is too lenient and could be dangerous"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1898, ""end"": 2050, ""text"": ""Flawed sensor data feeding into the plane’s anti-stall system helped push the aircraft downward and into the Java Sea, according to a preliminary report"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5627, ""end"": 5879, ""text"": ""The jackscrew, used to set the device that raises and lowers the plane’s nose, indicates the jet was configured to dive, Cox said.

JAKARTA, Indonesia — Airplane manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday issued a bulletin to airlines worldwide warning of erroneous readings from flight-control software on its planes, after a Lion Air jetliner crashed into the sea soon after takeoff, killing the 189 people on board.  Boeing, which is assisting in an investigation into what went wrong in the Oct. 29 crash of one of its new 737 Max 8 jets, said it issued the bulletin as “part of its usual process.” The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday issued an emergency notice to all operators of Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes. It warned airlines that erroneous sensor inputs like the one that came into play in Indonesia “could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,” leading to “possible impact with terrain.” Boeing’s bulletin was the first indication that an error with the aircraft’s systems may have caused problems for the Lion Air flight, which took off from Jakarta. At takeoff, the plane’s altitude fluctuated dramatically, and the plane increased in speed before nose-diving into the Java Sea 13 minutes later. Indonesian investigators have recovered the plane’s flight data recorder, which showed that the plane’s airspeed indicator malfunctioned on its last four flights. “It’s a stunning simple but deadly error,” said Mary Schiavo, an aviation lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department. “I can’t even recall the number of accidents I’ve worked where the accident happened the first flight after maintenance. A reported problem, they supposedly fixed it, and then it goes down.” Boeing’s bulletin said, “The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee has indicated that Lion Air Flight 610 experienced erroneous input from one of its AOA (Angle of Attack) sensors.” A misreading in the sensor can cause a plane to dive suddenly.  The bulletin provided instructions to flight crews on what they can to do correct the sensor’s “failure,” which it said can happen when the flight is being operated in manual. Indonesian investigators said Wednesday that an AOA sensor on the jet was replaced the day before the doomed flight, on Oct. 28, when a pilot flying the same aircraft on a different route, from Bali to Jakarta, reported problems with it. The pilot on the crashed Lion Air flight had asked shortly after takeoff to return to the airport in Jakarta but lost contact with air traffic controllers afterward. The Angle of Attack sensor, shown to reporters at a press conference in Jakarta on Wednesday, was manufactured by Minnesota-based Rosemount Aerospace Inc. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Schiavo said it’s clear from flight-tracking data that the pilots fought to keep the plane up. “The pilots had a battle on their hands for a few minutes,” she said. “They couldn’t get above 5,000 feet at a time when they should have been over [10,000]. Something happened three to four minutes into the flight. They called to turn back to the airport, but they didn’t call mayday, which means they didn’t have time. They were fighting something.” In Jakarta, investigators showed reporters the AOA sensor that was removed from the aircraft. The small black cylinder contains a sensor that controls the angle between the wing and the air it is moving through. If the angle is too high as a plane climbs, that would cause a stall. The Boeing 737 Max 8 jets are among the manufacturer’s newest models and have been snapped up by airliners in booming aviation markets, including Indonesia and India. More than 200 are in service across the world, billed as the most advanced of the popular 737 jets — and capable of flying more than twice as far than the plane that debuted in 1967. Indonesian authorities would provide Boeing with information from the pilot who flew with the problematic sensor so it could be shared with other airlines	603	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 276, ""text"": ""A, Indonesia — Airplane manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday issued a bulletin to airlines worldwide warning of erroneous readings from flight-control software on its planes, after a Lion Air jetliner crashed into the sea soon after takeoff, killing the 189 people on board."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1110, ""end"": 1421, ""text"": ""ndonesian investigators have recovered the plane’s flight data recorder, which showed that the plane’s airspeed indicator malfunctioned on its last four flights. “It’s a stunning simple but deadly error,” said Mary Schiavo, an aviation lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 964, ""end"": 1108, ""text"": ""t takeoff, the plane’s altitude fluctuated dramatically, and the plane increased in speed before nose-diving into the Java Sea 13 minutes later"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1809, ""end"": 2048, ""text"": ""A misreading in the sensor can cause a plane to dive suddenly.  The bulletin provided instructions to flight crews on what they can to do correct the sensor’s “failure,” which it said can happen when the flight is being operated in manual."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 461, ""end"": 799, ""text"": ""he Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday issued an emergency notice to all operators of Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes.

"A plane crash that killed 157 people in Ethiopia on Sunday morning is likely to aggravate concerns about the safety of one of Boeing’s newest commercial jets, aviation analysts say. The incident comes as the company faces intense scrutiny over another deadly plane crash involving the same 737 MAX 8 model. In October, Lion Air Flight 610 in a new state-of-the-art MAX 8 plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew members. Boeing faces lawsuits filed by the families of at least two dozen victims. In a memo to staff members days after that crash, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg wrote, “We’re going to learn from this accident and continue to improve our safety record.” With the Addis Ababa investigation in its earliest phases, it is too early to know whether that crash was caused by the same problems that doomed the Lion Air flight in Indonesia. Ethio­pian Airlines said its investigators, the Ethio­pian Civil Aviation Authority and the Ethio­pian Transport Authority will conduct an inquiry “in collaboration with all stakeholders including the aircraft manufacturer Boeing” to determine the cause. The 737 MAX 8 has been an important profit driver for Boeing since it was introduced in 2017. It is critical to Boeing’s broader international ambitions as it competes with Airbus, its European rival in the commercial airline business. Boeing has delivered 354 of the jets globally and has 2,912 on order, according to market estimates maintained by Boyd Group International. The jet that crashed Sunday was one of five 737 MAX 8 planes operated by Ethiopian Airlines, which has 25 more on order. In the United States, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have 59 between their two fleets, with 304 on order. Southwest said it has been in touch with Boeing and plans to follow the investigation. It had not made any changes to its operations or inspection protocol as of Sunday, the airline said. American Airlines said it was monitoring the investigation but remained confident in the safety of its aircraft. In a statement addressing the Ethiopia crash, Boeing said it has a technical team ready to provide assistance at the direction of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. “Boeing is deeply saddened to learn of the passengers and crew on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a 737 MAX 8 airplane,” Boeing said. “We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethiopian Airlines team.” Although it was too soon to determine the exact cause of the Ethio­pian Air crash, the plane, which was new, showed a similar flight path to the one in the Indonesia crash. An Ethiopian Airlines executive said Sunday that the airplane had “no technical remarks” and was flown by an experienced pilot, Yared Getachew, 28, of Addis Ababa. He said the pilot mentioned he was having difficulty and wanted to return before he lost contact with air traffic control. Aviation analysts say they are awaiting the final results of the Indonesian airline’s investigation and suggested that the results could negatively affect business for Boeing. “If this has any relationship at all with the Lion Air incident, it’s a pretty good bet that the [Federal Aviation Administration] will move to have all 737 MAX aircraft inspected immediately,” said Mike Boyd, an aviation analyst with Boyd Group International. Experts urged caution about drawing conclusions too quickly. Although details of the crashes — shortly after takeoff, at relatively low altitudes with erratic flight patterns — seem similar, the data is insufficient to conclude the same systems were at fault. “Because of the apparent similarities between this and the Lion Air crash the questions naturally arise: Is this a similar crash?” said aviation consultant Scott Hamilton, managing director of Leeham Company, which provides aviation expertise and marketing analysis. “It may well turn out that there is a connection, but we don’t know that today.” If the results of an inspection turn up significant design flaws in the 737 MAX, planes could be grounded worldwide, Boyd said. China’s Civil Aviation Administration said in a statement Sunday that it has asked domestic airlines to temporarily ground all Boeing 737 Max jets. The move affected hundreds of flights on Monday in China, where 13 carriers operate more than 90 of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jets, domestic media reported. Chinese carriers have placed 180 orders for the model, Boeing said. Cayman Airways also has suspended Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, Fabian Whorms, the company’s president and chief executive, said in a statement Sunday night. The FAA said that it was planning to assist in the investigation of the crash, which killed everyone onboard, including eight Americans and 18 Canadians. “The FAA is closely monitoring developments in the Ethiopian Flight 302 crash early this morning,” the agency said. “We are in contact with the State Department and plan to join the NTSB in its assistance with Ethiopian civil aviation authorities to investigate the crash.” Boeing’s investors and customers seem to have shrugged off the issues related to the crash in Indonesia. Boeing had a banner year in 2018, notching $100 billion in revenue, amid accelerating international sales of its commercial jetliners. The 737 is the best-selling plane model in the company’s history. The commercial jetliner has gone through multiple iterations and upgrades since it first flew in 1967. The crash in Indonesia turned a harsh spotlight on the MAX 8, Boeing’s latest update to its workhorse 737. A preliminary investigative report released in late November found that a malfunctioning sensor and an automated response from the aircraft’s software left pilots fighting furiously to control the aircraft before it careened into the Java Sea off Indonesia shortly after takeoff, killing 189 people. The report found that a sensor measuring the plane’s “angle of attack” fed erroneous data into the plane’s flight-control system, at which point an automatic feature kicked in, sending the plane into a nosedive. The report stopped short of assigning blame for the crash. However, multiple pilots organizations in the United States criticized Boeing after it disclosed that it had made certain changes to the MAX’s autopilot software — it added a new flight-control feature, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The updated software was meant to account for design changes to the 737 MAX and was supposed to make the plane operate as closely as possible to older 737 models despite having larger engines placed farther forward on the plane’s wings. While the MCAS system was ostensibly added to make the plane safer, pilot unions in the United States said they had been left “in the dark” about the software update and criticized Boeing for failing to cover the new system in training sessions. A Boeing spokesman did not respond to questions about whether the company had updated the MCAS system following the plane crash in Indonesia. Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, a union that represents pilots at American Airlines, said Boeing executives initially told his members that the company had been looking at potential software-design issues, but they had not received word about whether the system had changed. He said pilots at American Airlines still do not have flight simulators reflecting updates to the MAX 8. “We have not been briefed on any changes to the software at this point,” Tajer said. The lawsuits against Boeing in the Lion Air crash have zeroed in on claims raised by pilot organizations, which accused the company of including the new autopilot update in the 737 MAX8 without informing pilots. Among the first lawsuits was filed by an Indonesian man named H. Irianto, the father of an Indonesian doctor named Rio Nanda Pratama. “At no relevant time prior to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 into the Java Sea did Boeing adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of the unsafe condition caused by the new “auto-diving” design of the 737 MAX 8 flight system,” Irianto alleged. Boeing has not seen orders of new 737 models canceled as a result of the crash. Airlines considering future orders will be watching the situation in Ethiopia closely. Two 737 MAX 8 commercial jets “have crashed shortly after takeoff. The airlines are going to be very interested to know whether this was a problem with the airplane, the training or both,” said Henry Harteveldt, an aviation-market analyst with Atmosphere Research. “For airlines that are debating whether to order the [Boeing 737] MAX and how that would compare to other planes on the market,"" he said, ""it’s very possible that tomorrow Airbus reps will get a few calls from people that had been considering Boeing.” Hamilton said the cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders would provide critical information on what transpired in the six minutes between the flight’s takeoff and the Ethiopia crash. “It’s highly unusual for a new model airplane to have one accident -- let alone two in such a short period of time,” he said. “And, of course, investigators are going to look at the flight-tracker radar pattern, the circumstances. And one of the first things they’re going to zero in on: They’re going to look at MCAS performance, that’s going to be a natural thing for them to do.” Gerry Shih in Hong Kong contributed to this report."	602	"[{""start"": 2, ""end"": 180, ""text"": ""e crash that killed 157 people in Ethiopia on Sunday morning is likely to aggravate concerns about the safety of one of Boeing’s newest commercial jets, aviation analysts sa"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 182, ""end"": 487, ""text"": ""he incident comes as the company faces intense scrutiny over another deadly plane crash involving the same 737 MAX 8 model.

The different responses to Sunday’s crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8, the second in less than six months, reflect how different the stakes are for the countries and airlines involved, experts and analysts said Monday. While U.S. regulators and airlines remain attentive to the investigation into the Ethio­pian Airlines crash involving the world’s fastest-selling passenger plane, officials here and in Europe said they are confident that pilot training, maintenance practices and safeguards in place will prevent a catastrophe such as the one that killed 157 people in Ethi­o­pia on Sunday. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a “continued airworthiness notification” to the international community Monday, meant to convey its confidence in the American-made jetliner. The notification essentially means that U.S. regulators believe the planes are safe, but they will take action if they receive information that indicates otherwise. “The FAA continuously assesses and oversees the safety performance of U.S. commercial aircraft,” Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a conference call with reporters regarding President Trump’s budget. “If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.” Questions about the plane were raised in October, when Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea in Indonesia killing all 189 passengers and crew aboard. Both flights went down shortly after takeoff and appeared to have similar flight paths. Airlines and regulators in Ethi­o­pia, China and several other countries announced they were temporarily grounding the Max 8 jets. But in the United States and Europe, regulators, industry groups and Boeing all said it was too soon to draw any conclusions. For the countries and airlines that have grounded the plane, the decision reflects fears about their unfamiliarity with the new technology and the potential fallout from a catastrophe — particularly for new and smaller carriers, analysts said. For U.S. regulators, the bar for taking such a dramatic step is much higher, they said. “I don’t think that we have concrete data to justify it at this point,” said John Cox, a former pilot and an airline-safety consultant with the Washington-based aviation-safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems. “Grounding an airplane is a big step and so we want to take it very cautiously — only if there is justification for it.” In the United States, there would have to be a clear mechanical issue or specific safety concern tying the two crashes, such as the several fire incidents that led the FAA to ground Boeing 787 Dreamliners because of faulty lithium-ion batteries in 2013, experts said. Monday’s signal from top U.S. officials that the 737 Max 8 remained airworthy indicated that standard had not been met, although there was strong speculation that the crash was connected to the same “angle of attack” sensor that factored into the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash. China abruptly pulled 100 of the planes from operation through its civil aviation authority after Sunday’s crash. Some analysts attributed the decision to political motivations, given the countries’ strained geopolitical relationship and Boeing’s status as the world’s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer. But the Civil Aviation Administration of China said the step was taken in “view of the fact that the two air crashes are newly delivered” 737 Max 8 planes, that both happened during takeoff and “they have certain similarities.” The government regulator said the decision reflected “zero tolerance” for safety risks. “I think in this case, they’re really worried that there’s something wrong with the airplane,” said Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consultant Leeham. So why the different approach from operators in the United States? “Training is better with U.S. pilots than some of the carriers that have already put the airplanes in service,” Hamilton said. He cited the reaction from American Airlines and Southwest Airlines pilots after the Lion Air crash, who, he said, raised “holy hell” to address the omissions in the flight manuals about the “angle of attack” safety sensor that was said to be at least partially at fault in that crash. “If I were the pilots at American and Southwest and even United and became aware of this because of Lion Air, that would be part of my training right away,” Hamilton said. Ethio­pian Airlines is well-regarded in the aviation industry for its safety record. Its last major crash was in 2010, when all 90 people aboard an aircraft were killed when it caught fire and plunged into the Mediterranean after it took off from Beirut’s airport. Before that, its last major air safety incident was a 1996 hijacking that killed more than 100, one of the deadliest air hijackings up to that point. But it was not a disaster that called the airline’s training or equipment into question. The company subjects its pilots to rigorous training and serves as a training hub for Africa and surrounding countries in the Middle East, Asia and Europe, according to the airline. “There are a lot of myths and presumptions that are made by Americans when it comes to the safety records of foreign” airlines, said Patrick Smith, a veteran airline pilot who hosts askthepilot.com. “Ethiopian Airlines is a good example of that. Because people hear Ethi­o­pia . . . they make certain unfortunate associations. Meanwhile, that carrier is one of the proudest airlines in the world, and on the whole, they have a very good safety record.” Some experts said the crash did raise questions, however, about whether Ethio­pian Airlines pilots had received training on how to disable the sensor cited in the Lion Air crash, if necessary, or whether a software update promised by Boeing to address that glitch had been installed on the Ethio­pian Airlines fleet. Boeing declined to answer any questions related to the investigation. Thomas R. Anthony, a former FAA investigator who runs the University of Southern California Aviation Safety and Security Program, cautioned against reaching conclusions too quickly, even with similarities between the crashes. Certainly, he said, the airplane being sold is no different from one country to the next. But he concurred with others who said the United States has capabilities for training and safety oversight that may factor into its decision not to ground the aircraft. “The U.S. air carriers have robust mechanisms for the distribution of the training materials and new information,” he said. “Aviation is more mature in the United States than most of the countries in the rest of the world. It has had more time to develop. Just by virtue of its size and time, the system is more mature in the United States.” Anthony said U.S. training is also more involved, requiring an FAA license and commercial flying certifications. “It is more developed, and it is more robust,” he said, noting that the United States has a technical training center in Oklahoma City, where technicians and inspectors train for years, a facility that most countries don’t have. By contrast, he said, reports including from the International Civil Aviation Organization, have found oversight lagging in countries where regulators may not have the authority or capabilities of their U.S. counterparts. “It may not be a different safety standard, but it may be a different level of capability of the authority,” Anthony said. Aircraft operations and certification are dependent upon the staffing of governmental agencies, and around the world, Anthony said, “we have found they have not been staffed adequately.” The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines comprising about 82 percent of global air traffic, declined to comment on decisions by individual carriers concerning whether to ground a particular aircraft. But a spokesman referred to IATA data released last month for the 2018 safety performance of the commercial airline industry, which showed continued safety improvements over the long term — although there was a small increase in crashes last year compared with 2017. According to the group’s ratings, there was one major crash for every 5.4 million flights involving major jets. Those included 11 fatal crashes that resulted in 523 fatalities in 2018. “Last year, some 4.3 billion passengers flew safely on 46.1 million flights. 2018 was not the extraordinary year that 2017 was,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and chief executive, said in announcing the data last month. “Flying is safe, and the data tell us that it is getting safer.” faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com luz.lazo@washpost.com	601	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 212, ""text"": ""rent responses to Sunday’s crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8, the second in less than six months, reflect how different the stakes are for the countries and airlines involved, experts and analysts said Monday."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 531, ""end"": 585, ""text"": ""the one that killed 157 people in Ethi­o­pia on Sunday"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1261, ""end"": 1417, ""text"": ""Questions about the plane were raised in October, when Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea in Indonesia killing all 189 passengers and crew aboard"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1507, ""end"": 1636, ""text"": ""Airlines and regulators in Ethi­o­pia, China and several other countries announced they were temporarily grounding the Max 8 jets"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2824, ""end"": 2973, ""text"": ""although there was strong speculation that the crash was connected to the same “angle of attack” sensor that factored into the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2975, ""end"": 3087, ""text"": ""China abruptly pulled 100 of the planes from operation through its civil aviation authority after Sunday’s crash"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3286, ""end"": 3513, ""text"": ""But the Civil Aviation Administration of China said the step was taken in “view of the fact that the two air crashes are newly delivered” 737 Max 8 planes, that both happened during takeoff and “they have certain similarities.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 531, ""end"": 585, ""text"": ""the one that killed 157 people in Ethi­o­pia on Sunday"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	580	2023-04-13T15:52:28.539749Z	2023-04-13T15:52:28.539865Z	565.361
"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has scheduled what is expected to be the first of many hearings examining the Federal Aviation Administration’s role in overseeing aviation safety in the wake of two fatal crashes that have killed more than 300 people. Cruz, chairman of the subcommittee on aviation and space, will convene a hearing on “The State of Airline Safety: Federal Oversight of Commercial Aviation,” at 3 p.m. next Wednesday. Those expected to testify include acting FAA Administrator Daniel Elwell, Calvin Scovel, inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation and Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. The FAA’s oversight of manufacturer Boeing has come under scrutiny after two high-profile crashes in less than five months involving the company’s 737 Max 8 jets. In October, a Lion Air flight crashed shortly after takeoff into the Java Sea in Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers aboard. Earlier this month, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed shortly after it left the capital city, Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. On Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao asked Scovel’s office to conduct audit of the agency’s process for certifying the aircraft. The Justice Department’s criminal division has also launched a probe focused on the 737 Max, but the scope of that investigation is not clear. Investigators are still working to determine the cause of both crashes, but preliminary information garnered from satellite tracking data identified similarities between the two incidents. The information prompted the FAA to ground the jets, a move that came after civil aviation agencies around the world had already done so. Boeing officials have said they are preparing a software update and updating pilot training manuals. The change is meant to address an automated feature of the Max jets that Indonesian investigators say may have been a factor in the Oct. 29 crash. Cruz said the committee also plans to hold a second hearing to hear from industry representatives including Boeing, other aviation manufacturers, airline pilots and other stakeholders. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said last week that he plans to hold one or more hearings on the Boeing crashes. On Tuesday, he and Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) who head the aviation subcommittee, also asked DOT’s inspector general to examine questions concerning the FAA’s approach to certifying the Max 8. ""I have a long record of fighting to ensure safety is always the priority at FAA, and given the many questions about the recent Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents, I am actively pursuing an investigation into the certification of this aircraft and the decision not to require additional pilot training. I am committed to using all of the tools at my disposal as Chairman to get answers, including hearing,” DeFazio said Wednesday. It is not clear how much new information about the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash will come out of next Wednesday’s hearing. While the NTSB is participating in the investigation, only Ethiopian authorities are authorized to discuss the probe."	600	"[{""start"": 810, ""end"": 1065, ""text"": ""In October, a Lion Air flight crashed shortly after takeoff into the Java Sea in Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers aboard.

JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesian investigators on Thursday confirmed the presence in the cockpit of an off-duty pilot reported to have saved a troubled Lion Air flight the day before the same plane crashed on Oct. 29. Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that this third pilot, who happened to have hitched a ride on the flight, figured out what was going wrong on the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft as the other pilots struggled to control the diving plane. The third pilot, according to Bloomberg News, disabled the aircraft’s flight-control system and landed the plane safely in Jakarta. The same plane then crashed the next day, killing all 189 aboard. “The third pilot, who has not been identified, was qualified to fly Max 8s and was deadheading aboard the Oct. 28 flight from Bali’s Denpasar airport to Jakarta,” said Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, referring to the practice of company employees traveling free of charge. “The aircraft encountered the same problems that appear to have caused it to crash a day later.” Soerjanto and other Indonesian authorities have not confirmed that the third pilot prevented a crash on Oct. 28. Soerjanto, however, pushed back on reports that detailed the contents of the doomed flight’s cockpit voice recorder, one of the two “black boxes” recovered after the crash. He said the reports “were not in line with the actual content,” which belongs “solely to the KNKT,” referring to the National Transportation Safety Committee by its local-language abbreviation. It was a day of pushback against media reports, with Ethio­pian Airlines — which also lost a Max 8 aircraft on March 10 — disputing reports that the pilot hadn’t received the right training. The Indonesian news conference was called Thursday afternoon local time after Reuters reported that the Lion Air 610’s pilots were scrambling to diagnose why the jet’s nose kept lurching forward, flipping through the manual as the aircraft’s altitude and airspeed varied dramatically. Reuters and later the New York Times, citing investigators who had heard the audio and transcript, said that in the final seconds of the audio, the co-pilot said “Allahu akbar,” meaning “God is great,” and a prayer.  “The KNKT believes that the reports in the media are based on someone’s opinions, or several parties’ opinion,” Soerjanto said. Nurcahyo Utomo, another investigator with the KNKT, said Indonesian laws bar investigators from publicizing the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. “Our [cockpit voice recorder content] has not leaked,” he said. After the Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed all 157 on board, investigators began noticing similarities between the two cases. The March disaster has led to the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes worldwide and ratcheted up pressure on Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration to provide answers as to what went wrong. Authorities investigating the Indonesia crash say erroneous sensor data triggered an automated anti-stall feature, known as the MCAS, in the new Max planes that pushed its nose down, ultimately causing the plane to crash into the Java Sea. In the case of the day-earlier Lion Air flight, the guest pilot was able to disable the system in time. In addition to the Oct. 28 incident, the plane had multiple failures starting Oct. 26, including the four flights before the one that crashed into the Java Sea, according to the preliminary report on the Lion Air crash. The plane’s maintenance log showed that pilots reported defects with incorrect display of speeds and altitude and that airline mechanics worked to resolve the problems. Before the near-disaster on Oct. 28, the “angle of attack” sensor, which detects whether the wings have enough lift to keep flying, was replaced, the report said. It had been tested and the captain was reassured that the previously logged maintenance problem had been resolved. Boeing then issued a November bulletin about the problem that was to be distributed to pilots along with additional training in turning off the system. The Ethiopian Airlines crash appeared to share similarities with the Lion Air case, including an erratic up-and-down flight path and the pilot reporting “flight control” problems shortly before crashing, authorities had said. Investigators in France — who are involved because they downloaded the data from the black boxes for the Ethiopians, who didn’t have the expertise — and Ethiopia then said information from the Ethiopian flight data recorder showed “clear similarities” with the Lion Air flight. On Thursday, Ethiopia’s Transport Ministry issued a statement saying the analysis of the data was underway with a team that included the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, as well as the French and European aviation safety agencies. Reuters and the New York Times also reported that the pilot in the doomed Ethio­pian Airlines flight, Yared Getachew, had not received training in the Max 8 flight simulator. Ethio­pian Airlines responded by expressing “its disappointment on the following wrong reporting of the @nytimes” in a tweet, noting that all pilots were trained in the use of the new Max 8 planes before they were introduced and were later updated about the Boeing warning in November about possible stabilizer issues. “We urge all concerned to refrain from making such uninformed, incorrect, irresponsible and misleading statements during the period of the accident investigation,” it said, adding that the flight simulator “is not designed to simulate the MCAS system problems.” paul.schemm@washpost.com	599	"[{""start"": 9, ""end"": 215, ""text"": ""donesia — Indonesian investigators on Thursday confirmed the presence in the cockpit of an off-duty pilot reported to have saved a troubled Lion Air flight the day before the same plane crashed on Oct. 29"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 217, ""end"": 446, ""text"": ""Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that this third pilot, who happened to have hitched a ride on the flight, figured out what was going wrong on the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft as the other pilots struggled to control the diving plane"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 448, ""end"": 644, ""text"": ""he third pilot, according to Bloomberg News, disabled the aircraft’s flight-control system and landed the plane safely in Jakarta. The same plane then crashed the next day, killing all 189 aboard"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 448, ""end"": 644, ""text"": ""The third pilot, according to Bloomberg News, disabled the aircraft’s flight-control system and landed the plane safely in Jakarta. The same plane then crashed the next day, killing all 189 aboard"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1550, ""end"": 1739, ""text"": ""It was a day of pushback against media reports, with Ethio­pian Airlines — which also lost a Max 8 aircraft on March 10 — disputing reports that the pilot hadn’t received the right training"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2587, ""end"": 2718, ""text"": ""After the Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed all 157 on board, investigators began noticing similarities between the two cases."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2719, ""end"": 2920, ""text"": ""The March disaster has led to the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes worldwide and ratcheted up pressure on Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration to provide answers as to what went wrong"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2922, ""end"": 3160, ""text"": ""Authorities investigating the Indonesia crash say erroneous sensor data triggered an automated anti-stall feature, known as the MCAS, in the new Max planes that pushed its nose down, ultimately causing the plane to crash into the Java Sea"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4085, ""end"": 4310, ""text"": ""The Ethiopian Airlines crash appeared to share similarities with the Lion Air case, including an erratic up-and-down flight path and the pilot reporting “flight control” problems shortly before crashing, authorities had said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4311, ""end"": 4588, ""text"": ""Investigators in France — who are involved because they downloaded the data from the black boxes for the Ethiopians, who didn’t have the expertise — and Ethiopia then said information from the Ethiopian flight data recorder showed “clear similarities” with the Lion Air flight."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4830, ""end"": 5322, ""text"": ""Reuters and the New York Times also reported that the pilot in the doomed Ethio­pian Airlines flight, Yared Getachew, had not received training in the Max 8 flight simulator.

JAKARTA, Indonesia — A malfunctioning sensor and an automated response from the aircraft’s software stymied pilots’ efforts to control a doomed Indonesian flight that went careening into the sea last month, according to a preliminary investigative report released Wednesday.  The report, which stops short of determining the cause of the crash or analyzing findings, chronicles the chaotic moments on the Lion Air flight before it crashed into the waters off the coast of Java last month, killing all 189 passengers and crew on board. It details how sensors and other equipment were checked and fixed before the aircraft’s final flight, but not the “angle of attack” sensor. That measures where the nose is pointing and was showing erroneous readings throughout the short time the plane was airborne.  With the sensor insisting the nose was too high, an automatic feature kicked in, sending the plane plummeting as the pilots wrestled to regain control. Unable to trust their readings, the pilots resorted to asking air traffic control about their speed and altitude. Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 just after taking off from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killing the eight crew members and 181 passengers on board, including a child and two infants.  The crash appears to have been caused by a mix of brand new technology and cockpit confusion as the pilots fought to gain altitude after an early-morning takeoff from Jakarta. The flight crew — at an altitude of just 5,000 feet — had very little time to resolve the issue before the plane crashed into the sea at a reported 450 miles per hour. Though the report contains no conclusion assigning blame, its descriptions of automated systems overtaking the aircraft — leaving pilots both confused and powerless — poses questions for Boeing and Lion Air about whether the cockpit crew was prepared for this scenario. After the Lion Air crash, pilots in the United States accused Boeing of withholding safety information on its new 737 model. The aircraft’s pilots asked to return to Jakarta just two minutes after takeoff, reporting a “flight-control problem” but not specifying what it was.  Black-box data released by Indonesian investigators showed that the pilots were pulling back on the control column, attempting to raise the plane’s nose, with almost 100 pounds of pressure before they crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, which produced the report, also said that Lion Air, a Jakarta-based low-cost airline, should improve its “safety culture.” No engineer briefed the pilots of the crashed plane on the multiple problems the aircraft experienced on previous flights, and it was up to him to review the maintenance logs. The report, however, contains no conclusion on who was at fault. “When it comes to faulting, I don’t know. Our job isn’t to find faults,” National Transportation Safety Committee investigator Nurcahyo Utomo said at a news conference Wednesday. The aircraft was the most recent incarnation of the venerable Boeing 737, a plane that first flew in 1967 and has gone through multiple iterations before it emerged as the 737 Max. The 737 Max was equipped with more-powerful engines that are mounted farther forward on the wing, requiring that additional software be added to the auto­pilot to provide more control. That software, which has been described as several lines of coding, was identified in the Boeing manual as the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS. When the sensors transmitted faulty data to the cockpit of Flight 610, the new MCAS system sensed a stall — that point at which planes do not have enough airspeed to create lift — and sought to correct for it by repeatedly pointing the nose of the aircraft down. A feature in previous 737 models that allowed pilots to manually override an “electric trimming” process — which automatically budges the nose downward to prevent a stall, does not work in Boeing’s 737 Max 8 planes, Boeing explained in a Nov. 7 bulletin.  That same week, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency notice to all airlines that fly the 737 Max, warning them that erroneous sensor inputs “could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,” leading to “possible impact with terrain.” The deviation probably was caused by what is called a “runaway stabilizer.” Stabilizers are essentially those small wings on either side at the tail end of the plane. They each have flaps — called elevators — that help control the elevation of the plane.  In case of a runaway stabilizer, pilots are instructed in the cockpit checklist to hold the control column firmly, disengaging the auto­pilot that, in this case, contained the MCAS program. Next, they are told, disengage the auto throttle and manually fly the plane. “This corner of the performance charts is called the ‘coffin corner,’ ” said Mary Schiavo, an aviation lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department, “and good pilot training teaches you how to get out of coffin corner, but did these pilots realize the plane itself was putting them in coffin corner? Apparently not.” It is not clear whether the pilots attempted the runaway stabilizer procedure. Unions representing pilots at Southwest and American airlines said they were not properly informed about the new system during training. “We did not know this was on the Max models,” Southwest Airlines Pilots Association President Jon Weaks told The Washington Post in a Nov. 13 interview, referring to a new automated flight-control feature. The prospect that a runaway autopilot system could have contributed to the crash has already been the subject of at least one lawsuit implicating Boeing, with the father of a Lion Air Flight 610 crash victim filing suit recently. Soerjanto Tjahjono, who heads Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, said last week that the plane’s black box showed that “the technical problem was the airspeed, or the speed of the plane.” (The plane’s cockpit voice recorder has not been recovered.) “There were four flights that experienced problems with the airspeed indicator,” Tjahjono said. The angle-of-attack sensor contributes to the airspeed readings. In testimony before the Indonesian parliament last week, Utomo, the investigator, said that the anti-stall system had activated on the plane as it flew into Jakarta the night before the crash but that the pilots managed to shut it off. At the news conference Wednesday, Utomo said the plane, on both the doomed flight and the previous flight from Bali to Jakarta, had experienced a stick shaker — “a warning that showed that the plane was going to stall,” he said. The committee report said differing data between the sensors appeared rectified by cleaning an electrical plug the night before the crash, and a “test on the ground found the problem had been solved.” But it was not, the report concludes, because when the plane took off shortly after 6 a.m. the following morning, the two flight-speed sensors did not agree on the aircraft’s speed. The 737 Max is the most popular plane in Boeing history, with 453 delivered so far and 4,671 on order. It is flown or is on order by close to 40 airlines, with Lion Air in the process of receiving more than 200 of the jets. Boeing said Tuesday that it “continues to work closely with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as technical advisers to support the ongoing investigation” by the Indonesian authorities. The flights of Indonesia’s airlines to U.S. destinations were banned in the decade before 2016 because their safety record was considered abysmal by U.S. standards. The crash of the Lion Air flight was the worst in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on the national airline Garuda in North Sumatra.  ashley.halsey@washpost.com aaron.gregg@washpost.com	598	"[{""start"": 9, ""end"": 273, ""text"": ""onesia — A malfunctioning sensor and an automated response from the aircraft’s software stymied pilots’ efforts to control a doomed Indonesian flight that went careening into the sea last month, according to a preliminary investigative report released Wednesday"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 276, ""end"": 533, ""text"": ""The report, which stops short of determining the cause of the crash or analyzing findings, chronicles the chaotic moments on the Lion Air flight before it crashed into the waters off the coast of Java last month, killing all 189 passengers and crew on board"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 535, ""end"": 952, ""text"": ""t details how sensors and other equipment were checked and fixed before the aircraft’s final flight, but not the “angle of attack” sensor.

A Lion Air passenger plane that took off Monday from Jakarta, Indonesia’s largest city, heading to a nearby island crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff with 189 people on board in clear skies, launching a grim mission to find unlikely survivors and remains from the deep waters.  Rescuers began pulling out debris from the depths of the sea, including parts of the aircraft’s fuselage, ID cards and bags belonging to the passengers on board. People at an offshore refining facility nearby also found remains of the aircraft, including plane seats, in the water. Officials say they have received no confirmation that anyone has survived.  “We are waiting for a miracle of God,” said Nugroho Budi Wiryanto, deputy operations chief at the national search-and-rescue agency. At least 300 rescuers have been deployed from the agency, he said, and are still searching for the main body of the plane. Lion Air JT-610 lost contact with air traffic officials and fell from over 3,000 feet about 13 minutes after takeoff, plunging into the sea below, officials said, adding that people on a nearby tugboat watched the plane descend. The air traffic websites FlightAware and Flightradar24 showed the plane climbing erratically, barely reaching above 5,000 feet, before quickly dropping and disappearing from radar. Among those on board were two pilots, six flight attendants and two babies. Twenty employees from Indonesia’s Finance Ministry were also on board.  Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s national disaster agency, shared a video on Twitter of rescuers on tugboats looking for debris off the coast of Karawang, an area in West Java close to Jakarta. He also shared photos of mangled cellphones and a torn bag that rescuers recovered. Rescuers will also dive to find debris and remains in the sea, which has a depth of about 114 feet.  The aircraft, a Boeing 737 Max 8, was purchased this year by Lion Air, Southeast Asia’s second-largest low-cost airline. The plane is one of Boeing’s newest, and had flown several hundred hours since Lion Air started operating it on Aug. 15. It departed at 6:21 a.m. local time and was scheduled to arrive about 7:20 a.m. at Pangkal Pinang, the largest city on the nearby Indonesian island of Bangka. Boeing said it had received confirmation that the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation had located the wreckage of the flight. “The Boeing Company is deeply saddened by the loss of Flight JT 610. We express our concern for those on board, and extend heartfelt sympathies to their families and loved ones,” a company statement read. “Boeing stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation.” A crisis center has been set up at Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and the Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinangfor families of passengers and crew members on the plane, said Pramintohadi Soekarno, the acting director general of civil aviation.  The flight was commanded by Capt. Bhavye Suneja, who had more than 6,000 flight hours, and his co-pilot, who had more than 5,000 hours, officials said. Indonesian officials and experts say the exact cause of the crash will not be clear until flight data, particularly from the plane’s black box, is retrieved. An estimated location of the black box has been identified, and divers are searching for it. A statement from Indonesia’s Transport Ministry said the plane had requested to return to base before it lost contact. Skies were clear and there were no abnormalities in the weather. Aircraft makers and carriers have long prized Indonesia as one of the region’s fastest growing aviation market, with a rising middle-class. Air travel is a necessity to dart across Indonesia’s large archipelago of islands. Domestic passenger traffic has tripled over the past 12 years to 97 million in 2017. But the country has long received mixed reviews on airline safety, and all its airlines were only removed from the European Union’s air safety list and deemed safe to travel on this June. Lion Air was allowed to fly in E.U. air space in 2016. Lion Air, established in 1999, is Indonesia’s largest budget airline. It has been involved in a number of incidents in recent years, but none with fatalities. One of its jets collided with a plane from another carrier, Wings Air, on the island of Sumatra last year but no one was injured. In 2013, a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea after landing on the resort island of Bali. Several were injured, but no one was killed.  In 2004, a Lion Air plane skid off the runway in heavy rains when it landed in the city of Solo, killing 31. shibani.mahtani@washpost.com	597	"[{""start"": 2, ""end"": 283, ""text"": ""n Air passenger plane that took off Monday from Jakarta, Indonesia’s largest city, heading to a nearby island crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff with 189 people on board in clear skies, launching a grim mission to find unlikely survivors and remains from the deep waters"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 900, ""end"": 1309, ""text"": ""Lion Air JT-610 lost contact with air traffic officials and fell from over 3,000 feet about 13 minutes after takeoff, plunging into the sea below, officials said, adding that people on a nearby tugboat watched the plane descend.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — ­Ethiopia’s transport minister said Sunday that information from the flight data recorder on the Ethio­pian Airlines jet that crashed March 10 shows “clear similarities” to the crash of the same type of plane in Indonesia in October. Dagmawit Moges told journalists that the condition of the “black boxes” — the data and voice recorders — was good and that enough data had been recovered that her ministry’s Accident Investigation Bureau would release a preliminary report in 30 days on what happened to Flight 302. “During the investigation of the FDR [flight data recorder], clear similarities were noted between Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610, which will be the subject of further investigation,” Dagmawit said. Initial data from the ill-fated Ethiopian Airlines flight as well as subsequent satellite information recovered showed an erratic flight path during the six minutes that the plane was in the air before it crashed into a field outside the capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 aboard. The plane ascended and descended and then ascended again, all the while flying at speeds well in excess of normal takeoff procedure. The pilot, Yared Getachew, was considered very experienced, with more than 8,000 hours of flying time. There were enough similarities to the crash of the Lion Air jet in Indonesia in October, which also involved a Boeing 737 Max 8, that authorities around the world grounded the plane. The voice and data recorders were taken by Ethio­pian investigators on Thursday to France, where they are being analyzed by the Bureau of Inquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety. Dagmawit said the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board also was involved in the analysis. A preliminary report about the causes of the Lion Air crash pointed to erroneous data from a sensor causing the aircraft’s new automated stabilizer system to push the jet’s nose down. The pilots struggled to pull the plane up, and it crashed into the sea. The minister’s comments Sunday suggested that a similar series of events may have caused the Ethio­pian Airlines crash. In November, Boeing issued a bulletin on how to reset the stabilizer if it started to push the plane’s nose down. paul.schemm@washpost.com	596	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 259, ""text"": ""ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — ­Ethiopia’s transport minister said Sunday that information from the flight data recorder on the Ethio­pian Airlines jet that crashed March 10 shows “clear similarities” to the crash of the same type of plane in Indonesia in October."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 775, ""end"": 1058, ""text"": ""Initial data from the ill-fated Ethiopian Airlines flight as well as subsequent satellite information recovered showed an erratic flight path during the six minutes that the plane was in the air before it crashed into a field outside the capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 aboard."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1059, ""end"": 1191, ""text"": ""he plane ascended and descended and then ascended again, all the while flying at speeds well in excess of normal takeoff procedure."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1295, ""end"": 1476, ""text"": ""There were enough similarities to the crash of the Lion Air jet in Indonesia in October, which also involved a Boeing 737 Max 8, that authorities around the world grounded the plane"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1759, ""end"": 1941, ""text"": ""A preliminary report about the causes of the Lion Air crash pointed to erroneous data from a sensor causing the aircraft’s new automated stabilizer system to push the jet’s nose down"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1943, ""end"": 2134, ""text"": ""The pilots struggled to pull the plane up, and it crashed into the sea.

JAKARTA, Indonesia — Rescuers pulled mangled body parts out of the Java Sea on Monday as officials here scrambled to uncover what went wrong on a nearly brand-new Boeing jet operated by Lion Air that crashed, likely killing all 189 onboard. No clear explanation has emerged about what had caused the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff. Skies were clear. The Boeing 737 Max 8 had been in service for two months and had flown just 800 hours.  The aircraft’s pilot had asked to return to Jakarta’s airport shortly after takeoff, and his request was cleared by air traffic controllers. The plane then lost contact with controllers and plunged into the sea from 3,000 feet. Authorities quickly launched a search-and-rescue mission but later said they did not expect to find any survivors. Throughout the day Monday, rescuers pulled debris out of the sea, including parts of the aircraft’s fuselage, ID cards and bags belonging to the passengers. Bodies and body parts were being recovered and sent to a hospital for identification. People at an offshore refining facility nearby also found remnants of the aircraft, including plane seats, in the water. Officials said they have received no confirmation that anyone survived.  “My prediction is that no one has survived, because none of the victims have been found” intact, said Bambang Suryo Aji, the national search-and-rescue agency’s director of operations. Nine body bags, filled with parts of the victims’ bodies, were taken to the hospital. Fifteen ships are looking for the plane’s main section and the victims, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said at an evening news conference Monday at Jakarta’s airport. More than 300 rescuers have been deployed from the search-and-rescue agency. Among them are 30 divers plunging deep into the water to find the remaining parts of the fuselage, the bodies and the plane’s black box, with the aid of underwater robots and sonar technology. Indonesia is one of the region’s fastest-growing aviation markets — air travel is a necessity to dart across the large archipelago — but the country has long had a mixed record on airline safety. Its airlines were banned from flying to the United States in 2007 because they were “deficient in one or more areas, such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping, or inspection procedures.” The Federal Aviation Administration lifted the ban in 2016 after the country’s airlines showed signs of improvement. The European Union similarly barred Indonesian carriers from flying into European airspace from 2007 until June. Lion Air, Indonesia’s largest budget airline, controls over 50 percent of the market share, according to the Center for Aviation, an aviation market intelligence firm.  Lion Air Flight 610 lost contact with air traffic officials and fell about 13 minutes after takeoff, officials said. People on a nearby tugboat watched the plane descend. The air traffic websites FlightAware and Flightradar24 showed the plane climbing erratically, barely reaching above 5,000 feet, before quickly dropping and disappearing from radar.  In a news conference, Lion Air Group’s chief executive, Edward Sirait, said the plane, a new model from Boeing, had a technical issue on a previous flight that was resolved “according to procedure.” He did not give details. “Let the authorities investigate what happened to it,” he added, refusing to speculate on the cause. “But I made sure that this plane was released to fly by our engineers.”   Among those onboard were two pilots, six flight attendants and two babies, as well as 20 employees from Indonesia’s Finance Ministry. One of the passengers was Italian, and the rest were Indonesian nationals. The pilot, Captain Bhavye Suneja, was from India and had more than 6,000 flight hours, and his co-pilot had more than 5,000 hours. In New Delhi, the pilot’s grieving relatives gathered in the living room of his parents’ house on a narrow street in Mayur Vihar, a middle-class residential neighborhood in the eastern part of the city. Family members declined to speak to reporters.  Anil Gupta, a neighbor, said Suneja had moved abroad several years earlier but returned each fall to spend the Hindu festival of Diwali with his family. Suneja had “wanted to be a pilot since he was a child,” Gupta said. “There was so much love for him on this street.”  By Monday afternoon, distraught family members had begun streaming into a crisis center set up in Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Another was established at the plane’s never-reached destination at Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang, a tin-mining region.  Many relatives had heard the news of the crash and rushed to the airport, the reality of the improbable search for survivors slowly sinking in.  Among them was Fitri Sagala, 47, whose brother-in-law, Mangatur Sihombing, boarded Flight 610 that morning. She was at the crisis center with her sister, Mangatur’s wife.  “I’m at a loss,” she said, explaining that she was a widow and that her brother-in-law was her main provider. “I lost my husband, so he was caring for me and my children.”  James Sianturi, 57, fought back tears as he spoke about his son, 26-year-old Jandri, who was also on the flight. He was on his way back to Pangkal Pinang, where he worked at a bank. Jandri moved his flight to Monday morning from Sunday to spend an extra day in the city with his fiancee, who works in Jakarta. They were due to marry in May 2019.  “Only God knows what his condition is, and hopefully, God grants a miracle to my son,” he said. The aircraft, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, was purchased this year by Lion Air, Southeast Asia’s second-largest low-cost airline. The plane is one of Boeing’s newest and had flown several hundred hours since Lion Air started operating it on Aug. 15. It departed at 6:21 a.m. local time and was scheduled to arrive about 7:20 a.m. at Pangkal Pinang, the largest city on the Indonesian island of Bangka. “The Boeing Company is deeply saddened by the loss of Flight JT 610. We express our concern for those on board, and extend heartfelt sympathies to their families and loved ones,” the company said in a statement. “Boeing stands ready to provide technical assistance to the accident investigation.” Investors reacted sharply to the news: Boeing’s share price dropped nearly 7 percent Monday after the crash. Lion Air has emerged as an important international customer for the aerospace giant. According to records maintained by the aerospace consulting firm Boyd Group International, Lion has 205 open orders for Boeing 737 models, though that pipeline includes only one MAX 8 model that hasn’t yet been delivered. Earlier this year, Lion announced it would buy 50 new MAX 10 models. Lion Air has been involved in a number of incidents in the past few years, but none with fatalities. One of its jets collided with a plane from another carrier, Wings Air, on the island of Sumatra last year, but no one was injured. In 2013, a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea after landing on the resort island of Bali. Several were injured, but no one was killed.  In 2004, a Lion Air plane skidded off the runway in heavy rains when it landed in the city of Solo, killing 31. If all the passengers and crew on the aircraft have died, it would be the country’s second-worst disaster since 1997, when a Garuda airlines plane crashed close to the city of Medan, killing all 234 people onboard.  shibani.mahtani@washpost.com	595	"[{""start"": 9, ""end"": 239, ""text"": ""sia — Rescuers pulled mangled body parts out of the Java Sea on Monday as officials here scrambled to uncover what went wrong on a nearly brand-new Boeing jet operated by Lion Air that crashed, likely killing all 189 onboard"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 241, ""end"": 677, ""text"": ""No clear explanation has emerged about what had caused the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff.

As President Trump consulted with administration officials Wednesday over whether Boeing’s 737 Max jetliners should be grounded after a crash killed more than 150 passengers in Ethiopia over the weekend, he shared his pointed opinion of the type of plane in question. In his words, it “sucked.” The president said Boeing 737s paled in comparison to the Boeing 757, known as Trump Force One, which he owns as a personal jet, according to White House and transportation officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He questioned why Boeing would keep building the model and opined that he never would have bought a 737 for the Trump Shuttle, the small airline he briefly ran three decades ago that relied on 727s before going bankrupt, the officials said. Later in the day, Trump agreed with his aides that the Federal Aviation Administration, as the industry regulator, should formally announce the decision to ground the 737 Max planes, according to two White House officials. But when reporters were brought into the White House for a previously scheduled immigration event, he scrapped the plan. “We’re going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and the planes associated with that line,” Trump announced, catching some industry officials by surprise. The chaotic scene capped a harried three-day period in which the United States lagged almost every other major country in deciding how to respond to an Ethi­o­pian Airlines crash early Sunday, highlighting the Trump administration’s close ties to Boeing and its difficulty asserting itself as a global leader in the wake of a tragedy. As governments in China, Australia, the European Union and elsewhere were moving to ground the 737 Max plane on Monday and Tuesday, Trump and his administration were in a holding pattern. The president held daily phone calls with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and other stakeholders, offering his self-proclaimed expertise in public and private. On Twitter, he declared that “airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.” Trump added to the confusion Wednesday by suggesting that the decision to ground the plane was “psychologically” important but was neither urgent nor conclusive. “We didn’t have to make this decision today. We could have delayed it,” he said Wednesday. “We maybe didn’t have to make it at all. But I felt it was important both psychologically and in a lot of other ways.” The equivocation reflected an administration that was reluctant to take the step of imposing a nationwide suspension initially opposed by Boeing, the country’s second-largest federal contractor. Trump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him. Federal regulators usually take the lead on making decisions related to safety, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. “It’s not the president’s decision and it should never be the president’s decision,” he said, adding that he did not know whether Trump broke any protocols. On Tuesday, as a growing number of countries were grounding the planes, Trump spoke to Muilenburg, who argued in favor of keeping the planes in the sky, according to a senior administration official. Boeing was facing increasing global pressure after reports showed that pilots had complained about the plane’s automation system. On Tuesday night, officials said, Trump was given satellite data that indicated the same 737 Max automation system believed to be responsible for a crash in Indonesia last year that killed more than 180 people may have played a role in Sunday’s accident. By Wednesday morning, officials said, Trump had also seen information about the crash from the Canadian government, which then announced it was grounding the model, leaving the U.S. as the only major country where the aircraft was being allowed to operate. “We were coordinating with Canada,” Trump said Wednesday. “We were giving them information, they were giving us information.” Throughout the process, Trump played the role of aviation expert, despite having no formal training in aeronautics. Trump told advisers about the dynamics and equipment of various airplanes, comparing them to his 757. “He was very much engaged in this,” one official said. Trump, who claims to have personally renegotiated Boeing’s contract to build Air Force One, relinquished his failed Trump Shuttle between Boston, New York and Washington in 1991 after never making a profit. His criticism of the 737 — the best-selling jetliner model in history — came just weeks after he attended an event in Hanoi celebrating Vietnam’s purchase of 100 of the Boeing jets. Trump expressed condolences Wednesday for the victims of the Ethi­o­pia crash. “Our hearts go out to all of those who lost loved ones, to their friends, to their families, in both the Ethiopian and Lion Airlines that involved the 737 Max aircraft,” Trump said Wednesday. “It’s a terrible, terrible thing.” In deciding to ground the Boeing model, Trump said that Muilenburg, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell were “all in agreement.” Daniel Wells, who sits on the board of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, said Trump should not have been the person making the announcement. “The president isn’t the right person to do it. Elwell or Chao should have made the announcement,” said Wells, whose 30,000-member group did not call for the planes to be grounded. “But it was Trump who said it. That tells you everything you need to know.” Boeing, which as late as Tuesday said publicly it saw no reason to ground the planes, announced soon after Trump made his move that it had recommended the grounding. “We are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution,” Muilenburg said in a statement. “We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.” Boeing has a long history of developing close relationships with U.S. presidents. In 2015, President Obama told Seattle TV station KING-TV that he was probably the second-biggest global salesman for Boeing, which he called “an iconic company.” The company donated $1 million each to the inaugural funds of Trump and Obama. Boeing has an especially close relationship with the Trump administration, which has recruited several company executives for senior posts, including acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. Muilenburg has courted Trump at the White House, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., and at Trump Tower in New York. Trump has twice visited Boeing facilities and praised the company’s aircraft. “God bless Boeing,” Trump said after touring a company facility in Charleston, S.C., in February 2017. “Great planes,” he told reporters while visiting a St. Louis facility in March 2018. “Incredible. Great company.” He has also personally pitched the company’s planes in meetings with world leaders from Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries. “Greatest commercial aircraft in the world,” he said in November 2017 while meeting with Japanese business leaders. He noted that after the United States, Japan is the largest owner of Boeing aircraft. Trump also offered a dose of praise for the company as he made his announcement grounding its plane. “Boeing is an incredible company,” he said. “They are working very, very hard right now. And hopefully they will very quickly come up with the answer. But until they do, the planes are grounded.” toluse.olorunnipa@washpost.com josh.dawsey@washpost.com	594	"[{""start"": 794, ""end"": 1016, ""text"": ""Later in the day, Trump agreed with his aides that the Federal Aviation Administration, as the industry regulator, should formally announce the decision to ground the 737 Max planes, according to two White House officials."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1138, ""end"": 1360, ""text"": ""“We’re going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and the planes associated with that line,” Trump announced, catching some industry officials by surprise"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1697, ""end"": 1884, ""text"": ""As governments in China, Australia, the European Union and elsewhere were moving to ground the 737 Max plane on Monday and Tuesday, Trump and his administration were in a holding pattern."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3342, ""end"": 3413, ""text"": ""On Tuesday, as a growing number of countries were grounding the planes,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3672, ""end"": 3926, ""text"": ""On Tuesday night, officials said, Trump was given satellite data that indicated the same 737 Max automation system believed to be responsible for a crash in Indonesia last year that killed more than 180 people may have played a role in Sunday’s accident."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5864, ""end"": 6317, ""text"": ""Boeing, which as late as Tuesday said publicly it saw no reason to ground the planes, announced soon after Trump made his move that it had recommended the grounding. “We are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution,” Muilenburg said in a statement. “We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 7778, ""end"": 7928, ""text"": ""They are working very, very hard right now.

"Editor’s note: An earlier version of this report carried a headline that mischaracterized a Boeing official’s statement regarding federal oversight. The official rejected calls for an overhaul of the company’s airplane development process, not its work with regulators. The headline has been corrected. RENTON, WASH. ― Boeing executives on Wednesday defended the safety of the company’s 737 Max commercial jetliner as it met with representatives from a broad swath of the global aviation industry. In its most detailed briefing yet, Boeing executives took a conciliatory tone about the loss of life from two deadly crashes involving the 737 Max. But the company rejected calls to overhaul its aircraft development process. It also offered more information about software and training fixes it is planning to roll out. Officials from the Chicago-based aerospace giant said the 737 Max was the culmination of 50 years of aircraft development in which safety has been the first priority. The executives also defended the airplane safety certification process that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have in place, an issue that is the subject of congressional inquiries, a Department of Transportation audit and a criminal probe by the Department of Justice. When asked whether the company needed to make changes to its airplane development process, a Boeing executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: “The process that we follow with our regulators has continued to lead to safer and safer airplanes and safer and safer operations over time.” He added: “Right now I would be very careful about indicting any part of that process until we know more about the specifics of either one of these accidents. In general the process has worked and continues to work, and we see no reason to overhaul the process.” After publication of this story, Gordon Johndroe, a company spokesman, said the Boeing executive was referring to the company’s internal “airplane development process and its long track record for producing safe airplanes” not the safety certification process with regulators. “Boeing would not ‘reject’ oversight or other enhancements the aviation community agreed would improve safety, and no representative of Boeing suggested otherwise. As we said earlier this week, we look forward to working with all regulators to advance our shared goal of an aviation industry that is safe and trusted by the flying public,” Johndroe said. The gathering here in this city, which is just a few miles south of downtown Seattle, took place in an office park near Boeing’s 737 assembly plant. Mike Sinnett, Boeing vice president of engineering and chief project engineer for the 737 program, said the company had been “deeply affected by the tragic loss of life” in Ethiopia. ""We are going to do everything we can to make sure that accidents like this never happen again,” Sinnett told a packed room of 67 media professionals. The statement echoed one from chief executive Dennis Muilenburg in the days after the Lion Air Max 8 crash in Indonesia in October. Safety concerns over the 737 Max emerged around the world after March 10 when a Boeing Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff, killing 157. It came just months after another Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia under similar circumstances, killing 189. The FAA concluded, based on satellite data and evidence from the wreckage, that the two accidents had enough in common that global fleets of the Max 8 should be grounded. At issue is a Boeing decision to add a flight control system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, into the 737 Max 8 without detailing it in pilot training. The possibility that MCAS, in combination with faulty data fed in through external sensors, could cause pilots to lose control at a critical moment has shaken the confidence of global regulators. Pilots were concerned that they did not have enough information about how to override MCAS. Sinnett on Wednesday called the 737 a tried-and-tested aircraft with safety standards honed through decades of improvements. “The 737 is a safe airplane,” Sinnett said. “The 737 family is a safe airplane family, and the 737 MAX builds on that history of safety that we have seen for almost 50 years.” The briefing, before a phalanx of television cameras, occurred before the company met with more than 200 pilots, technical leaders, airline representatives and regulators ― all of whom have a stake in the 737 Max, which has been grounded in the United States, Europe and China for almost two weeks. Boeing is working to drum up support for a flight control system overhaul and a new pilot training regimen that it hopes will allay safety concerns raised by pilot groups and others. It plans to submit the final software fixes to the FAA for review this week, something that could hasten the process of lifting the FAA grounding order. Sinnett, an aerospace engineer, described highly technical updates to the 737 MAX’s flight control systems. He stressed that the electric trim process that is part of the automated MCAS system can be overridden by pilots seeking to take manual control of the aircraft, something that has concerned pilot groups. He detailed a set of new flight control features in which an alert will appear at the bottom of the pilots’ display screen when two of the plane’s external sensors are capturing different measurements, something that could indicate faulty data. Sinnett also said that, under the new system, pulling on the plane’s control column “will always be able to override MCAS inputs with sufficient maneuvering capability that the plane can still climb,” addressing a criticism raised by pilots in early November. The company is also rolling out additional training for 737 Max pilots. Under current rules, pilots have to take an intensive 21-day training regimen. But once a pilot is completes that 737 course, the process for graduating to a newer 737 model is relatively short: Despite substantial changes to the plane’s engine size and placement, and the addition of the MCAS flight control system, training for the 737 Max had consisted primarily of a roughly hour-long, computer-based course. The training for the 737 MAX now will consist of another brief computer-based training course that walks pilots through how the MCAS system operates, as well as additions to pilot manuals and a supplemental pilot bulletin. Though the new training is not yet finalized, two pilots familiar with Boeing’s discussions said the additional computer-based course would take only 15 minutes. It is up to airlines to decide whether pilots should train on flight simulators specific to the 737 Max. “All 737 Max pilots will need to complete this training prior to engaging in the 737 Max,” Sinnett said. While Boeing hosted its meetings in Renton, lawmakers on Capitol Hill held a Senate hearing on aviation safety and oversight. Among those testifying were Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and Calvin L. Scovel III, the Transportation Department’s inspector general. Several foreign airlines expecting 737 MAX deliveries, including Virgin Australia, the United Arab Emirates’ FlyDubai, and India’s SpiceJet, said they sent representatives to Renton. “Virgin Australia will be sending two of its most senior flight operations team members to Seattle for an information session on the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, and we look forward to hearing what Boeing has to say,” a Virgin Australia spokeswoman said. “We remain firm in our position that we won’t receive any new aircraft into our fleet until we are completely satisfied with their safety.” American Airlines, United and Southwest — the three U.S. carriers that were flying 737 Max 8 or 9 jets at the time they were grounded — also said company officials would be present. “[Southwest Airlines] is eager to hear Boeing’s update as we await additional guidance from the FAA,” spokeswoman Brandy King said Tuesday. Analysts say the financial toll on Boeing and its airline customers could grow as the crisis goes on. Boeing has suspended all future deliveries of the 737 Max 8 and 9 for as long as the grounding order is in place. In a worst-cast scenario, analysts estimate the grounding order could cost the company $5 billion. Those with future orders are waiting on a resolution. WestJet, which has two Max deliveries expected later this year, said it sent pilots to the Renton meeting Wednesday. “As the duration of the Max grounding is still unknown, if our next delivery is before the grounding is lifted, we will not take the aircraft,” a WestJet spokesman said Tuesday. “However, if the grounding has been lifted and the aircraft is approved for reentry into service by all relevant regulatory bodies, we will take all deliveries as intended.” Boeing and the FAA have been working on the software and training fixes for months, but it is unclear why both organizations waited until after a second crash to publicly commit to them. A Boeing official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said the company has used lab and flight simulators to test how the new software would work in different scenarios, all of it in close coordination with FAA officials. Boeing flight-tested the software on a Boeing jet on Feb. 7 and again on March 12, the person said. “Test pilots flew different maneuvers and flight conditions that exercised various aspects of the software update,” the Boeing executive said. The second test came two days after a second Max 8 jet crashed, this time in Ethiopia.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — A new piece of evidence found by investigators on the ground here suggests the Ethi­o­pian Airlines flight that crashed Sunday may have had a problem with a new flight-control system also suspected in the crash of a Lion Air flight in October. It is the second piece of information suggesting similarities between the two crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets. Investigators found a device known as a jackscrew in the wreckage. The jackscrew, used to set the trim that raises and lowers the plane’s nose, indicates the jet was configured to dive, according to John Cox, a former pilot and an airline-safety consultant with the Washington-based aviation-safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems. Cox, formerly the top safety official for the Air Line Pilots Association, said he was privately briefed on the evidence Thursday by people familiar with the investigation. “All we can say definitely is that the trim was in a position similar to the position found on the Lion Air airplane and it would cause the nose to go down,” he said. “This will be consistent with a nose-down flight path, which they think is likely with the Ethiopian airplane. “It points to one central link,” Cox said. “We need the data from the flight data recorders. We need it as quickly as possible. . . . The faster that we get that information, it will let everyone know what needs to be done. We don’t know in fact if these accidents are related. There are some similarities.” Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, cited newly refined satellite tracking data and evidence recovered from the wreckage site as factors in his decision to ground the jets Wednesday. That data also showed similarities to the Lion Air flight. Cox said he believes the jackscrew is the new evidence Elwell was citing. Meanwhile, French aviation experts began work Friday on the plane’s heavily damaged data and voice recorders. Officials with France’s Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses, which has extensive experience analyzing crashes in Europe, said that work to retrieve information from the flight data recorder of the Boeing 737 Max 8 has begun in coordination with the Ethio­pian investigation team. President Trump spoke by telephone with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Friday to again express his condolences and underscore the United States’ commitment to work with Ethio­pian and international civil aviation authorities on the investigation. Eight Americans were among the 157 killed in the crash. The focus now, however, is on the two “black boxes” that arrived in France on Thursday. Germany had earlier turned down the opportunity to examine the recorders. The data extracted from the recorders will be used to reconstruct the six-minute flight before the plane crashed in a farm field about 40 miles from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew members. That data includes the voice communication of the pilots and the readings of the various sensors. Officials from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which sent three investigators, the FAA, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Boeing also are assisting in the probe. Experts say it typically takes almost a month to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data in the recorders, but at least some early information could be available within 24 to 48 hours. Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart, who also is a pilot, said the jackscrew, combined with data gathered from the plane’s black box, could give investigators a sense of the plane’s flying position before the crash. “By knowing the stabilizer and elevator position they know what kind of forces the plane was experiencing in the moment,” he said. In a preliminary investigation, the crash of a Lion Air Max 8 plane into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 was attributed to a faulty sensor causing an automated system to push the nose of the plane down. The possibility that the same scenario occurred in Ethiopia has prompted precautionary groundings of the plane all over the world. In all, more than 300 people have died in the two crashes involving the Max 8 jet. Preliminary flight data showed the Ethio­pian Airlines plane in trouble almost immediately and struggling to gain altitude in the high thin air above the Addis Ababa airport. The plane descended and then sharply ascended, while moving at speeds far in excess of normal. Within minutes the pilot radioed the control tower reporting “flight control” problems and was given clearance to return. In a description of the exchange reported by the New York Times, Capt. Yared Getachew sounded panicked as he requested permission to return to the airport, shortly before losing contact. Even amid the worldwide grounding of more than 370 of its 737 Max jets, officials at Boeing continued to maintain the planes are safe to fly. The Chicago-based aviation giant has stopped delivery of the planes, a spokesman said Thursday, but their production continues. In the case of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, faulty information from the angle-of-attack sensor convinced the automated system that the plane was going to stall and pushed its nose down while the pilots wrestled to pull the aircraft up. The result was an erratic flight path in which the plane descended and ascended repeatedly before plunging into the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew aboard. The data from the recorders in Ethi­o­pia could help determine whether the potential links between the two crashes are real and related to this automated feature on the craft — hundreds of which were flown around the world until China decided to ground them Monday and other countries followed suit. The recorders are required on all flights — all over the world — and are built to withstand fire, heavy impact and intense water pressure. The Ethio­pian Airlines devices were discovered soon after the crash, leading some U.S. officials to hope the insights they contain will quickly help determine more about what caused the jet to crash shortly after it left Addis Ababa bound for Nairobi. While Ethio­pian investigators have the ability to download information from black boxes, they lacked the tools to do so in this case, given the extensive damage, according to the FAA. Experts were not surprised the Ethiopians opted to send the flight recorders to France rather than the United States, saying such a move was not unprecedented. “Many times foreign countries just have a good relation with a certain other country,” said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB investigator and FAA safety manager. “It is closer to fly the recorders to Europe than it is to the United States. From a technical standpoint, the United States would have been the best place to have it because all your technical experts are in the United States. But in past investigations, foreign countries would not opt to send to the U.S., because they were the ones who built the airplane” paul.schemm@washpost.com luz.lazo@washpost.com lori.aratani@washpost.com	592	"[{""start"": 13, ""end"": 268, ""text"": ""thi­o­pia — A new piece of evidence found by investigators on the ground here suggests the Ethi­o­pian Airlines flight that crashed Sunday may have had a problem with a new flight-control system also suspected in the crash of a Lion Air flight in October"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 270, ""end"": 387, ""text"": ""It is the second piece of information suggesting similarities between the two crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 730, ""end"": 1068, ""text"": ""Cox, formerly the top safety official for the Air Line Pilots Association, said he was privately briefed on the evidence Thursday by people familiar with the investigation. “All we can say definitely is that the trim was in a position similar to the position found on the Lion Air airplane and it would cause the nose to go down,” he said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1489, ""end"": 1713, ""text"": ""Daniel K.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — U.S. officials expressed confidence Monday in the Boeing-made jetliner involved in Sunday’s Ethi­o­pia Airlines crash that killed all 157 people aboard and said they saw no reason so far to restrict the planes from flying. Airlines and regulators in Ethi­o­pia, China and other countries, meanwhile, said they were temporarily grounding Boeing’s newest version of the 737, the Max 8, after the plane was involved in its second fatal crash in less than five months. Monday evening, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a “continued airworthiness notification to the international community for Boeing 737 Max operators.” The notification essentially said that U.S. regulators think the aircraft are safe to operate but that the agency will take additional action if it receives information indicating otherwise. It also outlined previous actions the FAA had taken related to the crash of a Lion Air flight Oct. 29. That plane also was a Max 8. “The FAA continuously assesses and oversees the safety performance of . . . U.S. commercial aircraft,” Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said. “If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.” European regulators, too, are continuing to monitor the investigation before taking action. “The European Aviation Safety Agency will assess the risk and decide based on information received if there is any further action,” European Commission spokesman Enrico Brivio said. The Ethiopian government declared a national day of mourning Monday as the recovery efforts continued. Ethio­pian Airlines said the plane’s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered. The hope is that the instruments will offer critical details about what happened in the minutes before the Nairobi-bound flight crashed. “At this stage, we cannot rule out anything,” Tewolde GebreMariam, chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, told reporters at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, the BBC reported. The investigative team includes representatives from the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Those aboard the flight represented more than 30 nationalities, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians and eight Americans. Several of the victims were traveling to a United Nations environmental conference. “The environmental community is in mourning today,” the U.N. Environment Program said in a statement, describing the loss of “seasoned scientists, members of academia and other partners.” The organization’s global headquarters is in Nairobi. The crash drew immediate comparisons to the October crash of Lion Air Flight 610. All 189 passengers and crew aboard were killed when that jet crashed into the Java Sea. Like the Ethio­pian flight, the Lion Air plane went down shortly after takeoff. Lion Air is a privately run Indonesian carrier. But FAA officials cautioned against drawing conclusions so early in the investigative process. “External reports are drawing similarities between this accident and the Lion Air Flight 610 accident on October 29, 2018,” the agency stated in the airworthiness notification it issued Monday. “However, this investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions.” The notice detailed training and technical changes made after the Lion Air crash. It noted that Boeing had completed improvements in the planes’ flight control system to rely less on “required pilot memory items.” The FAA said it “anticipates mandating these design changes by [airworthiness directive] no later than April 2019.” Late Monday, Boeing said in a statement that it would implement a software update to the 737 Max 8 in the coming weeks designed to “make an already safe aircraft even safer,” by making changes to “flight control law, pilot displays, operation manuals and crew training.” The update was among the design changes referenced in the FAA notice. The Air Line Pilots Association International agreed that more information was needed. “As the various parties responsible for this investigation begin their work, we caution against speculation about what may have caused this tragic accident,” the organization said in a statement. “ALPA stands ready, through the International Federation of airline Pilots’ Associations, to assist the international aviation community in every way possible with the shared goal of advancing a safer air transportation system around the globe.” Officials at Chicago-based Boeing said the company had no reason to recommend that the planes be grounded. “The investigation is in its early stages, but at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators,” a company spokesman said via email. But a U.S. travelers’ rights group called on the FAA to immediately pull the Max 8 from service. “The FAA’s wait and see attitude risks lives as well as the safety reputation of the U.S. aviation industry,” said Paul Hudson, president of FlyersRights.org, a consumer advocacy group. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) wrote to acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell asking that the aircraft be grounded “until their safe use has been confirmed.” Feinstein is the first U.S. politician to make such a request. “Until the cause of the crash is known and it’s clear that similar risks aren’t present in the domestic fleet, I believe the Boeing 737 Max 8 series aircraft operating in the United States should be temporarily grounded,” the senator said in her letter. Boeing stock plunged Monday morning, dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. Chao said she met with a top FAA official “to review what has happened on this crash, what has happened with the previous accident, and what are possible paths going forward.” The secretary added that people should “be assured that we take these accidents very seriously, we are reviewing them very carefully,” and said she has asked to be directly briefed on the latest developments and findings. In 2013, several fire incidents led the FAA to ground Boeing 787 Dreamliners because of faulty lithium-ion batteries. Some countries and carriers moved to ground their Max 8 jets Monday. Ethi­o­pian Airlines said its fleet of the planes would be grounded as an “extra safety precaution.” China’s Civil Aviation Administration said in a statement early Monday that it had asked domestic airlines to temporarily ground all Max 8 jets before 6 p.m. It was the first time China has taken the lead in ordering a model grounded. Cayman Airways and Indonesia’s airlines also suspended the use of the Max 8. Indonesia’s director general of civil aviation, Polana B. Pramesti, said that the move was to ensure flight safety and that the planes would be inspected. Indonesia has 11 Max 8 aircraft in service. After a review, India’s aviation authority said that crew members operating the Max 8 must undergo specific training and that only pilots with 1,000 hours of flying experience would be allowed to operate the aircraft. There are 17 Max 8 aircraft operating in the country. In Vietnam, meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority said it would not license the use of the Max plane in the country pending the results of investigations and remedial measures. While there are no Max 8 aircraft in use in Vietnam, budget airline VietJet Air ordered 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in February, including 20 of the Max 8 version. The order was made at the same time President Trump was meeting with Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi. The national airlines of Mexico and Argentina announced Monday night that they had suspended the operation of their Max 8 planes, Reuters reported. Singapore, Morocco and Mongolia also suspended operation of Max 8 planes, news agencies reported. Royal Air Maroc had two of the airliners in service and two on order. Mongolia reportedly had one of the planes in service. In the United States, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines expressed confidence in their Boeing planes. “Our fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft are operating as planned today and we plan to operate those aircraft going forward,” Southwest said in a statement. American said it has “full confidence in the aircraft and our crew members.” United and Delta do not have Max 8 aircraft in their fleets. United does have Max 9s, another version of the Boeing series. It was the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash that first raised concerns about the Max 8. According to the investigation into that crash, pilots wrestled with the plane because a faulty sensor and automatic feature sent its nose pointing down while the pilots struggled to lift the plane up. They requested permission to return to the airport shortly before plunging into the Java Sea. Officials said Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302 crashed just six minutes after takeoff. During the brief flight, data showed the plane ascending, then descending, then ascending sharply again while accelerating to speeds in excess of what is standard during a takeoff. The pilot asked to return to Addis Ababa because he was experiencing difficulties. The Chinese Civil Aviation Administration, in issuing its order to ground the jets, cited similarities between the two crashes. The CCAA said that all planes of that model would be grounded until further notice under Chinese policies allowing “zero tolerance for safety hazards” and risks. Officials added that they would consult with the FAA and Boeing. A spokeswoman for Boeing China said the company was staying in touch with all of its customers and government regulators and working closely with the investigative team in Ethiopia to understand the cause of the crash. The pilot has been identified as Yared Getachew, 29, of Addis Ababa. According to a statement issued by relatives in Northern Virginia, Getachew had 8,000 hours of flight time and was the youngest pilot in Ethio­pian Airlines history to captain a Boeing 737. Though young, he was described by the company as a senior pilot. Ethio­pian Airlines is Africa’s largest airline in terms of destinations and passengers served. It has ambitions of serving as the gateway to Africa and is widely viewed as one of the best-managed airlines on the continent. It serves more than 100 destinations, including Washington, New York and Chicago. The airline’s last major crash was in 2010, when an aircraft caught fire and plunged into the Mediterranean after taking off from Beirut’s airport, killing all 90 people on board. Bad weather and a technical fault were cited. paul.schemm@washpost.com lori.aratani@washpost.com michael.laris@washpost.com	591	"[{""start"": 249, ""end"": 490, ""text"": ""Airlines and regulators in Ethi­o­pia, China and other countries, meanwhile, said they were temporarily grounding Boeing’s newest version of the 737, the Max 8, after the plane was involved in its second fatal crash in less than five months."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 843, ""end"": 974, ""text"": ""It also outlined previous actions the FAA had taken related to the crash of a Lion Air flight Oct. 29.

This story has been updated. Before Sunday’s Ethiopian Airlines crash, most travelers did not give much thought to the type of aircraft they were flying to their destination. All that mattered was the departure time, seat assignment and fare. That’s no longer the case. And if it’s a Boeing 737 Max 8, they might wonder: How can I get off that aircraft and onto one with a more comforting safety record? “Ninety-nine percent of the flying public doesn’t pay attention to the kind of aircraft,” said Madhu Unnikrishnan, editor of Skift Airline Weekly, an industry publication. “Only a subset of people are interested.” The interest has grown significantly since the second of two crashes involving the 737 Max 8. In October, a Lion Air flight crashed after takeoff in Jakarta, Indonesia. Five months later, the Ethi­o­pian Airlines disaster occurred. The aircraft, which has been in service for less than two years, has completed a quarter-million trips according to Seth Kaplan, an aviation expert who analyzed information from data provider Diio Mi. But it took only two accidents to rattle the world. In response to the crashes, a growing number of countries have received directives from their aviation regulatory agencies to ground the fleets of Boeing 737 Max 8s. The list includes the European Union, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Oman, India, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Malaysia and Canada, the most recent government to announce its decision. Individual airlines have also suspended its use, such as Cayman Airways, Royal Air Maroc and Icelandair. The United States has not issued grounding orders, and American Airlines and Southwest continue to board and book passengers on their 737 Max 8s. “The FAA will issue a Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) for Boeing 737 MAX operators,” the FAA wrote in a statement. “The FAA continuously assesses and oversees the safety performance of U.S. commercial aircraft. If we identify an issue that affects safety, the FAA will take immediate and appropriate action.” Unless the situation changes in the United States, the decision to travel on a Boeing 737 Max 8 rests in the hands of the passenger. Before you book a flight online, check the aircraft type scheduled for your desired route. The grid of results usually displays the model along with the departure time, flight number, layover city and other details. For example, passengers on a Southwest flight from Washington Dulles to Las Vegas via Denver fly on a Boeing 737 Max 8 for both legs. However, a later flight through Atlanta uses a Boeing 737-800. Unnikrishnan said the airlines also share this information on their apps. Even if you have booked yourself on a different aircraft, the airline could swap out planes last minute because of a mechanical or weather-related issue. To learn about a possible aircraft change, call the carrier before your departure. Then double-check at the airport. Ask an airline employee at the check-in counter or gate. Unnikrishnan said many carriers also post the aircraft type on the airport flight monitors. If you suddenly find yourself on a 737 Max 8 — or maybe you just discovered that a future flight is on one — reach out to the airline by phone or social media. (For the latter scenario, don’t forget that you can cancel or change your reservation without penalty within 24 hours of booking.) Carriers are handling requests to switch aircraft differently. Southwest, for one, will waive the difference in fares. “We are working with customers individually who wish to rebook their flight to another aircraft type,” Southwest said in a statement. “While we don’t charge change fees as it is, we will be waiving any potential fare differences there might be in this particular situation.” American Airlines has not altered its policy — change fee plus difference in fare — but is reassuring travelers of the safety of its aircraft. “At American, we have not had similar issues regarding an erroneous Angle of Attack during manual flight,” the airline noted in a statement. Tracy Stewart, content editor at Airfarewatchdog.com, says that airline employees may be flexible, especially considering the sensitive circumstances. “Even if it’s not the official policy,” he said, “they might work with you to change flights.” Your travel insurance policy could cover your new plans if you opted for the Cancel for Any Reason upgrade. With this benefit, travelers receive up to 75 percent of their trip costs. However, the policy is restrictive: You must have purchased it within 21 days of your initial trip payment and must cancel at least two to three days before your departure, according to Jenna Hummer, a spokeswoman with Squaremouth, which compares travel insurance plans. “There is no to very limited travel insurance coverage for wanting to change carriers due to the recent Boeing Max 8 crash,” she said. “Standard travel insurance policies typically don’t provide cancellation coverage for situations such as this, including travel warnings and other national or international government-issued advisories.” As a last resort, Kaplan reminds travelers about the “flat tire rule.” If you narrowly miss a flight, the airline will typically place you on the next available flight free of charge. Proof of the extenuating circumstances is not required. andrea.sachs@washpost.com More from Travel: How I regularly book round-trip international flights for less than $400 Could you endure the world’s longest nonstop flight?

A SECOND fatal airplane accident involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 may have been a case of man vs. machine. The fact that the machine was designed to protect passengers points to a need for rethinking safeguards in an age of increasing automation. Investigators are probing whether the Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people in a crash this month and the Lion Air flight that killed 189 people in Indonesia last fall were caused by the same malfunctioning software. The Federal Aviation Administration is known for its stringent safety rules, but the problem Boeing says it is now patching — an anti-stall system that officials suspect kicked into effect in Indonesia based on bad data — snuck through anyway. The debacle shows that regulators should apply extra review to systems that take control away from humans when safety is at stake: Some blame the mess-up on the FAA’s decision to outsource some components of performance reviews to the manufacturer. The anti-stall software apparently forced down a plane’s nose based on data from only a single sensor, which meant one erroneous reading could cause failure. That’s an unusual practice in air safety, and one a thorough process might have prevented. But perfecting such a process is more difficult than it sounds. Government already suffers from a dearth of qualified computer scientists, and the more advanced technology becomes, the more difficult it is to evaluate. Partnerships with engineering experts, perhaps through universities, could help, but even the designers of artificially intelligent systems sometimes cannot explain why they make the decisions they do. These realities demand that regulators tread carefully when approving automated technologies whose bugs could kill. They also demand that humans remain as informed as possible about the systems on which they are relying. Professionals should be adequately trained, but software should also be transparent. The 737 Max anti-stall system reset itself every time pilots course-corrected while their planes plunged toward the ground. To fully disable it, pilots would have had to throw two additional switches — but to know to do that, they would also have had to know what was wrong. Boeing charged a premium for a “disagree” light on the plane to inform pilots that its sensors were giving contradictory readings. Airlines also had to pay extra for a feature with a complete reading for each sensor. The company is now changing that practice. The 737 crisis has implications for more industries than just aviation, from self-driving cars to medical care. Software has bugs. Extensive testing can preempt some problems, but it is almost impossible to root out all eventualities. Where the consequences of a machine’s failure are the most severe, humans cannot afford to stop paying attention.	589	"[{""start"": 2, ""end"": 61, ""text"": ""D fatal airplane accident involving a Boeing 737 Max 8"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 243, ""end"": 469, ""text"": ""nvestigators are probing whether the Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people in a crash this month and the Lion Air flight that killed 189 people in Indonesia last fall were caused by the same malfunctioning softwar"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1940, ""end"": 2214, ""text"": ""The 737 Max anti-stall system reset itself every time pilots course-corrected while their planes plunged toward the ground.

Boeing’s 737 Max jet found a sweet spot for the company’s growing base of customers around the world: It’s a best-selling workhorse with low costs, minimal upkeep and an ability to cram in more passengers. The airplane would prove perfect for midrange flights that could maximize profits for carriers. As it boosted production, Boeing boasted that pilots did not even need flight simulator training to fly the new Max 8 jets. That helped the Chicago-based aerospace giant sell thousands of them, deepening relationships with China and fast-growing markets such as Indonesia and Ethiopia. Ultimately it powered a stock market rise that added billions to the company’s value. “We aspire to be an enduring global industrial champion,” CEO Dennis Muilenburg told shareholders in a 2017 address commemorating the company’s 100th anniversary, “a top performer in every aspect of our business, delivering superior value to our customers, employees, shareholders, communities and partners.” But the crash of a 737 Max 8 in Ethiopia on Sunday — the second in less than five months — threatens to undermine Boeing’s reputation around the world for safety and reliability. Already, China — the company’s most important foreign market — has grounded the 737 Max 8. Analysts said Boeing would need to get to the bottom of what caused the crash and soon, or face a backlash from potential customers and investors. Within hours of China’s decision, smaller airlines followed suit. And regulators in Ethiopia and Indonesia called for closer inspections of the plane. On Tuesday, Britain joined the list of countries that have barred 737 Max planes from their airspace. The British Civil Aviation Authority announced that “as a precautionary measure,” no “commercial passenger flights from any operator” will be allowed to arrive, depart or overfly British airspace until further notice. It noted that five 737 Max aircraft currently operate in the United Kingdom and a sixth had been scheduled to enter service later this week. It is not clear why Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 fell from the skies six minutes after takeoff Sunday on its way to Nairobi. The investigation has just begun. But the crash, which killed all 157 people on board, puts the spotlight on Boeing, which already faced scrutiny for the October crash of a 737 Max 8 in Indonesia and concerns that a software update to the 737 could make it hard for pilots to override a malfunctioning autopilot system when it steers the plane into a nose-dive. In a statement Monday, Boeing said no new safety guidance is planned as of now: “The investigation is in its early stages, but at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance.” The Federal Aviation Administration endorsed the Max 8 on Monday, issuing an “airworthiness notification” but saying that it would “continuously assess” the plane’s safety performance. Boeing said in a statement late Monday evening that it would implement a software update to the 737 Max 8 in the coming weeks designed to “make an already safe aircraft even safer,” with changes to “flight control law, pilot displays, operation manuals and crew training.” The statement came after the FAA said it would mandate “design changes” no later than April. While investigators descended on the crash site trying to determine what happened, China, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore and Ethiopia grounded the planes. Australia — a major long-distance travel destination — barred them from its airspace, and Britain announced a similar ban on Tuesday. Investors battered Boeing’s stock, which fell more than 12 percent in early trading Monday before rebounding and finishing the day down 5.4 percent, a sign of investor confidence in the stalwart company. But analysts at Jefferies investment bank estimated that the worst-case scenario — a software problem causing a full grounding and halt to deliveries of the 737 Max 8 — could cost Boeing about $5.1 billion, or 5 percent of the company’s annual revenue, within two months. The 737 program is expected to generate about $32 billion for Boeing in 2019, Jefferies estimated, making it one of the company’s single-largest sources of business. “This is clearly a fluid situation and one that may have serious repercussions for Boeing over the short and long terms,” Value Line, an investment research firm, wrote in a note for its clients. “For now, we are leaving our financial estimates unchanged, but there is clearly a large cloud of uncertainty here.” For Boeing, the largest U.S. manufacturing exporter, there is no foreign market more crucial than China. The 737 is a key part in Boeing’s plans there and beyond. In 2018, Boeing increased 737 production to 52 planes a month. And nearly half of the 580 units it delivered last year were from the Max family version of the plane. Of the 43,000 new aircraft it plans to sell in the next 20 years, Boeing expects that Chinese airlines will buy nearly 20 percent. To cement what executives hope will be a fruitful relationship for years to come, Boeing recently built a plant where it finishes its planes there. And in a recent speech Muilenburg reportedly stressed how key China is to its bottom line, saying that while the company “is doing well there,” it remains “important that we have a productive relationship.” In an earnings call earlier this year, he said the company views “China as a long-term growth market for us.” And he said that the country “needs the airplanes for growth to fuel their economy and to meet their passenger growth and cargo growth needs.” The decision to ground the planes was an extraordinary one, especially in China, where it created headaches for travelers, disrupted the economy and caused at least a temporary rupture in relations with the American aerospace behemoth. “China is going to be ticked by having to ground those airplanes,” said Mike Boyd, president of Mike Boyd International, an aviation consulting firm. “That will hurt the Chinese economy. China isn’t exactly rushing off to Wall Street to buy Boeing stock, but they are going to have to do business with Boeing.” Boeing has nearly 3,000 orders for the Max 8 version of the plane, according to Boyd’s analysis, with China expected to be a significant purchaser. But now “they could lose some of that business,” Boyd said. “Everybody has a lot on the line. Boeing needs China. China needs Boeing, too.” And it comes in a tumultuous global trade environment, as the Trump administration and Chinese officials go round and round on a long-term trade agreement. “All of this comes at a delicate time for Boeing because of everything else that’s going on,” said Kevin Michaels, an aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisory, a Michigan-based consultancy. “There were no new orders of 737 last year [in China], and it’s possible that was because of trade issues.” In October, an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew members. Investigators blamed a faulty sensor and automatic feature for pointing its nose down while pilots struggled to lift the plane up. Criticism against Boeing stirred when the company disclosed after the Lion Air disaster that a new autopilot program known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, could disable a feature that pilots would use to take control of a plane. The updated software was meant to make the plane safer, by accounting for minor design changes to its engines. But pilots said a Boeing decision not to include the new system in pilot training left them “in the dark” about how to respond in an emergency. Pilots of the Lion Air 737 battled the computerized control system in an effort to arrest the plane’s dive, but each time the system reasserted itself, and the plane hit the water at 450 miles an hour, according to Indonesia’s initial investigation report. The company faces lawsuits from at least two dozen family members whose loved ones died in the crash. While Boeing issued a bulletin in November after the crash, the controversy revived an ongoing debate about what degree of automation is safest for airplanes — and how much control human pilots should maintain. Though the Ethiopia investigation is still in the early stages, the similarities between the two crashes have prompted carriers around the world to take added precautions. In December, Muilenburg told CNBC that the “airplane is safe. We’re very confident in that.” He touted the aircraft, which he said was designed so that additional training would be kept to a minimum on it. “What we wanted to accomplish was seamless training and introduction for our customers,” he said. “We purposefully designed the airplane to behave in the same way” as previous models. The crash comes as Boeing’s commercial business has been surging, even after the October crash. And with a backlog of 5,900 airplane orders, or about seven years of production, that is valued at $412 billion, Boeing predicted continued growth in 2019. One of Muilenburg’s goals for the company has been to better integrate its major business units — commercial jets, defense, space and services — under a strategy he has called “One Boeing.” Boeing’s defense business has had a good run recently as well. It recently won three major military contracts, totaling more than $18 billion combined to build training jets, replacement helicopters and drones that can refuel fighter jets in midair. It is also building the next Air Force One, a spacecraft to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and a monster rocket that NASA says will one day take them to the moon. In 2016, Boeing celebrated its 100th anniversary, a legacy that marches in lockstep with the history of American aviation, from the dawn of commercial air travel in the years following the Wright Brothers to the bombers that helped to allies win World War II, to the F-18 Hornets and 747s in use today. The Chicago-based aerospace giant has more than $100 billion in revenue and 153,000 employees worldwide. But now that investigators are probing two crashes that have killed a total of 346 people, the company is facing a crisis involving its core business and a threat to the reputation it has built up after decades. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was “closely monitoring developments” and that it planned to join the National Transportation Safety Board, which was working with Ethiopian authorities investigating the crash. But it did not ground the planes, which are flown by American and Southwest airlines. The 737 Max 8 has been an important profit driver for Boeing since it was introduced in 2017. It is crucial to Boeing’s broader international ambitions as it competes with Airbus, its European rival in the commercial airline business. Boeing has delivered 354 of the jets globally and has 2,912 on order, according to market estimates maintained by Boyd Group International. The jet that crashed Sunday was one of five 737 Max 8 planes operated by Ethiopian Airlines, which has 25 more on order. In the United States, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have 59 between their two fleets, with 304 on order. American Airlines said it was monitoring the investigation but remained confident in the safety of its aircraft. Southwest said it has been in touch with Boeing and plans to follow the investigation. It had not made any changes to its operations or inspection protocol as of Sunday, the airline said. Customers took to Twitter to press for information, including one who said: “It was the first time i have ever been nervous flying with you in 25 years and hundreds of flights.” Thomas Heath contributed to this report.	588	"[{""start"": 980, ""end"": 1071, ""text"": ""” But the crash of a 737 Max 8 in Ethiopia on Sunday — the second in less than five months"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1162, ""end"": 1251, ""text"": ""Already, China — the company’s most important foreign market — has grounded the 737 Max 8"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2172, ""end"": 2498, ""text"": ""But the crash, which killed all 157 people on board, puts the spotlight on Boeing, which already faced scrutiny for the October crash of a 737 Max 8 in Indonesia and concerns that a software update to the 737 could make it hard for pilots to override a malfunctioning autopilot system when it steers the plane into a nose-dive"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3278, ""end"": 3564, ""text"": ""While investigators descended on the crash site trying to determine what happened, China, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore and Ethiopia grounded the planes.

No plane. No game. It has been 12 days since the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Boeing 737 MAX 8, and airlines are warning of more flight cancellations to come. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are offering customers a cushion for how long they can cancel or rebook their flights. And though it’s still unclear how long the FAA order will last, other carriers are planning long term: Air Canada told its passengers to brace for cancellations heading into July. American Airlines, which has 24 MAX planes in its fleet, said Sunday it would extend cancellations through April 24. The carrier said it expects to cancel roughly 90 flights per day based on its April schedule, and that it was waiting on the FAA, the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board, along with Boeing, before reintroducing the grounded planes. The flight disruptions are the latest ripple effects of a mounting crisis of confidence for Boeing. Those concerns started when a brand-new Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed in Indonesia in late October, killing 189 people. Weeks later, Boeing disclosed the existence of a new flight control system called MCAS, which can push the plane’s nose downward in certain circumstances. Pilot groups in the U.S. were incensed that Boeing had built the system into its new jets without detailing it in training courses, raising concerns that pilots might not know how to take control at a crucial moment. Those criticisms reached a fever pitch earlier this month when another Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed in Ethiopia under similar circumstances. Regulators in China, Europe, Indonesia and Ethiopia quickly grounded the planes; the FAA held off for several days before idling all 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes in the U.S. Investigators have yet to directly assign blame for either crash. The FAA’s relative slowness in grounding the 737 MAX, along with reports of a criminal investigation into how the new plane was certified, has shaken international confidence in the agency. Numerous international regulators committed to conducting their own regulatory reviews of Boeing’s MCAS fix rather than trust the FAA’s analysis. This could extend the financial pain for Boeing, Cowen investment analyst Cai Von Rumohr said in a note Monday to investors, because about 40 percent of Boeing’s 737 MAX backlog comes from China, Canada and Europe. “Because both the FAA and Boeing were slow to call for grounding the MAX, they’ve both suffered a loss of reputational credibility,” the note said. For wary American Airlines passengers, that doesn’t mean that every flight originally scheduled on a MAX aircraft will be dropped. The company is swapping other types of planes for canceled MAX flights. Still, a flight that wasn’t originally scheduled on a MAX plane might be canceled to cover for the rest of the fleet. Affected customers should be contacted by the airline’s reservations team, or a travel agent. Customers also can request refunds if they don’t want to rebook. Southwest Airlines said Monday that it’s handling an average of 130 cancellations a day, out of more than 4,000 flights throughout its system. The airline has idled 34 MAX aircraft and is making cancellations five days out. Last week, the airline said that any customer booked on a canceled MAX flight could rebook without any additional fees or fare differences within 14 days of the original travel date. Boeing, meanwhile, is working with pilots and regulators on its software and training updates for its 737 MAX. Two hundred pilots and regulators are expected to join a training session on Wednesday at its Renton, Washington, plant. Boeing executives also met with pilots and trainers on Saturday. On March 13, the FAA grounded all 737 MAX jets in the U.S. Agency officials said that airplane tracking data and new evidence from the wreckage of the Ethiopia crash showed similarities to the crash in Indonesia, leading the agency to ground both the 737 Max 8 and the Max 9, another aircraft in the series. As recently as that morning, Boeing and the FAA maintained that the MAX planes were safe to fly. There’s some question of how long the FAA will continue to ground planes in the United States. Boeing announced on March 12 ― just after the Ethiopian Airlines crash ― that it would carry out a new “software enhancement” designed to “make a safe aircraft even safer,” and would also set up new crew training related to the MCAS system. The software fix had been in the works for months. The FAA expects the software fix to be ready some time this week, an agency spokesman said Saturday, after which point the FAA would evaluate it. The new software is to include new indicators of the plane’s “angle of attack,” a measure of the direction of the plane’s nose. It also is to include a new warning system so pilots know when the automated MCAS system has been activated, and limits on how far down the system can point the plane. Separately, Boeing is rolling out new pilot training courses to cover the new flight control systems. The training and software fixes are part of a full-court press by Boeing to restore confidence in its 737 MAX 8 jets. The company’s stock has fallen roughly 8 percent since the second crash. To return to business as usual, Boeing will have to satisfy not only the FAA but also global regulators, skeptical airlines in the U.S. and elsewhere, and the flying public. It could be months before some airlines will fly the 737 MAX 8: Air Canada announced last week it would remove all 24 MAX aircraft from its flight schedules through at least July 1. “Given the magnitude of our 737 MAX operations which on average carry nine to twelve thousand customers per day, customers can expect delays in rebooking,” the airline said.	587	"[{""start"": 3, ""end"": 173, ""text"": ""ane.

In 2014, Lufthansa Flight 1829 took off from Bilbao, Spain, and was ascending normally when the plane’s nose unexpectedly dropped. The plane — an Airbus A321 with 109 passengers on board — began to fall. The co-pilot tried to raise the nose with his controls. The plane pointed down even further. He tried again. Nothing, according to a report by German investigators. As the Lufthansa plane fell from 31,000 feet, the captain pulled back on his stick as hard as he could. The nose finally responded. But he struggled to hold the plane level. A call to a ground crew determined the plane’s angle-of-attack sensors — which detect whether the wings have enough lift to keep flying — must have been malfunctioning, causing the Airbus’s anti-stall software to force the plane’s nose down. The pilots turned off the problematic unit and continued the flight. Aviation authorities in Europe and the United States eventually ordered the replacement of angle-of-attack sensors on many Airbus models. Today, aviation experts say that the angle-of-attack sensor on Boeing jets will get fresh scrutiny after two Boeing 737 Max airplanes crashed, in Ethiopia last week and in Indonesia in October. Accident investigators have raised concerns about the role of the sensor — a device used on virtually every commercial flight — in the October crash of Lion Air Flight 610. There are concerns it may have sent the wrong signals to new software on the flight that automatically dips the plane’s nose to prevent a stall. It is not clear whether the angle-of-attack sensor played a role in the crash of Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said Sunday that his company is finalizing software updates and pilot training protocols to address problems that have emerged “in response to erroneous sensor inputs.” He did not specify which sensors. Muilenberg’s comments followed a statement by Ethiopia’s transportation secretary earlier Sunday that the plane’s black boxes showed “clear similarities” between the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes. Aviation authorities worldwide grounded the Boeing 737 Max last week out of concern about the plane’s safety. In interviews late last week, aviation experts said there was no reason for broad alarm about the sensors. But six experts said that the risks posed by a faulty angle-of-attack sensor are amplified by the increasing role of cockpit automation. It is an example of how the same technology that makes aircraft safer — automated software — can be undone by a seemingly small problem. “The sensor going out is serious,” said Clint Balog, a test pilot and associate professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “But it can be made critical by software.” Most commercial pilots today know how to respond to a malfunctioning sensor, said Shem Malmquist, a Boeing 777 captain and a visiting professor at the Florida Institute of Technology. But potential complications arise with how software interprets what the sensor tells it. “When you introduce computer controls, you start to get interactions that are hard to anticipate,” Malmquist said. Angle-of-attack sensors have been flagged as problems more than 50 times on U.S. commercial airplanes over the past five years, although no accidents have occurred over millions of miles flown, according to reports made to the Federal Aviation Administration’s Service Difficulty Reporting database. That makes it a relatively unusual problem, aviation experts said — but also one with magnified importance because of its prominent role in flight software. “It is notable,” said David Soucie, a former FAA maintenance safety inspector. The sensor is especially helpful for nighttime flying, Soucie said, but its loss alone should not create problems that pilots are unable to handle. The FAA reports include 19 reported cases of sensor trouble on Boeing aircraft, such as an American Airlines flight last year that declared a midflight emergency when the plane’s stall-warning system went off, despite normal airspeed. The Boeing 737-800 landed safely. Maintenance crews replaced three parts, including the angle-of-attack sensor, according to the FAA database. In 2017, an American Airlines-operated Boeing 767 headed to Zurich declared an emergency and returned to New York. Another angle-of-attack sensor was replaced. And an American Airlines 767 was forced to return to Miami in 2014 after a midflight emergency because of a faulty angle-of-attack sensor. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment for this report. The FAA did not respond to a request for comment. The angle-of-attack sensors on the fatal Lion Air flight were made by Minnesota-based Rosemount Aerospace, according to a photograph of the part that was shown by Indonesian officials to reporters after the recovery of the wreckage. It is a model commonly used on commercial aircraft. A spokeswoman for Rosemount’s parent company, United Technologies, declined to comment. The angle-of-attack sensor measures the amount of lift generated by the wings. The name refers to the angle between the wing and oncoming air. Its main purpose is to warn pilots when the plane could stall from too little lift, leading to a loss of control. Many of the sensors include a small vane attached to the outside of a commercial aircraft. Most planes have two or three vanes as part of a redundant system. But they are not complicated machines. The Wright brothers used a version on their first flight. Placing too much trust in the sensors also can cause trouble. One of the most serious accidents tied to angle-of-attack sensors occurred in 2008, when XL Airways Germany Flight 888T crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, killing seven people. French authorities blamed water-soaked angle-of-attack sensors on the Airbus 320 plane, saying they generated inaccurate readings and set up a chain of events that resulted in a stall. According to investigators, the downed airplane’s sensors were made by Rosemount, the same company that made the sensors on the Lion Air crash. At the time, Rosemount was also called Goodrich, the company that owned the aerospace manufacturer at the time. In the Lion Air crash, pilots struggled for control with the 737 Max’s automated flight controls — the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. Faulty readings from the angle-of-attack sensors may have led the MCAS to believe the aircraft was in danger of stalling just as it was taking off from Indonesia, according to the preliminary report by Indonesian investigators. Gaining speed by diving can prevent a stall. After the crash, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive in November for 737 Max 8 and 9 models that warned a mistakenly high reading from one angle-of-attack sensor “could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane.” Less is known about the Ethiopian Airlines crash. But it involves the same type of aircraft and crashed at a similar point in its flight path as the Lion Air plane, according to investigators. Both planes were equipped with the MCAS, which uses angle-of-attack sensors to determine whether a plane is nearing a stall. Airbus equips many of its commercial jets with its own anti-stall software that relies on an automated process. During the Lufthansa flight in 2014, faulty information from the angle-of-attack sensors triggered the software, pushing the plane’s nose down, according to German aviation investigators. The program thought the plane was nearing a stall. The captain was eventually able to override the automated system, and the pilots, after talking with a maintenance crew, identified the likely problem and continued the flight to Munich. Investigators later found that two of the angle-of-attack sensors were blocked, probably by frozen water, and generated improper readings. European authorities and the FAA issued airworthiness directives over several years aimed at addressing sensor problems on Airbuses. Airbus A320 planes with certain sensors made by two companies — United Technologies, parent company of Rosemount, which makes Boeing sensors; and Sextant/Thomson — “appear to have a greater susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions” than sensors made by a third company, the FAA said. One important difference between the Lufthansa incident and the two 737 Max accidents, aviation experts said, was where they occurred. The Lufthansa plane was soaring at 31,000 feet when it launched into a steep dive. It dropped 4,000 feet in less than a minute before the pilots wrestled back control. If the sensor problem had hit soon after departure, as investigators suspect it did with the Lion Air crash, that incident could have ended in disaster. todd.frankel@washpost.com	586	"[{""start"": 992, ""end"": 1357, ""text"": ""Today, aviation experts say that the angle-of-attack sensor on Boeing jets will get fresh scrutiny after two Boeing 737 Max airplanes crashed, in Ethiopia last week and in Indonesia in October.

BEIJING — When China on Monday became the first country to order all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes grounded in the aftermath of an Ethiopian Airlines crash Sunday, its aviation regulator sent an unmistakable signal: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is no longer the only authority in civil aviation worldwide. After China ordered a dozen carriers to ground their 96 planes — about a quarter of all 737 Max aircraft in operation globally — authorities in Ethi­o­pia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Morocco and Singapore quickly followed suit, along with carriers in Latin America and South Korea. Despite the FAA issuing a statement backing the Boeing jet’s airworthiness, the European Union grounded the model Tuesday, as did at least 10 other countries, with authorities saying the aircraft would not be allowed to fly to or from their countries pending the investigation. China’s move, unprecedented for a government that once took cues from the FAA, was motivated by what Chinese officials and pilots said was months of equivocation from U.S. officials and Boeing in response to safety inquiries from China after a 737 Max 8 flight crashed in Indonesia in October.  The move by China and a growing number of national authorities could raise the stakes for Boeing and U.S. officials even while the crash investigation in Ethi­o­pia is in its early stages. “The differences of opinion will add to the pressure on the FAA to share their reasoning and what they’re proposing to do,” said Andrew Herdman, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. Investigations of both the Ethiopian and Indonesian crashes are ongoing; the FAA said Monday that it has a team in Ethi­o­pia at the site of the wreckage. The agency said it will mandate a software fix in the coming weeks to the jet’s automation. A top official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said Monday that the Chinese asked their counterparts at the FAA as well as Boeing about piloting software and safety issues concerning the popular new airliner model after Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the sea off Indonesia last fall, but that they have not received satisfactory answers. Aviation experts said issues with the 737 Max’s new piloting software, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), and angle-of-attack sensors may have played a role in both accidents, which occurred less than five months apart. Boeing issued notices to pilots worldwide about the MCAS after the Lion Air crash but has been criticized for not doing so sooner — or more thoroughly. “They have had difficulty making a decision, so we took the lead,” CAAC Deputy Director Li Jian told reporters in Beijing, referring to a lack of stronger FAA measures regarding the 737 Max. Li added that the plane’s software may encounter serious problems when coupled with unreliable sensor readings and suggested that this has been happening to Chinese pilots. “These kinds of situations have already happened many times,” Li said, without giving more details, according to state media. China will resume 737 Max flights after it has received sufficient safety guarantees from Boeing, he added, but there was a risk now that Chinese pilots “didn’t dare to fly, and weren’t able to fly” the plane. The FAA said Monday that it stood by the 737 Max’s airworthiness and “has not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions,” including grounding the model. Boeing China said on its Weibo social media account that a software fix would be made in several weeks. Experts widely caution that investigators have not drawn parallel links between the Ethio­pian and Lion Air crashes, and China’s move to immediately ground its entire fleet while the Ethiopian investigation was barely underway diverged from industry and regulatory norms. China’s decision may be at least partly politically influenced by its trade tensions with the United States, said Neil Hansford, an aviation consultant at Strategic Aviation Solutions in Sydney.  Li was asked about trade tensions Monday and denied that his agency was politically motivated, calling the U.S. trade dispute a “separate matter.” Hansford, who has spoken to pilot unions about their concerns flying the Boeing plane, said Chinese authorities had ample justification to move first. The FAA has shown reluctance to take tough action against a major American manufacturer, he said. “It’s not hard to be ahead of the FAA,” Hansford said. “If this had been an Airbus plane, the FAA would’ve been all over it.” Airbus is based in Europe. Chinese pilots and industry observers say Boeing sent a two-page notice to pilots worldwide about the MCAS system after the Lion Air crash. But it has not recommended widespread additional training programs or simulations, at least in China. Carl Liu, a 23-year-old pilot who has been flying 737s since June for a Chinese domestic airline, said the new model would sometimes show that the aircraft was climbing steeply, even though it was climbing by 10 degrees, and automated systems would nudge the plane’s nose down, causing a temporary loss of control. “I’ve noticed there is a great deal of error in the MCAS system, so it’s not a one-off incident,” said Liu, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition that his employer not be identified. “Boeing has not done enough; it never thought about suspending the production or operation of its 737 Max 8 planes even after recurring tragedies.” He added that “all Boeing has promised is to update the MCAS system, and even that small move came a little too late.” What Liu describes is similar to what investigators in their preliminary findings said caused the Lion Air crash, in which a malfunctioning sensor made the plane plummet repeatedly as the pilots struggled to regain control. The pilots were unable to even ascertain their speed and altitude because the system was showing erroneous readings, according to the findings. The second 737 Max 8 crash has opened up raw wounds for families and friends of those who perished in the waters off Jakarta. “I am saddened to know that [the] aviation industry was waiting for the incident to happen again to awaken themselves that Boeing is playing with lives of pilots,” said Garima Sethi, wife of Bhavye Suneja, the captain of Lion Air Flight 610. Although pilots have expressed wariness about the new jet, there is disagreement in Chinese aviation circles about whether it amounts to a design flaw. Chen Jianguo, head of technology at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of China, said all Chinese 737 Max pilots were notified about the MCAS system and its quirks after the Lion Air crash. “There’s no need for more broad training about MCAS and how to turn it off,” he said by telephone. “You just need one or two seconds to turn it off.” Herdman, of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said Boeing may be limited in what information it can convey to international authorities because of protocols governing what manufacturers may say while investigations are in progress. But authorities who have grounded the planes and those who haven’t were both acting in good faith, he said. “We’re seeing both forms of decision-making, a more deliberative, analytical, measured way and a more reactive, intuitive way,” Herdman said. “We just need to be careful the public doesn’t become unduly alarmed.” gerry.shih@washpost.com	585	"[{""start"": 312, ""end"": 587, ""text"": ""After China ordered a dozen carriers to ground their 96 planes — about a quarter of all 737 Max aircraft in operation globally — authorities in Ethi­o­pia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Morocco and Singapore quickly followed suit, along with carriers in Latin America and South Korea."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 0, ""end"": 134, ""text"": ""G — When China on Monday became the first country to order all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes grounded in the aftermath of an Ethiopia"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 588, ""end"": 864, ""text"": ""spite the FAA issuing a statement backing the Boeing jet’s airworthiness, the European Union grounded the model Tuesday, as did at least 10 other countries, with authorities saying the aircraft would not be allowed to fly to or from their countries pending the investigation"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2755, ""end"": 2926, ""text"": ""Li added that the plane’s software may encounter serious problems when coupled with unreliable sensor readings and suggested that this has been happening to Chinese pilot"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2167, ""end"": 2410, ""text"": ""Aviation experts said issues with the 737 Max’s new piloting software, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), and angle-of-attack sensors may have played a role in both accidents, which occurred less than five months apart"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4801, ""end"": 5310, ""text"": ""Carl Liu, a 23-year-old pilot who has been flying 737s since June for a Chinese domestic airline, said the new model would sometimes show that the aircraft was climbing steeply, even though it was climbing by 10 degrees, and automated systems would nudge the plane’s nose down, causing a temporary loss of control. “I’ve noticed there is a great deal of error in the MCAS system, so it’s not a one-off incident,” said Liu, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition that his employer not be identified."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5946, ""end"": 6071, ""text"": ""The second 737 Max 8 crash has opened up raw wounds for families and friends of those who perished in the waters off Jakarta."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	564	2023-04-13T09:54:49.406558Z	2023-04-13T09:54:49.406647Z	937.226
In the weeks after a Boeing jetliner crashed in the Java Sea near Indonesia last year, killing all 189 people on board, the manufacturer defended the plane’s safety features and publicly resisted calls to make changes to its system and pilot training procedures. This month, following a second deadly crash of a 737 Max, a worldwide grounding of the planes by regulators, a stock slide and the loss of a multibillion-dollar contract, Boeing is taking a new approach. The company invited hundreds of pilots and airline partners to its Renton, Wash., assembly facility Wednesday in a hastily arranged meeting to explain new safety enhancements. Boeing’s shift in tone — CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement this week the company has been “humbled” — reflects growing pressure on the company’s bottom line as its fleet of jetliners sits idle at airports. It also comes as airlines that have placed orders for hundreds of additional 737 Max jets begin to question those investments. Last week, Indonesia’s national airline, Garuda, said it canceled its order for 49 jets because of “consumers’ low confidence” in the airplanes following the crashes. The Chicago-based manufacturer is working to fulfill orders for more than 4,000 737 Max jets from dozens of airlines, according to analysts at Cowen Washington Research Group. Boeing is responding to rising public concerns about its Max planes in an effort to save the company’s image and prevent the loss of more business, said Shem Malmquist, an active Boeing 777 captain and a visiting professor at the Florida Institute of Technology. “They took a different tack — a tack they should have taken in the first place,” Malmquist said. The company’s changing response may be partly a function of how unusual the situation is, said Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan. “The way that it took off in the press and on social media is not something that Boeing is used to,” he said. “It probably took some time to put together a public strategy to deal with that.” Boeing has continued to defend the safety of its planes and deflect claims that its automation software may have contributed to either of the two crashes. At the Renton event, officials from the aerospace giant defended the embattled 737 Max as the culmination of 50 years of aircraft development in which they said safety has been the first priority. They also pushed back on the idea that something is inherently wrong with the aircraft development process within Boeing. Company officials also defended the process used to determine that the plane met government requirements. The process used to certify the plane is the subject of congressional inquiries, a Department of Transportation audit and a criminal probe by the Department of Justice. The plane maker has to walk a fine line in its public statements. Admitting that any fault lies in Boeing’s planes, including software, would create legal liability for the company and damage its reputation for safety, said Scott Hamilton, managing director at Leeham Company, an aviation consultant. “Their public statements are completely driven by what their lawyers will allow them to say,” Hamilton said. At the same time, Boeing is being pushed by regulators and customers to address the issues that may have led to two catastrophic crashes. While a preliminary report following last year’s Lion Air crash pointed to the role of the sensors, there has been no final conclusion on the cause of either crash. After that incident, Boeing initially said it did not need to make changes to the automation system suspected of playing a role in the crash. If the system malfunctions, Boeing has always given pilots an easy way to override the automation system, executives said in interviews with the media. “The appropriate flight crew response to [a system malfunction], regardless of cause, is contained in existing procedures,” a spokesman said in an email last November. The company “reinforced” those procedures in a bulletin to pilots that month, but said it wasn’t changing the procedure. It also emphasized that such action would be premature because the cause of the crash was unknown. The company submitted a proposed software fix to the Federal Aviation Administration on Jan. 21, the agency has said. A Boeing spokeswoman said the company “has been following the standard practice after any accident, supporting the investigating authorities, examining our aircraft design and operation, and taking action to enhance safety.” Safety concerns over the 737 Max intensified on March 10, when a Boeing Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff, killing 157. The FAA concluded, based on satellite data and evidence from the wreckage, that the Ethiopian incident and the earlier crash near Indonesia had enough in common that global fleets of the Max 8 should be grounded. On Wednesday, Mike Sinnett, Boeing vice president of engineering and chief project engineer, detailed a set of new flight control features in which an alert will appear at the bottom of the pilot display screen when two of the plane’s external sensors capture different measurements, something that could indicate faulty data. The briefing, before a phalanx of television cameras, occurred before the company met with more than 200 pilots, technical leaders, airline representatives and regulators ― all of whom have a stake in the 737 Max, which has been forbidden to fly passengers in the United States, Europe, China and elsewhere for almost two weeks. Boeing was working to drum up support for a flight control system overhaul and a new pilot training regimen that it hopes will allay safety concerns raised by pilot groups and others. It plans to submit the final software fixes to the FAA for review this week, something that could hasten the process of lifting the grounding order. American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines — the three U.S. carriers flying 737 Max 8 or 9 jets at the time they were grounded — all said they sent representatives to the meeting. Michael Quiello, vice president of corporate safety at United, said the airline is “optimistic” that the updates addressed the safety concerns about the 737 Max’s automation system. But, he said, “the U.S. commercial aviation system is the safest in the world because its foundation is built on rigorous data analysis and evidence-based independent oversight, and we look to the FAA to employ these tools as it reviews and certifies this software update.” Boeing is also rolling out new training for 737 Max pilots, consisting of a brief computer-based training course that walks pilots through features of the automation software, as well as additions to pilot manuals and a supplemental pilot bulletin. Though the new training is not yet finalized, two pilots familiar with Boeing’s discussions, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said the new computer-based course would only take 15 minutes. Notably, it is up to airlines to decide whether pilots should train on flight simulators specific to the 737 Max. While Boeing hosted its meetings, lawmakers in Washington staged a Senate hearing on aviation safety and oversight on Wednesday afternoon. Among those offering testimony were Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration; Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board; and Calvin L. Scovel III, the Transportation Department’s inspector general. Boeing will also have to convince a skeptical community of global aviation professionals that the 737 Max will be safe to fly once the flight systems are updated. Analysts say the financial toll on Boeing and its airline customers could grow as the crisis goes on. Boeing has suspended all future deliveries of the 737 Max 8 and 9 for as long as the grounding order is in place. “Boeing will probably owe something to the airlines,” JPM’s Seifman said. If the grounding lasts two to three months, it’s possible Boeing could face roughly $1 billion to settle legal claims by the airlines, he said. Those with future orders are waiting on a resolution. WestJet, which has two Max deliveries expected later this year, said it sent pilots to the Renton meeting Wednesday. “As the duration of the Max grounding is still unknown, if our next delivery is before the grounding is lifted, we will not take the aircraft,” WestJet spokeswoman Morgan Bell said Tuesday. “However, if the grounding has been lifted and the aircraft is approved for re-entry into service by all relevant regulatory bodies, we will take all deliveries as intended.” Boeing and the FAA have been working on the software and training fixes for months, but it is unclear why both organizations waited until after a second crash to publicly commit to them. A Boeing official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said the company has used lab and flight simulators to test how the new software would work in different scenarios, all of it in close coordination with FAA officials. Boeing flight-tested the software on a Boeing jet on Feb. 7 and again on March 12, the person said. “Test pilots flew different maneuvers and flight conditions that exercised various aspects of the software update,” the Boeing official said. The second test came two days after the Max 8 crash in Ethiopia.

"Commercial airline pilots at Southwest and American airlines were not informed during training about a new flight control system that may have played a role in the fatal crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Lion Air in Indonesia last month, pilot union representatives from both airlines said Tuesday. Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said pilots were not made aware of the issue until last week, when Boeing sent out an advisory over the issue. “We did not know this was on the [Boeing 737] MAX models,” Weaks said in a Tuesday interview, referring to a new automated flight control feature designed to prevent the plane from stalling by automatically nudging its nose downward in response to externally collected flight data. “When you’re responsible for that aircraft and there are systems on there that you have not been made aware of, that’s not right."" Dennis Tajer, communications committee chairman at Allied Pilots Association (APA), a labor union representing American Airlines pilots, said Boeing exhibited a “failure of the safety culture” by not updating pilots early enough on how the new systems work. “This was clearly a sign that the safety culture [at Boeing] was missing on a cylinder or two,” he said. “We’re all on the same side looking at Boeing, saying, ‘What else you got?’ ” In response to the concerns raised by the pilots, a Boeing spokesman said the company is “deeply saddened” by the recent plane crash in Indonesia and is working with officials to determine what went wrong. “We are taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this incident, working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved,” Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said. “We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing.” Authorities are trying to understand the implications of an Oct. 29 crash near Jakarta, Indonesia, in which a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet operated by Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea with 189 people on board. A “black box” flight data recorder recovered from the wreckage showed that the plane’s airspeed indicator had malfunctioned on its last four flights. The exact cause of the crash, however, remains unknown. In the meantime, airlines, pilots, regulators and jet manufacturers have been frantically reviewing flight protocols and systems to ensure passengers on other 737 MAX 8 jets are not put at risk. Updates issued last week by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines that erroneous sensor readings from an important flight control system could “cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,” and lead to “possible impact with terrain.” A feature in previous 737 models that allowed pilots to manually override an “electric trimming” process – which can automatically nudge the nose of the plane downward in certain situations – does not work in Boeing’s 737 MAX 8 planes, Boeing explained in a Nov. 7 bulletin. “This is the first description you, as 737 pilots, have seen,"" APA safety committee chairman Mike Michaelis told pilots Saturday in an advisory note obtained by The Washington Post and reported earlier by the Seattle Times. ""It is not in the [flight manuals]. It will be soon.” Pilots say it is important that they have the power to manually override automated systems. In the case of Lion Air Flight 610, a sensor that measures which way the plane’s nose is pointing apparently fed erroneous data into the system, something that could have sent the plane into a nosedive. The new flight-control systems “automatically put the nose down to keep the plane from stalling,"" Mary Schiavo, an airline lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department, said in an email. “But the pilots don’t know this and are not trained on this. So the pilots keep putting the nose up and the plane keeps putting the nose down.” Analysts caution against assigning blame before authorities complete their investigation. Still, the response from regulators and pilot representatives hints at a broader reckoning in the commercial aerospace industry over one of Boeing’s marquee jets, the 737 MAX 8. “There is not any commercial damage to Boeing, but reputationally they need to get ahead of this,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group."	583	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 303, ""text"": ""ial airline pilots at Southwest and American airlines were not informed during training about a new flight control system that may have played a role in the fatal crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Lion Air in Indonesia last month, pilot union representatives from both airlines said Tuesday"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 766, ""end"": 895, ""text"": ""When you’re responsible for that aircraft and there are systems on there that you have not been made aware of, that’s not right.\"""", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1154, ""end"": 1257, ""text"": ""“This was clearly a sign that the safety culture [at Boeing] was missing on a cylinder or two,” he said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1869, ""end"": 2071, ""text"": ""Authorities are trying to understand the implications of an Oct. 29 crash near Jakarta, Indonesia, in which a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet operated by Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea with 189 people on board"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3608, ""end"": 3967, ""text"": ""he new flight-control systems “automatically put the nose down to keep the plane from stalling,\"" Mary Schiavo, an airline lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department, said in an email. “But the pilots don’t know this and are not trained on this.

JAKARTA, Indonesia — Rescuers on Monday recovered the cockpit voice recorder from the Lion Air jet that crashed into the sea late last year, Indonesian officials said.  The data contained in the cockpit voice recorder, the second of the plane’s two “black box” recorders, is likely to bring investigators closer to finding out exactly what caused the almost-new Boeing jetliner to plunge into the water shortly after takeoff. The other, the flight data recorder, was found in November.  “The hydrography and oceanography center of the Indonesian navy, assisted by the National Transportation Safety Committee, discovered the cockpit voice recorder,” said Rear Adm. Harjo Susmoro, head of the Indonesian navy’s Hydrography and Oceanography Center. The recorder was found around 9:15 a.m. local time by a navy diver, officials added.  Harjo told The Washington Post that the recorder was found 108 feet under the sea. Despite stormy weather, a team of rescuers sifted through the mud to find the small bright-orange device buried under the seabed. They also found human remains and bones during the search, officials said. Strong currents in the Java Sea had complicated the search, as had the intensity of the crash, which scattered the plane’s wreckage all over the deep waters off the coast near Jakarta.  The search for the recorder had stopped briefly before resuming Tuesday. Soerjanto Tjahjono, who heads Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, said in a news conference Monday evening that the recorder will have to be dried and cleaned before data can be extracted from it.  “We hope that the process takes three to five days for everything to be downloaded,” he said. The cockpit voice recorder is in good condition with just scratches on it, officials added. Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, just 13 minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killing the eight crew members and 181 passengers on board, including a child and two infants. The jet was only about two months old. Investigators have narrowed in on a theory that a malfunctioning sensor and an automated response from the aircraft’s software — a feature of the new Boeing 737 Max 8 — stymied pilots’ efforts to control the flight. An “angle-of-attack” sensor, which measures where the plane’s nose was pointing, was showing erroneous readings throughout the short flight.  Information from the flight data recorder, which has been released by Indonesian investigators, show the pilots were pulling back on the control column, attempting to raise the plane’s nose, with almost 100 pounds of pressure before they crashed. The cockpit voice recorder is likely to chronicle the steps taken by the pilots in the final moments of the flight.  The crash, one of the worst in Indonesia in recent years, has highlighted the country’s patchy aviation safety record, as well as potential issues with the Boeing 737 Max 8 model. The aircraft is the most popular in Boeing’s history, and Lion Air is among the fastest-growing carriers in Indonesia. Both companies have said they are cooperating with investigators on determining the cause of the crash. shibani.mahtani@washpost.com	582	"[{""start"": 1782, ""end"": 2005, ""text"": ""Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, just 13 minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killing the eight crew members and 181 passengers on board, including a child and two infants."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2006, ""end"": 2259, ""text"": ""he jet was only about two months old.

Chicago-based aerospace giant Boeing announced late Monday that it would update flight control systems on its 737 Max 8 commercial jetliners after the plane was involved in two deadly accidents in the past five months. The move came hours after the Federal Aviation Administration issued an advisory mandating specific “design changes” no later than April 2019. For months Boeing has faced harsh criticism from pilot groups, which took issue with a decision to update the plane’s flight controls without detailing the changes in pilot training. “Boeing has been working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on development, planning and certification of the software enhancement, and it will be deployed across the 737 Max fleet in the coming weeks,” the company wrote. “The update also incorporates feedback received from our customers.” The announcement comes amid a broader crisis for Boeing in which the safety of the latest model of its best-selling commercial aircraft has been called into question. On Sunday morning a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board, just months after a brand-new 737 Max 8 went down in Indonesia on Oct. 31, killing 189. The cause of the crash in Ethiopia remains inconclusive, with an inquiry into its causes in its earliest days. Although it was too soon to confirm the exact cause of the Ethiopian Air crash, the new Boeing 737 showed a similar flight path to the plane that went down in Indonesia. The Federal Aviation Administration said in its advisory Monday that it had not been provided with any information that would draw similarities between the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia. But even before the cause of the crash was known, Chinese regulators ordered domestic airlines there to suspend all flights involving the 737 Max 8. Regulators in Singapore ordered the suspension of the aircraft Monday evening, according to news reports. The company’s statement did not reference the downed Ethiopian flight, though it expressed sympathy for those who lost loved ones Sunday. The company said it was “deeply saddened” by the Lion Air crash that occurred months earlier and said it had been working on a software fix for months. “For the past several months and in the aftermath of Lion Air Flight 610, Boeing has been developing a flight control software enhancement for the 737 Max, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer,” the company said in a statement, noting that the updates included changes to “flight control law, pilot displays, operation manuals and crew training” ― issues that were central to concerns raised by pilot groups. A preliminary investigation into the cause of the plane crash in Indonesia found that a malfunctioning sensor and an automated response from the plane’s flight control system left pilots struggling to gain control of the aircraft as it tilted downward into a nose-dive, later crashing into the Java Sea. The report stopped short of assigning blame for the crash. But pilot organizations in the United States criticized Boeing after it disclosed that it had added a new feature to the plane’s autopilot system without detailing the changes in pilot training. The new feature, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, was designed to account for minor modifications to the placement of the plane’s engines. In the process it changed a manual override feature that allowed pilots to pull the plane out of a nose-dive by pulling back on its control column. While Boeing maintains that processes are in place to overcome the “automatic trim” that nudges the nose of the plane downward in some circumstances, pilot unions say the change was not adequately outlined in pilot training. The Federal Aviation Administration advisory Monday asked for a number of changes to the 737 Max 8 and Max 9 jet models specifically referenced in the MCAS system, including “activation enhancements,” “signal enhancements,” operations manuals and a pilot checklist.	581	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 217, ""text"": ""o-based aerospace giant Boeing announced late Monday that it would update flight control systems on its 737 Max 8 commercial jetliners after the plane was involved in two deadly accidents in the past five months"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1023, ""end"": 1241, ""text"": ""n Sunday morning a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board, just months after a brand-new 737 Max 8 went down in Indonesia on Oct. 31, killing 189"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1767, ""end"": 1971, ""text"": ""Chinese regulators ordered domestic airlines there to suspend all flights involving the 737 Max 8.

U.S. air safety officials are assisting in the investigation into the crash of an Ethio­pian Airlines plane bound for Nairobi that went down Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, including eight Americans. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board will take part in the probe, officials said, and U.S. airlines are keeping an eye on the investigation to determine how it could affect their fleets, several of which contain the same 737 MAX 8 model aircraft that crashed in Ethi­o­pia. It was the second fatal crash recently involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 model. In October, a Lion Air plane crashed into the waters off the coast of Java, killing all 189 passengers and crew on board. Though Sunday’s flight did not originate in the United States, U.S. authorities were assisting in an advisory capacity because Boeing is based in Chicago. Although it was too soon to determine the exact cause of the Ethio­pian Air crash, the plane, which was brand new, showed a similar flight path to the one in the Indonesia crash. An NTSB spokesman said the investigative agency is sending a team of four to assist Ethio­pian authorities. An accident investigator and others providing technical expertise will serve as the response team. The crews have expertise in systems, structures, power plants and operations, according to the safety body. NTSB says it is an “accredited representative” to the investigation, which is being handled by Ethio­pian authorities. The group that will be sent to Ethi­o­pia is smaller than a “go team” that would be sent to a crash on U.S. soil, which could consist of a dozen to 25 people, but Ethio­pian authorities are conducting a sweeping investigation of the crash. The pilot, who was identified by relatives as senior Captain Yared Getachew, 28, of Addis Ababa, had family who reside in Northern Virginia and Texas. The airline confirmed Getachew was the pilot. “We are deeply saddened by the news of the passing of our dear Yared,” the family said in a statement. “With his impeccable record as a pilot, he was one of the youngest in Ethiopian Airlines history to captain a Boeing 737. As a confident captain, his seniority at Ethiopian Airlines comes with an accomplished record of 8,000 hours flight time, and has made us incredibly proud of his achievements.” The crash brought new scrutiny to Boeing’s 737 MAX family of aircraft, the latest generation of what the company describes as the “most popular jet aircraft of all time.” Boeing boasts the new model has an improved cabin and more advanced flying technology — including, for example, a sensor system meant to take over and correct the plane’s angle if it is pointed too far upward. But experts have warned that faulty sensors can put the aircraft at risk by sending it plummeting while in a climb. Boeing issued an emergency notice after the Lion Air crash that said a malfunctioning sensor could “cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,” leading to “possible impact with terrain.” The MAX 8, the variant that seats up to 210, has been involved in the two most catastrophic airline crashes in recent history. Southwest Airlines, which has 34 of the 737 MAX 8 planes in service, said it has been in touch with Boeing and plans to follow the investigation closely. It had not made any changes to its operations or inspection protocol Sunday, the airline said. “We remain confident in the safety and airworthiness of our fleet of more than 750 Boeing aircraft,” Southwest said. American Airlines said it was closely monitoring the investigation but remained confident in the safety of its aircraft. It was too early to know what could come of the Ethio­pian Airlines investigation, including what safety directives might be issued for the aircraft involved in the crash, officials said. Experts urged caution, because while the crashes — shortly after takeoff, at relatively low altitudes with erratic flight patterns — draw similarities, the data is insufficient to conclude the same systems were at fault. It was unclear, for example, whether the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS) that was the subject of scrutiny in the Lion Air crash was a potential factor in Sunday’s Ethio­pian Airlines crash. “Because of the apparent similarities between and this and the Lion Air crash, the questions naturally arise: Is this a similar crash? And is MCAS the culprit?” said aviation consultant Scott Hamilton, managing director of Leeham Company, which provides aviation expertise and marketing analysis. “It may well turn out that there is a connection, but we don’t know that today.” Hamilton said the cockpit voice recorders and flight-data recorders would provide critical information on what transpired in the six minutes between the flight’s takeoff and the crash. Not enough was known Sunday to draw parallels between the two crashes. “It’s highly unusual for a new model airplane to have one accident let alone two in such a short period of time,” he said. “And of course investigators are going to look at the flight-tracker radar pattern, the circumstances, and one of the first things they’re going to zero in on when they get the [flight-data recorders] and the [cockpit voice recorders] . . . they’re going to look at MCAS performance. That’s going be a natural thing for them to do.” The results of the probes could have major consequences because the 737 MAX is being rolled out widely across the aviation industry. Boeing says it was the fastest-selling airplane in its history and nearly 5,000 orders have been placed. Several hundred are in service, including with U.S. carriers Southwest and American Airlines. Southwest’s fleet is made up entirely of 737s, and the airline had received 31 out of an order of 280 MAX 8 aircraft by January, according to Boeing. American had received 22 out of an order of 100. A faulty sensor was cited in the Lion Air crash, though authorities have not yet completed their investigation. Officials said the “angle of attack” sensor was the component involved in that incident, causing the plane to dip whenever pilots attempted to adjust the plane’s pitch. The sensor repeatedly read that the plane was too high, even when it wasn’t, and sent it plummeting during repeated attempts to correct its course. The aircraft eventually crashed into the Java Sea. Preliminary data showed the Ethio­pian Airlines flight following a similar flight path. Ethio­pian Airlines said its investigators, the Ethio­pian Civil Aviation Authority and the Ethio­pian Transport Authority will conduct the investigation “in collaboration with all stakeholders including the aircraft manufacturer Boeing” to determine the cause of the crash. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a brief statement saying it was planning to assist in the investigation of the crash, which killed eight Americans and 18 Canadians. “The FAA is closely monitoring developments in the Ethiopian Flight 302 crash early this morning,” the agency said in a statement. “We are in contact with the State Department and plan to join the NTSB in its assistance with Ethiopian civil aviation authorities to investigate the crash.” Boeing declined Sunday to say whether the crash would prompt immediate action concerning the safety of the 737 MAX aircraft, as some pushed for answers on whether a second catastrophic crash will lead the manufacturer to ground its new planes or issue a new safety directive. More than a week after the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a bulletin detailing the process for pilots to override the safety system cited in the crash. The manufacturer said in a statement that it is “deeply saddened” by the deaths of the 157 on board Sunday. “We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethio­pian Airlines team,” Boeing said. The company said it is sending a technical team to the crash site to assist U.S. and Ethio­pian authorities in their investigation. faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com	580	"[{""start"": 523, ""end"": 719, ""text"": ""It was the second fatal crash recently involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 model.

After days of resistance, the United States on Wednesday followed its counterparts around the world in grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8, the aircraft involved in a deadly crash in Ethi­o­pia on Sunday and another several months ago in Indonesia. Federal Aviation Administration officials said that airplane tracking data they viewed Wednesday and new evidence from the wreckage of the crash in Ethiopia showed similarities to the crash in Indonesia, leading the agency to ground both the 737 Max 8 and the Max 9, another aircraft in the series. President Trump announced the abrupt about-face Wednesday, after U.S. officials found themselves nearly alone in allowing the planes to remain in the air. As recently as Wednesday morning, both Boeing and the FAA had continued to say it was safe for the planes to fly. “Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice,” Trump said at an afternoon news conference. “The safety of the American people, and all people, is our paramount concern.” But there were growing questions about the slow response to the crisis and whether the nation’s top air-safety officials acted quickly enough to protect the flying public. Trump took the unusual step of consulting personally with Boeing’s chief executive earlier this week. In the months leading up to the crash of Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302, U.S. pilots had expressed exasperation about the aircraft’s systems, which they said limited their control of the planes, according to a confidential safety reporting system hosted by NASA. Pilots complained of inadequate training on automation-assisted flying systems, unfamiliarity with the controls, anxiety that prompted them to engage auto­pilot earlier than normal, and at least two instances where the plane pitched downward or maneuvered against pilots’ inputs. Some of the pilot complaints were first reported by the Dallas Morning News. The FAA denied that the pilots’ complaints were indicative of problems with the automation system that has been cited as a factor in the Indonesia crash, but some pilots specifically noted that system as a possible cause of flight-control problems in their reports to NASA. Trump’s announcement came hours after one by Canada’s transportation minister grounding the jets. Canada had been the last major holdout besides the United States. China was the first major power to ground the planes, followed by countries around the world. On Tuesday, the European Union and several others did the same. Chinese officials said they acted after the FAA failed to do so. The FAA’s emergency order Wednesday states that the similarities in the Ethi­o­pia and Indonesia tragedies “warrant further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents that needs to be better understood and addressed.” A McLean, Va.-based aerospace firm, Aireon, used its plane-tracking technology to help investigators get a clearer idea of the way the Ethiopian Airlines plane was moving and how that compared to the Oct. 29 Lion Air flight, acting FAA administrator Daniel K. Elwell said. An initial batch of raw data was essentially too fuzzy to be helpful, and the FAA lacked the ability to refine it into usable form on its own, Elwell said. But Aireon, with help from Boeing and the National Transportation Safety Board, were able to “refine the initial return of the satellites to create a description of the flight,” Elwell said. “The track of the Ethiopian Airlines flight was very close — and behaved very similarly — to the Lion Air flight.” Aviation experts said the two planes headed up and down multiple times after takeoff. A preliminary report by Indonesian authorities found that a faulty sensor prompted an automation feature on the plane to repeatedly force the plane to descend, until it crashed and killed all on board. The investigation into the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in the earliest stages, and it is not clear whether hardware problems, software problems or some combination of factors caused the crash. Elwell said that “we still have a lot to learn before we can say they were the same cause and effect.” Elwell also said important “physical evidence” was pulled from the wreckage linking the two flights, though he said he could not describe it because the United States is a party to the active investigation. Yet that evidence “helped us have more fidelity on the flight track, what was happening during the flight, and that evidence aligns the Ethiopian flight closer to what we know happened in Lion Air,” Elwell said. “That’s about all I can say.” The order will ground more than 70 aircraft. In the United States, the aircraft is used by American and Southwest airlines, which combined have 58 Max 8s in their fleets. United Airlines has 14 of the Max 9 planes. Boeing said that it continues to have full confidence in the safety of the Max 8 and Max 9 but that after consulting with the FAA, the NTSB, aviation authorities and its customers, it decided to suspend operations of its global fleet of more than 370 Max aircraft. “Boeing has determined — out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft’s safety — to recommend to the FAA the temporary suspension of operations of the entire global fleet of 371 737 MAX aircraft,” the company said in a statement, adding that it supported the FAA’s decision. “We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again,” the company said. Officials at American Airlines — which, along with a union representing its pilots, had reiterated its belief that the planes were safe to fly — said they were now being grounded out of “an abundance of caution.” “Our teams will be working to rebook customers as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience,” the airline said. Southwest said it was “immediately complying” with the FAA order, noting that it operates a fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737s and that the 34 Max 8s in its fleet “account for less than five percent of our daily flights.” “While we remain confident in the MAX 8 after completing more than 88,000 flight hours accrued over 41,000 flights, we support the actions of the FAA and other regulatory agencies and governments across the globe that have asked for further review of the data — including information from the flight data recorder — related to the recent accident involving the MAX 8,” Southwest said. Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he issued a “safety notice” grounding the flights Wednesday after newly available satellite data was reviewed. “My experts have looked at this and compared it to the flight that occurred with Lion Air six months ago in October, and . . . there are similarities that sort of exceed a certain threshold in our minds with respect to the possible cause of what happened in Ethi­o­pia,” Garneau said. At a Wednesday afternoon news conference, Elwell, of the FAA, said delays in getting the damaged flight-data recorders to a place where information could be retrieved contributed to the agency’s decision to ground the planes. Ethiopia has the capability to read black boxes but not heavily damaged ones as in this case, he said. The plan was to have them on a plane to France on Wednesday night, he said. “We had been hopeful all along, with the black boxes being discovered so soon after the incident, that we could get them on a table and start pulling data to help us inform our decision one way or another” about whether to ground the airplanes, Elwell said. “That process was lengthened more than I had hoped, to the point where the boxes still are in Ethiopia. But at least now we have a plan to get them out of country.” Asked what role U.S. investigators will play in analyzing the black box data, Elwell said, per international protocol, Ethiopia is taking the lead — “their soil, their aircraft, their airline,” he said. But he said U.S. inspectors have been cooperating with their Ethiopian counterparts from the onset of the tragedy and will continue to do so. “Together, FAA and NTSB are helping [the] Ethiopian accident investigation board,” he said. The preliminary report on the Oct. 29 Lion Air Flight 610 crash found that a device known as an “angle of attack” sensor had mistakenly indicated the plane’s nose was too high, prompting the plane’s automation software to push the plane downward. The Lion Air pilots fought to raise the plane’s nose but were unable to, sending the plane crashing into the Java Sea. In November, an American Airlines spokesman said that the airline followed all procedures outlined by Boeing and in an emergency directive from the FAA in the wake of the Lion Air crash. The airline said Wednesday that it has reviewed data for more than 14,000 flights since the Lion Air crash and has not seen a single anomaly related to the sensor. “At American, we have not had similar issues regarding an erroneous Angle of Attack during manual flight,” spokesman Ross Feinstein said, responding to questions about pilot complaints and concerns about flying a Max 8. American’s fleet of 24 Max 8 aircraft first went into operation in November 2017 and have a combined total of more than 46,400 operating hours and nearly 18,000 cycles. Officials around the world had cited the absence of clear information from the Ethio­pian Airlines plane to call for the Boeing jets to be grounded. The data from the two flight recorders are eagerly awaited as investigators look for connections. After China grounded the plane Monday, most countries followed suit, including much of Europe. Bans were also issued by India, Egypt, Uzbekistan, Turkey and Hong Kong. Ethio­pian Airlines chief executive Tewolde GebreMariam told CNN on Tuesday that the pilot reported “flight control problems” and asked to return to the airport. He cast doubt on the airworthiness of the 737 Max. “Two major fatal accidents on the same airplane model, brand new airplane model, in six months — so there are a lot of questions to be answered on the airplane,” he said. In remarks to local media, Tewolde also revealed that pilots received additional training from Boeing to fly the 737 Max after the Lion Air crash. “After the Lion Air crash, questions were raised, so Boeing sent further instructions that it said pilots should know,” he said, according to the Associated Press. “Those relate to the specific behavior of this specific type of aircraft. As a result, training was given by Boeing, and our pilots have taken it and put it into our manuals.” Elwell said he expects a software fix developed by Boeing after the Lion Air crash to be finalized in the near future. “We’re hopeful the final touches and tests and evaluation of the software amendment, or the software addition to the Max, will be ready within a couple months. We have not tied the order specifically to the software patch,” he said. Elwell said he is “confident that the patch is going to be an enhancement to the system and make it far less likely that crews, if faced with that very anomalous situation, far less likely to have to deal with that particular malfunction.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — Ethiopian Airlines pilots received new training for the type of plane that crashed Sunday after its manufacturer, Boeing, issued a directive for it following an earlier crash in Indonesia, an airline spokesman confirmed Wednesday. Since Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302 crashed just six minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 passengers and crew, public concerns have focused largely on the type of aircraft involved, the Boeing 737 Max 8. Most airline markets worldwide have grounded the plane pending an investigation. The United States followed suit Wednesday. Following the crash of a Max 8 on an Indonesian domestic flight shortly after takeoff on Oct. 29, Boeing issued a bulletin warning about potential problems with an automated anti-stalling system on the plane that could push the nose down. Ethio­pian Airlines spokesman Biniyam Demssie said in an interview that the procedures for disabling the system were then incorporated into pilot training. “All the pilots flying the Max received the training after the Indonesia crash,” he said. “There was a directive by Boeing, so they took that training.” The bulletin from Boeing described how erroneous data from a sensor could cause an automatic system to push the nose of the plane down and how to correct for that. The airline’s new training schedule for 737 pilots also includes dealing with this runaway stabilizer. Preliminary reports from last year’s crash of an Indonesian Lion Air flight indicated that the pilots were wrestling to pull up the plane when it went down in the Java Sea. In both incidents, the trouble started immediately after takeoff, with an erratic flight path that ascended and then descended before the plane crashed minutes later. Ethio­pian Airlines chief executive Tewolde GebreMariam told CNN on Tuesday that the pilot in Sunday’s crash reported “flight control problems” soon after takeoff and asked to return to the airport. While Tewolde said the cause of the crash was not yet clear, he cast doubt on the airworthiness of the 737 Max. In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he called for all countries to ground the plane. “There are some similarities that we are able to trace or connect the dots between the Lion Air accident and our accident,” he said. “For us, it was appropriate in the extreme precaution of safety that we had to ground the airplane,” he said. “I recommend that it is the right thing to do because safety . . . should be the first and extreme precaution [that] should be taken, and that is what has been done.” Demssie, the spokesman, said the flight’s “black boxes,” the voice and data recorders, would be sent to Europe for analysis, although the specific country has not been chosen. The data from the two flight recorders is eagerly awaited as worry grows that the cause of Sunday’s crash could be related to the automated system aboard the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. paul.schemm@washpost.com	578	"[{""start"": 257, ""end"": 462, ""text"": ""Since Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302 crashed just six minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 passengers and crew, public concerns have focused largely on the type of aircraft involved, the Boeing 737 Max 8"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 464, ""end"": 586, ""text"": ""Most airline markets worldwide have grounded the plane pending an investigation.

"In a sign of how the credibility of the Federal Aviation Administration has been undermined in recent weeks, House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio on Tuesday said “independent, third-party” reviewers must confirm that software and other fixes for Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jets are sufficient before the FAA allows the planes to fly again. “The traveling public needs assurances that the FAA will only recertify the aircraft for flight if and when the FAA, outside safety and technical experts, and pilots agree the aircraft is safe to fly,” DeFazio (D-Ore.) said. Those safety assurances are usually provided by the FAA itself. But the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 jets in less than five months, killing 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia, have raised questions about the process Boeing and the FAA used to certify the planes were safe and the aircraft’s automated features were sufficiently understood by pilots. The independent review, which DeFazio said has bipartisan support, should evaluate whether Boeing’s fixes are “comprehensive” and if “pilots have the information and training they need to fly these aircraft safely.” DeFazio said later this week he will also “submit document requests to the FAA and Boeing to drill down into key certification decisions regarding the Max.” An FAA spokesman said the agency had not yet seen DeFazio’s formal request and had “no basis to comment.” Boeing did not immediately comment on DeFazio’s statement, but a spokesman said the company “is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available” and has worked with the FAA, Transportation Department, pilots, airlines and others “for decades to make flying the world’s safest mode of transportation.” The FAA was among the last civil aviation authorities to ground the planes after the crash in Ethiopia earlier this month, with agency officials saying they lacked the data needed to act. In the wake of the disasters, international aviation safety authorities have not been as deferential to the FAA, which has had a vital role in the United States’ exceedingly safe aviation record. “I expect that our work will shed light on any deficiencies in the certification of aircraft in the United States and we will ensure that all lessons are applied and affect changes to improve the safety of our air transportation system and, hopefully, other nations’ as well,” DeFazio said. Boeing has in recent days been showing pilots software fixes that would change the way some of the Max jets’ automated safety features behave and what information they rely on. Pilots in the October crash in Indonesia appeared to struggle against an automated feature known as MCAS, which is designed to push the nose of the plane down if an external sensor detects the plane may be stalling, according to a preliminary report. The fixes, among other things, will stop the plane from relying on data from a single outside sensor, and temper how much the anti-stall feature would push the nose downward, the company said. The Justice Department’s criminal division is looking into the Max jets; the Transportation Department’s inspector general is investigating the way they were certified; Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has created an “expert special committee” to review certification procedures for the planes; and Congress is investigating and planning several hearings, including one Wednesday. DeFazio’s committee is investigating the FAA’s certification of the plane, including the “roles and responsibilities” of the FAA and Boeing, he said. Congress has, for many years, instructed the FAA to hand over more of its safety oversight responsibilities to companies such as Boeing. A stated goal was to increase efficiency at the agency, which critics within the industry and on Capitol Hill said was too slow in certifying the extraordinarily complex aircraft, slowing economic growth. DeFazio’s transportation committee is also probing “how the safety critical systems that did not exist on prior 737 models were tested, evaluated, and assumed to be safe” and “why the Max was certified without requiring additional pilot training, among other things,” DeFazio said. DeFazio asked the Transportation Department’s inspector general to investigate how the FAA evaluated new features on the planes, including “sensors and software, pilot training programs and manuals, and how new features were communicated to airlines, pilots, and foreign authorities.” He “also requested that the Inspector general provide us with status reports on any corrective actions undertaken by the FAA since the first accident and whether pilot training is adequate before the Max returns to revenue service."""	577	"[{""start"": 641, ""end"": 930, ""text"": ""But the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 jets in less than five months, killing 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia, have raised questions about the process Boeing and the FAA used to certify the planes were safe and the aircraft’s automated features were sufficiently understood by pilots"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2597, ""end"": 2847, ""text"": ""Pilots in the October crash in Indonesia appeared to struggle against an automated feature known as MCAS, which is designed to push the nose of the plane down if an external sensor detects the plane may be stalling, according to a preliminary report."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	556	2023-04-13T08:24:06.662596Z	2023-04-13T08:24:06.662703Z	309.91
A day after the second deadly crash since October of a popular new plane model, countries and airlines began grounding flights of the Boeing 737 Max 8. By the afternoon of the third day, U.S. carriers were the only major operators still flying the planes, and President Trump announced that those flights would be grounded as well. All 157 people aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were killed near Bishoftu, Ethiopia, on March 10 after a six-minute flight in which the jet’s altitude and airspeed climbed and dipped erratically. More than 8,800 flights of the 737 Max 8s (and similar Max 9s) occur around the world in a typical week. These latest versions of the popular 737 have more fuel-efficient engines than their predecessors, and Boeing hopes the new line will compete successfully with European rival Airbus. Roughly 60 airlines operate at least one of these planes, which debuted in 2017, and thousands more have been ordered. Worldwide, 427 of the planes have been allocated so far, 76 to U.S. airlines Southwest (34), American (26) and United (16), according to a compilation by Flightradar24. Not all allocated planes are flying routes yet. Several countries stopped all flights of the planes on Monday, most notably China and Indonesia, where the other Max 8 crash occurred in October. Ethiopian Airlines and several carriers also grounded their own Max 8 jets. By the time the United Kingdom and Germany banned the jets from its airspace on Tuesday, the list of countries and airlines that wouldn’t fly the planes had grown to include Australia, Oman, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency took the step later in the day. Canada grounded the jets Wednesday morning, followed by the United States in the afternoon. Transponder data shows that the operation of Flight 302 was abnormal almost from the start on Sunday, according to Ian Petchenik of Flightradar24. For the first five minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, Flight 302’s climb should have been a more or less continuous upward angle, Petchenik said, like the paths of two previous flights on the same route in previous days. But Flight 302 wobbled up and down until the surveillance sensors lost track of it three minutes into the flight. An Ethiopian Airlines executive said the pilot radioed that he was having problems and wanted to return to the airport. He then lost contact with air traffic control. The flight’s vertical airspeed trajectory should have been a smooth upward trend as well, getting faster until it leveled off. But this flight slowed drastically and sped up sharply during its short time in the air. While it is too early to know what caused the crash, the circumstances are similar to an October crash in Indonesia in which a Lion Air flight from Jakarta nose-dived into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff. Data in that crash showed dramatic fluctuations in altitude during which pilots fought to keep the plane in the air. As with the Ethiopian Air flight, the Lion Air pilots had tried to return to the airport. After the Indonesia crash, a preliminary investigation blamed a malfunctioning sensor. Boeing issued a warning to airlines that operate Max 8 and 9 planes about erroneous readings from flight-control software on the planes. The warning said an “angle of attack” sensor that had been replaced the day before had malfunctioned; a bad reading by that sensor can cause a plane to dive suddenly. Monday night Boeing said it would release a software update “no later than April.”	576	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 150, ""text"": ""fter the second deadly crash since October of a popular new plane model, countries and airlines began grounding flights of the Boeing 737 Max 8"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 152, ""end"": 330, ""text"": ""By the afternoon of the third day, U.S. carriers were the only major operators still flying the planes, and President Trump announced that those flights would be grounded as well"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 332, ""end"": 531, ""text"": ""ll 157 people aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were killed near Bishoftu, Ethiopia, on March 10 after a six-minute flight in which the jet’s altitude and airspeed climbed and dipped erratically."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1684, ""end"": 1775, ""text"": ""Canada grounded the jets Wednesday morning, followed by the United States in the afternoon."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1776, ""end"": 2057, ""text"": ""ransponder data shows that the operation of Flight 302 was abnormal almost from the start on Sunday, according to Ian Petchenik of Flightradar24.

Boeing’s latest airliners lack a common override feature that, in some dangerous circumstances, allows pilots to reliably pull planes out of nosedives and avert crashes such as last month’s fatal plunge by Lion Air Flight 610, aeronautics experts and pilot groups say. The state-of-the-art 737 MAX 8 airplanes do not have this feature, yet the company failed to prominently warn pilots of the change even as airlines worldwide began taking delivery of the new jets last year, pilots say. “We were completely in the dark,” said Dennis Tajer, a 737 pilot and spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, representing American Airlines pilots. Questions surrounding the crash have turned a harsh spotlight on Boeing’s latest update to its workhorse 737 line, the world’s most popular commercial airliner. Boeing’s stock is down nearly 12 percent since the Oct. 29 crash, even after a slight uptick on Wednesday amid a broad market upswing. Revelations about the doomed Lion Air flight, released Wednesday in a preliminary report by Indonesian investigators, also exacerbated long-standing debates over what degree of automation is safest for airplanes — and how human pilots should be able to take full control. “Automation is there to make us safer and more productive in the cockpit,” said Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, a union representing pilots at Southwest Airlines. “But that never replaces the overriding commandment that the pilot has to fly the airplane and know what the aircraft is doing.” Boeing said in a statement Wednesday that it had addressed the “flight control functionality” of its updated automated system with more than 60 airlines worldwide and at regional conferences since 2016. “We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX,” the company said. “Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing. We are taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this accident, working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved. While we can’t discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation, we have provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.” The Boeing 737 aircraft first flew in 1967 and — with several iterations and upgrades — quickly became the mainstay of international short-haul aviation. The 737 MAX is the fastest-selling plane in Boeing history, with almost 4,700 planes sold or on order, and it is flown by nearly 40 airlines worldwide. Boeing issued a bulletin on Nov. 6 that described how 737 MAX pilots should override the automated system suspected of causing the Lion Air crash. The investigative report, which stops short of determining the cause of the crash, chronicles the chaotic moments aboard Flight 610 before it hit the waters off the coast of Java last month, killing all 189 passengers and crew on board. That end came after a battle between its flight crew and a computerized control system that repeatedly tilted the plane downward because of a malfunctioning sensor, according to the report. Correcting the path of the plane would have required a multistep process, something that pilots and other aeronautics experts said may have been difficult to remember and execute during a life-threatening emergency. Members of the Lion Air flight crew repeatedly attempted to manually arrest the plane’s dive, but the system reasserted itself each time. The crew lost control of the jet, which struck the water at 450 miles per hour, the report found. “What they were focused on was keeping the airplane in the air,” said Clint R. Balog, a pilot and aeronautics expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “That’s always your first priority. You troubleshoot problems only after you’ve got the aircraft safe.” Previous iterations of 737s would have switched off key automatic control features when the pilot first pulled back the control column, a standard manual override feature in generations of airplanes. Investigators found that the final yank on the control column of Flight 610 registered almost 100 pounds of pressure, suggesting desperation in the cockpit as the plane plummeted. Pilots expressed concern about the changing nature of the controls and Boeing’s delayed disclosure of the change. The company sent out its public alert more than a week after the Lion Air crash. Tajer and others said they were aware of no earlier notice of the change in how 737 MAX planes operate compared with their predecessors. Aeronautics consultant Douglas M. Moss, a retired United Airlines pilot, said that Boeing and government regulators, among others, share blame for allowing the delivery of planes that operated in unexpected ways during emergencies and for failing to make the changes clear to pilots charged with flying them safely. “All those systems failed the crew and passengers,” said Moss, of AeroPacific Consulting. For pilots of a diving plane, he added, “the initial instinctive reaction is to pull back the control column, and in this case, that’s not going to work for very long.” Moss said that aircraft makers seek market advantage by convincing buyers that new generations of planes can be easily flown by existing pilots, without expensive new training. The computer system that failed, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, sought to make the 737 MAX operate as similarly as possible to the older 737s, despite having larger engines placed farther forward on the wings.  The investigation found that, for days before the crash, the 737 MAX had experienced trouble with a sensor that measures the plane’s “angle of attack” — essentially whether it is dipping down, tipping up or level. The malfunctioning sensor is key to correct operation of the MCAS, which is charged with detecting and correcting dangerous stalls.  The report suggests the MCAS acted as though the plane was stalling because it was receiving incorrect information from the faulty sensor. Every time the flight crew pulled the nose back to level, within seconds, the MCAS tipped it back downward. The Federal Aviation Administration reiterated the caution in Boeing’s bulletin. “What we do as a matter of practice when any manufacturer puts out a bulletin such as this, we put out what’s called an Airworthiness Directive,” said Gregory Martin, of the FAA, “which gives those instructions and procedures the full weight of the legal authority of the FAA to ensure that those bulletins are performed.” The pilots’ concerns echoed a broader debate over how commercial jets can be automated safely. Manufacturers including Airbus and Boeing have been integrating computerized processes into commercial piloting procedures since the 1980s. The Airbus A320 sparked controversy after it was introduced in 1988 because it was among the first planes to have its flight functions directed via computer as opposed to stick and rudder controls. In 1988, an Airbus A320 crashed at a French air show, killing a woman and two children. That accident was ultimately attributed to pilot error, but the pilot reportedly blamed factors including incorrect altitude information fed through the plane’s computers.  In the decades since, computerized processes have been integrated into nearly every industry. Experts say automation has made airlines safer. “Automation isn’t the debate,” said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group aerospace consultancy. “It’s about the ease of manual override and the extent to which that is included in training and communications.” craig.timberg@washpost.com aaron.gregg@washpost.com ashley.halsey@washpost.com	575	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 267, ""text"": ""’s latest airliners lack a common override feature that, in some dangerous circumstances, allows pilots to reliably pull planes out of nosedives and avert crashes such as last month’s fatal plunge by Lion Air Flight 610, aeronautics experts and pilot groups say"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 269, ""end"": 486, ""text"": ""The state-of-the-art 737 MAX 8 airplanes do not have this feature, yet the company failed to prominently warn pilots of the change even as airlines worldwide began taking delivery of the new jets last year, pilots say"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2539, ""end"": 2921, ""text"": ""Boeing issued a bulletin on Nov. 6 that described how 737 MAX pilots should override the automated system suspected of causing the Lion Air crash.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — A new Ethio­pian Airlines plane bound for Nairobi crashed Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, including eight Americans and 18 Canadians. The recently acquired aircraft was the same Boeing 737 Max 8 model that was involved in a crash in Indonesia in October. The preliminary investigation into the October crash focused on a malfunctioning sensor and computer system that pushed down the plane’s nose. Data from the Ethio­pian Airlines crash appears to show a similar erratic flight path, with the plane first ascending, then descending, then ascending sharply before it fell from the sky. According to Ethio­pian Airlines’ chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, the flight took off at 8:38 a.m. and lost contact with air traffic control six minutes later, crashing near Bishoftu, less than 40 miles southeast of Addis Ababa. “The pilot mentioned he had difficulty and he wanted to return, so he was given clearance to Addis,” GebreMariam said. “It is a brand new airplane, it had no technical remarks and was flown by a senior pilot, and there is no cause we can see at this time,” he added, saying the plane was only four months old, had flown 1,200 hours and had arrived from Johannesburg that morning. The pilot has been identified as Yared Getachew, 28, of Addis Ababa. According to a statement issued by relatives in Northern Virginia, Getachew had 8,000 hours of flight time and was the youngest pilot in Ethio­pian Airlines history to captain a Boeing 737. GebreMariam would not speculate on the causes of the crash and said the investigation would involve Ethiopia’s civil aviation authority, representatives of Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Flight data viewed by The Washington Post shows the flight getting into trouble almost immediately after departure. A normal takeoff for most passenger jets involves a steady climb to about a thousand feet, followed by an accelerating climb. However, on this flight, a minute and a half after its takeoff, the plane inexplicably began to descend — for nearly a minute — before climbing again. During that time, the plane’s speed kept increasing to what is far above normal for that phase of a takeoff. The plane underwent a sharp pull up — 600 feet in just 10 seconds — and was flying at 380 nautical miles per hour, when about 270 would be closer to normal. Three minutes later, it crashed. The victims included people of more than 30 nationalities, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians, eight Italians, eight Americans and seven Britons, as well as four people who held passports of the United Nations. Among the dead was Cedric Asiavugwa, a third-year student at Georgetown University Law Center and a member of the school’s campus ministry. The airline set up emergency hotline numbers for families and friends of victims and changed the cover image on its Facebook page to black. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the crash site and expressed his “profound sadness at the loss of life” and wished “healing to friends and families of the bereaved.” Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also tweeted his condolences. Ethio­pian Airlines announced the acquisition of the Max aircraft in July. Six others are in service to the airline, and GebreMariam said there are no plans to suspend their use. The Max model is the newest version of Boeing’s workhorse 737, the world’s most popular commercial aircraft. Boeing issued a statement saying that it was “deeply saddened” about the crash, adding that a “Boeing technical team will be travelling to the crash site to provide technical assistance under the direction of the Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.” After the October crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency notice that an erroneous sensor input could “cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,” leading to “possible impact with terrain.” In that crash, a malfunctioning sensor convinced the airplane’s software that the flight was stalling and corrected by pointing the nose down. Rescuers in January found the cockpit voice recorder from the Lion Air flight. Investigators have downloaded data from both of the aircraft’s data recorders — or black boxes — and are using it to aid in an ongoing investigation into what caused the crash. The full investigation is expected to be completed later this year, probably in November, Indonesian officials say. Ethio­pian Airlines is Africa’s largest airline in terms of destinations and passengers served. It has ambitions of serving as the gateway to Africa and is widely seen as one of the best managed airlines on the continent. It serves more than 100 destinations, including Washington, New York and Chicago. The airline’s last major crash was in 2010, when an aircraft caught fire and plunged into the Mediterranean after taking off from Beirut’s airport, killing all 90 people on board. Bad weather and a technical fault were cited. paul.schemm@washpost.com	574	"[{""start"": 6, ""end"": 168, ""text"": ""ABABA, Ethi­o­pia — A new Ethio­pian Airlines plane bound for Nairobi crashed Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, including eight Americans and 18 Canadians."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 169, ""end"": 619, ""text"": ""The recently acquired aircraft was the same Boeing 737 Max 8 model that was involved in a crash in Indonesia in October.

Calls from members of Congress to ban the Boeing 737 Max from U.S. airspace increased Tuesday, with Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) joining several Democratic lawmakers in advocating for restrictions similar to those imposed by a growing list of nations. In a tweet, Romney said the Federal Aviation Administration should ground the planes “out of an abundance of caution for the flying public” following Sunday’s Ethio­pian Airlines crash, which killed all 157 people onboard. Cruz, the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on aviation and space, said he plans to hold a hearing to investigate the crashes. He also called for the planes to be temporarily grounded “until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft and their passengers.” “Further investigation may reveal that mechanical issues were not the cause, but until that time, our first priority must be the safety of the flying public,” he said in a statement. As of late Tuesday afternoon, at least three other senators — Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), all Democrats — had called on the FAA to follow the lead of authorities in Britain, Germany, China and other nations. Warren, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, also called on Congress to hold hearings and noted that the Boeing 737 Max “is a major driver of Boeing profits.” “In the coming weeks and months, Congress should hold hearings on whether an Administration that famously refused to stand up to Saudi Arabia to protect Boeing arms sales has once again put lives at risk for the same reason,” Warren said. “But that is a question to be answered another day. Today, immediately, the FAA needs to get these planes out of the sky.” Warren was referencing the administration’s response to the death of journalist and Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in October inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. In the aftermath of his death, Trump said the United States should factor in planned arms sales to Saudi Arabia in crafting the U.S. response to the episode. Boeing is a major U.S. defense contractor. Trump has also boosted Boeing in other ways. During his recent trip to Hanoi, he posed for a photo with the company’s chief executive to celebrate a new purchase order from a Vietnamese airline that included 100 of Boeing’s 737 Max jets. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) said Tuesday that he was “very concerned” by the FAA’s decision not to ground the 737 Max and said he would be discussing the decision with the FAA administrator later in the afternoon. “We’ve seen very respected and conservative countries . . . bring all the planes down,” he said, referring to the British and European Union civil aviation authorities. “Obviously, other agencies have a very high level of concern.” DeFazio said he wanted to know more about the FAA’s decision not to require pilot retraining on the new Boeing model and suggested that the FAA could be conflicted between its role in regulating U.S. aviation and its role in promoting the industry. During a television appearance Tuesday afternoon, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was “very early in the process” of reviewing what led to the crash. “We have to review and see what actually took place,” she said on Fox News. “This is going to be a process, and we’re going to be in constant contact through the Department of the Transportation, the FAA, and make a determination at the appropriate time.” In a letter to the FAA on Monday, Feinstein also cited the crash of a Boeing 737 Max into the sea off Indonesia in October. “The two accidents killed all people onboard, resulting in a combined loss of 346 lives, including eight U.S. citizens,” she said. “This has raised legitimate questions about whether an unknown problem exists, which must be discovered and remedied as soon as possible.” In tweets Monday, Blumenthal also referenced the earlier crash as he called for the planes to be grounded in the United States. “Memo to FAA: Grounding all Boeing Max 8’s during fact-finding is your job,” he wrote. “It’s mandatory safety & common sense. Failing to protect fliers will create a crisis of confidence.” john.wagner@washpost.com felicia.sonmez@washpost.com	573	"[{""start"": 412, ""end"": 493, ""text"": ""following Sunday’s Ethio­pian Airlines crash, which killed all 157 people onboard"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 622, ""end"": 754, ""text"": ""He also called for the planes to be temporarily grounded “until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft and their passengers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1670, ""end"": 1740, ""text"": ""Today, immediately, the FAA needs to get these planes out of the sky.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3558, ""end"": 3811, ""text"": ""n a letter to the FAA on Monday, Feinstein also cited the crash of a Boeing 737 Max into the sea off Indonesia in October. “The two accidents killed all people onboard, resulting in a combined loss of 346 lives, including eight U.S. citizens,” she said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	552	2023-04-13T07:49:15.755350Z	2023-04-13T07:49:15.755420Z	194.641
Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration are nearing completion of a long-awaited software and training overhaul for the 737 Max 8 commercial jetliner’s flight control systems, both organizations confirmed Saturday. If the new changes are finalized and approved by the FAA on time, they could mark an early step toward remedying the safety concerns that have gripped the global aviation industry in recent months following deadly plane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The software and training fixes were announced by Boeing on March 11 after the FAA called for them in an official airworthiness directive. The two organizations have been developing the fixes for months but did not publicly commit to them until after a second deadly crash on March 10 involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet. “We’ve been working diligently and in close cooperation with the FAA on the software update,” a Boeing spokesman said Saturday in a statement. “We are taking a comprehensive and careful approach to design, develop and test the software that will ultimately lead to certification.” The FAA demanded the software fixes be completed “no later than April” and says it will evaluate the software fixes next week. “We expect the software fix early next week; and we will evaluate it at the time,” an FAA spokesman said Saturday. The news comes as Boeing and the FAA are facing a rare safety crisis that has shaken the confidence of international regulators. On March 10, a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed just minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 aboard. It came just months after another Boeing plane ― also a 737 Max 8 ― crashed off the coast of Indonesia, killing 189. Aircraft regulators around the world grounded the Max 8 and Max 9 jets within days. The two crashes occurred under similar circumstances. In each case, the plane veered up and down in the minutes after takeoff before turning into a fatal nose-dive. The FAA concluded on March 13 that it saw similarities between the two crashes based on recently analyzed satellite data and evidence investigators found in the wreckage in Ethiopia. Although the precise causes of the two crashes remain unknown, Boeing has faced harsh criticism from U.S. pilot groups, advocacy organizations and lawmakers over a decision to add a flight control system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, into the 737 Max 8 without notifying pilots. The MCAS is designed to account for changes to the plane’s engines. It is supposed to prevent the plane from stalling by automatically nudging its nose downward in response to information fed from the plane’s external sensors. Boeing did not detail the system in pilot training for the 737 Max, however, which pilots said left them in the dark about how to respond to potentially dangerous scenarios. The circumstances under which Boeing designed the plane and the FAA’s oversight of it are the subject of numerous lawsuits, congressional inquiries and a criminal investigation. All eyes will be on Boeing to see whether it can complete the software fixes on time and whether its new crew training will be viewed as sufficient. A Boeing spokesman said Saturday that the plane’s new flight systems will rely on more than one external sensor to measure the direction of the plane’s nose before making automatic changes, something that should satisfy an FAA requirement that aircraft systems do not base automated decisions on a single fallible sensor. The spokesman also said the new software would also prevent the plane’s automated system from pointing the nose of the plane too far downward, something that is meant to prevent the plane from overreacting to bad flight data. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that the system would include new alerts meant to tell the crew when the MCAS is triggered. And Boeing said recently that the new flight system would also be accompanied by new crew training related to the MCAS, which was viewed as a major departure from its earlier policy on the matter.	572	"[{""start"": 730, ""end"": 795, ""text"": ""second deadly crash on March 10 involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 419, ""end"": 476, ""text"": ""following deadly plane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1448, ""end"": 1824, ""text"": ""On March 10, a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed just minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 aboard.

Boeing executives sat down last November with pilots at the Allied Pilots Association’s low-slung brick headquarters in Fort Worth. Tensions were running high. One of Boeing’s new jets — hailed by the company as an even more reliable version of Boeing’s stalwart 737 — had crashed into the ocean off Indonesia shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board the flight operated by Lion Air. After the crash, Boeing issued a bulletin disclosing that this line of planes, known as the 737 Max 8, was equipped with a new type of software as part of the plane’s automated functions. Some pilots were furious that they were not told about the new software when the plane was unveiled. Dennis Tajer, a 737 captain who attended the meeting with Boeing executives, recalled, “They said, ‘Look, we didn’t include it because we have a lot of people flying on this and we didn’t want to inundate you with information.’ ” “I’m certain I did say, ‘Well that’s not acceptable,’ ” said Tajer, a leader in the association representing American Airlines pilots. A Boeing spokesman said the company disputes that any of its executives made that statement. On Wednesday, federal regulators ordered the grounding of the 737 Max 8 and a similar plane, the 737 Max 9, after another crash involving the plane, on this occasion in Ethi­o­pia on Sunday. Many other countries had already acted. In statements throughout the week, Boeing has said that safety is its top priority. But it also announced that it would take several steps to make the planes “even safer,” including updating the flight-control software as well as pilot displays, operating manuals and crew training. The company said these changes would be implemented over the coming weeks. The announcement comes after years in which Boeing had trumpeted the new plane as offering a “seamless” transition from previous models, a changeover that would not require carriers to invest in extensive retraining. And it highlights concerns from pilots and other groups about whether Boeing moved fast enough to address potential problems after the Lion Air crash. Congress, regulators and the company’s shareholders are now scrutinizing the decisions. On Wednesday, Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said he would hold hearings to study the Federal Aviation Administration’s process for approving the planes. DeFazio cited a concern that has particularly alarmed pilots, the introduction of software that was flagged in the bulletin sent out after the Lion Air crash. The software, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), can in some rare but dangerous situations override pilot control inputs unless it is switched off. This can interfere with pilots’ longtime training that pulling back on the control yoke raises a plane’s nose, putting the plane into a climb. That means that as a pilot tries to maneuver an airplane, the automated system may be counteracting that pilot’s inputs. “I’m going to investigate how they came to the conclusion that retraining was not necessary, and then obviously we’re going want to look at how foreign countries certify their pilots and retrain them,” DeFazio said. 'Nothing on the MCAS' After the Ethio­pian Airlines crash Sunday, Boeing said it would update flight-control software, provide more training, introduce “enhancements” to external sensors that measure the direction of an aircraft and make changes to how MCAS is activated. But two pilots who attended the meeting with Boeing in November after the Lion Air crash said pilots had suggested that the company take these actions at that time. “Whatever level of training they decided on [before the Lion Air crash], it resulted in an iPad course that I took for less than an hour,” Tajer, the American Airlines pilot, said. “A lot of pilots here at American did that course.” But he said the course did not cover the new MCAS system. “There was nothing on the MCAS because even American didn’t know about that. It was just about the display scenes and how the engines are a little different,” he said. Boeing did not comment on the pilots’ concerns. The same week Boeing executives met with pilots in Fort Worth, they also asked pilots at Southwest Airlines — which also owns 737 Max planes — to meet with them. They hurriedly arranged a conference room at the Reno Airport the Sunday after Thanksgiving, said Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. “At that meeting, they told us that a software update would probably be forthcoming in the near future,” Weaks said. But no update came in the following two months. Boeing did not comment on the meeting. In a statement earlier this week, Boeing said it had been working on the software enhancements for the 737 Max for the past several months in the aftermath of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610. The company said it had been working closely with the FAA on the software update and had also been soliciting feedback from airlines that operate the plane. Pilots reported concerns The concerns in meetings with Boeing executives were not the only signs that pilots had concerns about the airplane. A federal flight-safety reporting system contains about a dozen reports by pilots expressing exasperation about systems that limited their control of the 737 Max. Nearly two-thirds of the complaints were mainly flagging perceived faults with the aircraft or shortcomings and ambiguities in instruction, according to an analysis of the Aviation Safety Reporting System by The Washington Post. The Dallas Morning News first reported on the pilots’ complaints. “I think it is unconscionable that a manufacturer, the FAA, and the airlines would have pilots flying an airplane without adequately training, or even providing available resources and sufficient documentation to understand the highly complex systems that differentiate this aircraft from prior models,” one pilot wrote in November. “The fact that this airplane requires such jury rigging to fly is a red flag. Now we know the systems employed are error prone — even if the pilots aren’t sure what those systems are, what redundancies are in place, and failure modes.” Pilots expressed confusion about various features of the airplane. “I reviewed in my mind our automation setup and flight profile but can’t think of any reason the aircraft would pitch nose down so aggressively,” one pilot wrote. “How can a Captain not know what switch is meant during a preflight setup?” asked another. “Poor training and even poorer documentation; that is how.” The FAA pushed back against the idea that these pilot complaints could have assisted in identifying problems, saying they did not involve the MCAS system that has been at the heart of pilots’ concerns. “Some of the reports reference possible issues with the autopilot/autothrottle, which is a separate system from MCAS, and/or acknowledge the problems could have been due to pilot error,” it said in a statement. Boeing declined to comment on the system. Southwest, which uses the 737 Max planes, said it had received no reports of issues with the MCAS system. American Airlines said it reviewed data for more than 14,000 flights since the Lion Air crash in Indonesia and has “not seen a single anomaly related to the MCAS.” Reputational crisis In its order grounding the planes Wednesday, the FAA said it had received information from the Ethio­pian Airlines wreckage “concerning the aircraft’s configuration just after takeoff that, taken together with newly refined data from satellite-based tracking of the aircraft’s flight path, indicates some similarities” between what happened with that flight and the Lion Air flight in Indonesia. Boeing is scrambling to maintain its reputation for making safe and profitable airplanes. Chief executive Dennis A. Muilenburg called President Trump on Tuesday, the White House said, to vouch for the safety of the planes. On Wednesday, the company issued a statement saying that “out of an abundance of caution and to reassure the flying public of the aircraft’s safety,” it agreed with the FAA’s decision to ground the planes. “Boeing continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX,” the company said. Boeing designed the 737 Max to fly up to 3,850 miles, and it became a key tool in the company’s global ambitions. The Max uses engines that are both bigger and more fuel-efficient, and the new engines have been moved slightly forward on the wings compared with previous models. To compensate for the repositioning, Boeing added MCAS to replicate the handling characteristics of earlier models. In the Lion Air crash, according to a preliminary report, the 737 Max seemed to careen up and down repeatedly. Analysts said this suggested the MCAS system was redirecting the plane whenever it went into a nose-up position by pointing the nose down. In an appearance on CNBC in December, Muilenburg was asked whether the company was doing enough to ensure pilots were properly trained after the October crash. Muilenburg said that the company’s bulletin on the software helped in “directing pilots and airlines to these existing procedures” and that Boeing was “taking a look at that to make sure all the appropriate training is in place and that the communications with our customers are there.” “It’s very, very important to us, but I will say bottom line here, very important, is that the Max 737 is safe,” he said. Muilenburg’s comments came about a week after the meetings in Texas and Reno, when pilots said they heard similar promises. Sitting around pullout tables in leather-backed chairs, Tajer said, some of the company’s top engineers were apologetic. “We said ‘shame on you.’ They said, ‘I know.’ ” aaron.gregg@washpost.com jonathan.oconnell@washpost.com andrew.tran@washpost.com faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com	571	"[{""start"": 160, ""end"": 397, ""text"": ""One of Boeing’s new jets — hailed by the company as an even more reliable version of Boeing’s stalwart 737 — had crashed into the ocean off Indonesia shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board the flight operated by Lion Air."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 398, ""end"": 584, ""text"": ""After the crash, Boeing issued a bulletin disclosing that this line of planes, known as the 737 Max 8, was equipped with a new type of software as part of the plane’s automated functions"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1143, ""end"": 1334, ""text"": "".

Two heavily damaged data and voice recorders that hold key information on Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302 arrived Thursday in a Paris suburb, where an international team of investigators will try to retrieve and analyze intricate details from the Boeing 737’s onboard systems and cockpit conversations. Ethio­pian investigators delivered the mangled orange flight data recorder to specialists at France’s civil air safety investigation authority, the Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses, or BEA, which has extensive experience analyzing crashes in Europe and around the world. They also carried a cockpit voice recorder. The BEA said technical work on the devices would begin Friday. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, the United States’ independent investigative agency, as well as the Federal Aviation Administration, will add their expertise to the investigation involving the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, which was certified by FAA officials working with the American aviation giant. The same Boeing model was involved in the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air flight that plunged into the Java Sea in Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew onboard. Ethiopian Airlines chief executive Tewolde Gebremariam had said earlier this week that the boxes could go to the United States but then immediately added they would more likely be sent to Europe in the interests of proximity and speed. The boxes were initially offered to Germany, but the country’s aircraft investigators declined to analyze them, saying they came from a new type of plane and a new type of software. Ethiopia’s decision to then offer them to France came just after the visit of President Emmanuel Macron, who left Ethiopia on Tuesday. Some experts suggested that sending the devices to Europe for examination, rather than to the United States, might minimize second-guessing in the fraught investigation, given that the plane was built by a major American manufacturer that has continued to tout the safety of its aircraft. (Boeing said Thursday that it had stopped delivery of all 737 Max jets. The company said it would continue manufacturing them, however.) Similar decisions on where to send black boxes have been made in previous cases, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB investigator and FAA safety manager. Despite vast technical expertise in the United States, some “foreign countries would not opt to send to the U.S. because they were the ones who built the airplane,” Guzzetti said. “Many times foreign countries just have a good relationship with a certain other country.” After a major airline disaster such as the one Sunday, which killed 157 passengers and crew onboard, investigators rush to recover the devices. They are required on all airlines around the world and are built to withstand fire, heavy impact and intense water pressure. When planes go down in the ocean, a pinger attached to the black box sends a signal that sounds like a grandfather clock ticking for about 30 days before its battery dies. Typically, experts say, it takes almost a month to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data in the recorders. But depending on the level of damage, those looking into the crash should be able to begin analyzing the initial data within 24 to 48 hours, said Mark Millam, vice president, technical, at the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit organization that focuses on providing expert safety guidance to the aviation and aerospace industries. The data recorder’s “high-precision data” will give investigators detailed information about the actual airspeed of the aircraft, the up-and-down motion of the wings, and the up-and-down motion of the plane’s nose, Millam said. Combining that with the voice recordings is “golden in terms of any accident investigation.” According to the BEA, raw data from the recorders is decoded, turned into graphs and “used to calculate the behaviour of the aeroplane.” The audio recordings are turned into transcripts and also “make it possible to interpret warnings and noises present in the cockpit,” the agency said. The Ethio­pian Airlines devices were discovered quickly after the crash, leading some U.S. officials to hope the insights within them would help determine whether American authorities should ground the 737 Max jets. While Ethio­pian investigators have the ability to download information from black boxes, they lacked the tools to do so in this case given the extensive damage, according to the FAA. It is unclear why it took days for the devices to be given to international investigators with suitable equipment and experience. “The delay was inexcusable. . . . They should have had a decision of where they were going to go as soon as they knew the airplane crashed,” Guzzetti said. “Maybe it was because of political factors. Maybe it was because they simply didn’t know any better. Maybe it was because they were distrustful of other parties.” Using satellite tracking data from a private firm, U.S. and Canadian officials identified parallels between the flight that crashed outside Addis Ababa and the Lion Air flight in Indonesia, leading to the FAA’s decision Wednesday to ground both the 737 Max 8 and the Max 9, another aircraft in the series. The U.S. decision came after much of the world had already grounded the plane. Aviation experts said the satellite data showed the Ethio­pian Airlines plane’s movements echoed those of the Lion Air plane. Both crashes involved relatively new 737 Max 8s. The two jets both struggled to gain altitude and appeared to ascend and descend several times before crashing shortly after takeoff. But that is still only one piece of a very complex puzzle, Millam said. “I think the world will obviously want to know, were the airplanes being flown the way they were intended, the way the manuals and training systems said?” Millam said. “Investigators are also interested in whether there were any sorts of anomalies that could have produced these flight failures.” The NTSB said its three-person team has arrived in France to assist with downloading and analysis. The agency has three investigators in Ethiopia. U.S. officials say Ethio­pian authorities are taking the lead in the investigation, per international protocol, but U.S. experts have been cooperating with their counterparts from the outset. Because the 737 Max 8 was built in the United States, the NTSB can send an accredited representative to the investigation. The U.S. delegation of experts also includes technical advisers from the FAA, Boeing and GE/Safran, the manufacturer of the engines. “This is an Ethiopian investigation,” NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said. “We will be helping to download and analyze the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder” and continue the work in Ethiopia. The data in the black boxes could help investigators determine if Sunday’s crash is related to an automated feature on the aircraft, hundreds of which were flown around the world until countries, led by China, began barring them from flying in their airspace Monday. Investigators will be looking into whether the same malfunctioning sensor, coupled with an automated response from the aircraft’s software that stymied the pilots’ ability to control the Lion Air flight, contributed to the downing of the Ethiopian Airlines plane. Investigators have not determined a final cause of the Lion Air crash. In Ethiopia, the investigation continued Thursday. The NTSB investigators dispatched to France will work in coordination with those on the ground in Addis Ababa, the agency said. The NTSB group is smaller than a typical go team that would be sent to a crash on United States soil, which could consist of a dozen to 25 people. Typically, the on-site phase of a probe takes one to two weeks. “Everyone goes back home after the wreckage has been completely examined and all the perishable evidence has been gathered,” Guzzetti said. “They start poring over the data that is coming out from the flight recorders. They start doing research. They have progress meetings and teleconferences.” After investigators retrieve information from the black boxes, they will typically release some information from the cockpit recorders explaining what was happening with the airplane at the time of the crash and characterize the quality of the recording and what it might contain, Guzzetti said. But it remains unclear how state-owned Ethio­pian Airlines and the country’s civil aviation authorities will release information, which has thus far been somewhat scattershot. Black boxes have helped investigators examine many crashes and have led to significant improvements in airplane safety and pilot training. Some U.S. airlines began to use flight data recorders in the late 1950s, and the recorders quickly caught on in other countries. luz.lazo@washpost.com michael.laris@washpost.com lori.aratani@washpost.com	570	"[{""start"": 1007, ""end"": 1173, ""text"": ""The same Boeing model was involved in the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air flight that plunged into the Java Sea in Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew onboard."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4939, ""end"": 5244, ""text"": ""Using satellite tracking data from a private firm, U.S. and Canadian officials identified parallels between the flight that crashed outside Addis Ababa and the Lion Air flight in Indonesia, leading to the FAA’s decision Wednesday to ground both the 737 Max 8 and the Max 9, another aircraft in the series."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5450, ""end"": 5630, ""text"": ""Both crashes involved relatively new 737 Max 8s.

The European Union has just joined Australia and China in banning Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jetliner from their airspace, after Britain, France and Germany individually did so earlier Tuesday. This is likely to lead to greater pressure for a worldwide grounding of the aircraft. That will have big consequences for Boeing for the aviation industry, and perhaps for the U.S. economy. The ban is a response to two crashes The nations that have banned the 737 Max from their airspace are responding to Sunday’s horrific crash. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 had just left Addis Ababa for the Kenyan capital of Nairobi when it reported technical problems and requested permission to turn back. Its wreckage was found moments later on the outskirts of Africa’s political hub, near the small town of Bishoftu. Everyone on board was killed. The crash marks the second time in five months that this new type of Boeing aircraft was involved in a fatal crash. In October, another 737 Max belonging to Indonesian low-cost giant Lion Air plunged into the sea, killing 189 passengers and crew. Big money is at stake Sunday’s crash was an enormous tragedy, which killed, among others, many humanitarian workers and aid professionals. Yet there is also another dimension to the crash: money. The 737 has long been one of Boeing’s best-selling products. First introduced in 1968, thousands of these airplanes have been sold to date. The Max — a newer, more fuel-efficient version of the original 737 — is particularly important for Boeing. With global airlines expected to buy over 37,000 airplanes — valued at over $5 trillion — over the coming decades, Boeing sees the Max as key to winning the jet order arms race against its European rival, Airbus. The world’s dominant plane makers have long been locked in a tussle for market share. Sales in the Asian Pacific market are particularly important to Boeing. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), an airline trade group, the region will be the biggest driver of air travel demand over the next decade with over half of all new passenger traffic coming from countries including Indonesia and China. Since Sunday’s crash, the Max has been banned from operating in both countries. The move by Chinese authorities is particularly worrying given the country already operates one of the largest fleets of the 737 Max in the world. The Chinese air safety regulator said the move was in line with its principle of “zero tolerance of safety hazards.” Now, the swift action from the E.U., together with tweeted complaints from President Trump, may transform a regional market crisis into a global one. Regulators’ response has been mixed On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told reporters, “If the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.” Chao’s Canadian counterpart — Minister Marc Garneau — voiced similar sentiments. Garneau’s comments come as his country’s flag carrier sought to reassure nervous travelers. In a statement, Air Canada — which operates 24 of the Max jets — said, “These aircraft have performed excellently from a safety, reliability and customer satisfaction perspective.” However, one member of an influential U.S. air safety group sounded the alarm. Paul Hudson — a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee — said the agency’s “'wait and see’ attitude risks lives as well as the safety reputation of the U.S. aviation industry.” Hudson called for the immediate grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. So did Jim Hall — the former head of the National Transportation Safety Board — as did Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Monday said the planes “should be grounded until the FAA can assure American travelers that these planes are safe.” On Tuesday, other U.S. lawmakers joined the chorus, calling on the FAA to take action. It will take time to figure out what happened Crash investigators are expected to comb through the wreckage looking for clues. However, a report summarizing their findings is unlikely to be made public anytime soon. Investigations can often take months, if not years. In the meantime, back-to-back crashes of American-made airplanes may have political ramifications. For one thing, these events undercut Trump’s claims that his policies have made flying safer than ever. In a widely reported 2017 tweet, the president claimed that air safety had improved because he’d been “very strict on commercial aviation.” Defensiveness over these comments may explain why he on Tuesday complained that “airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.” If Boeing aircraft sales are suspended, there are likely to be indirect consequences for American jobs. Following October’s Lion Air crash, the airline threatened to cancel over $22 billion worth of jet orders. If airlines start to believe that there is something inherently wrong with Boeing’s prized offering — or, even worse, if consumers start to identify the new 737 models as unsafe — it will have serious ramifications for Boeing.

The muddled response by U.S. regulators and the Trump administration to the safety risks of the Boeing 737 Max is raising fresh doubt not only about the international airworthiness of a jetliner — but also of American leadership. Around the globe, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for decades represented the gold standard for air safety — a regulator whose decisions, particularly on American-made aircraft, boosted the confidence of plane travelers in New York, Miami and Los Angeles, as well as London, Rio de Janeiro and Beijing. Yet since Sunday’s Ethiopian Airlines crash shortly after takeoff — the second 737 Max to go down in less than five months — foreign observers have watched Washington’s handling of the crisis with mounting alarm. Critics at home and abroad are blaming, at best, erratic decision-making and, at worst, domestic commercial interests, for what many of them decry as a flawed U.S. reaction. “Protection of passengers is what the FAA is there for. Beyond any consideration, it’s safety, safety, safety. And traditionally, the FAA has been the best in the world,” said Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Berlin University of Technology in Germany. “But now, this has been spoiled.” After Sunday’s crash, the FAA defended the 737 Max until reversing course Wednesday, two days after China led a host of nations in grounding the jetliners. President Trump, meanwhile, fired off rambling tweets about newfangled planes before preempting his own regulators and announcing the U.S. decision to finally ground the aircraft based on new evidence that showed similarities between Sunday’s crash in Africa and that of another 737 Max crash in Indonesia in October. The outcome, critics say, has undermined American credibility as the pacesetter for global aircraft standards, while potentially ushering in an era in which international regulators — particularly those in China and Europe — assert growing clout. The global response now stands in contrast to 2013, when foreign aviation authorities largely followed the U.S. lead in dealing with a rash of battery problems that led to the temporary grounding of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This time, the FAA “just looked idiotic,” said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department. Noting that Ethiopia has decided to send black boxes recovered from Sunday’s crash to France rather than the United States for analysis, she added, “There is no way this doesn’t erode confidence in American aviation regulation and American leadership.” Giemulla said the delays in Washington have reinforced fears that the Trump administration is compromising the work of government agencies and experts in deference to the wishes of big companies such as Boeing. “It fits the impression that the world outside the U.S. has of Donald Trump,” he said. For some, the events of this week harked back to the international distrust of American financial regulators that surfaced after a toxic meltdown on Wall Street sparked the global financial crisis a decade ago. Yet it also fueled further concern over what critics call the recklessness of a Trump era driven by edicts via Twitter, impromptu trade wars and the on-again, off-again detente with North Korea. In the aftermath of the crash, global experts marveled at what they called a sudden “rebellion” in an area Washington once dominated: global aviation. “The Americans may feel, and not without justification, that they have the greatest insight into the Boeing aircraft,” said Sandy Morris, an aerospace analyst with the Jefferies financial group in London. “But this is a case when others in the world decided that they wanted to bring the risk of another accident down to zero. What you’ve seen here is a rebellion.” Perhaps nowhere was U.S. leadership on aviation safety being questioned more than in China, the first country to ground the 737 Max — an unprecedented move for a government that long followed cues from American authorities. A top Chinese regulator said his agency made its decision because the FAA and Boeing had not provided China with satisfactory answers about the airplane’s software and safety issues after the first 737 Max crash — of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia that killed all 189 passengers and crew. Li Jian, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, suggested that the FAA was reluctant to take strong measures against the 737 Max. “They have had difficulty making a decision, so we took the lead,” Li told reporters on Monday. China’s move triggered a cascade of action by other countries, including Britain, Canada and members of the European Union, which followed suit within 48 hours, effectively isolating the FAA before Trump ordered the planes temporarily grounded as well. Chinese officials probably welcomed the opportunity to establish their leadership credentials at an inflection point in the country’s aviation history, analysts said. China’s civil aviation market is expected to eclipse that of the United States in three years, while its first homegrown passenger jet, the C919 narrow-body model that is designed to compete with the 737 Max, is also expected to take to the skies by the mid-2020s, at least in China. “As China grows, as its aviation grows both as a market and manufacturer, as its products and technology develop, it’s obviously the intention of the Chinese government to take on more and more global leadership,” said Guo Yufeng, chief executive of the Q&A Consulting firm in Guangzhou. In Europe, several aviation officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the process by which jets are grounded, said they traditionally look to the FAA for guidance on U.S.-built planes. And for days, they stuck to that, opting not to take action in the face of mounting pressure to do so. As recently as Tuesday morning, regulators in some nations in Europe issued statements standing by the U.S. decision to keep the 737 Max flying. But within hours, European officials made a different determination, prompted in part by new satellite information suggesting similarities between the crash on Sunday and the Lion Air flight that went down October — evidence the United States would not act on until later in the day Wednesday. “Aviation safety is our number one priority & the EU is taking every step to ensure the safety of passengers,” wrote the top E.U. official in charge of transportation, Violeta Bulc, on Twitter. The international outcry was not universal. Few, for example, in Japan and South Korea appeared to challenge U.S. management of the crisis. But from Canada to China to the Middle East, a social media storm erupted over the erosion of American credibility. “Smart friends of mine have pointed out the reactions to 737 MAX might be inflection point for US hegemony,” tweeted Canadian scholar Stephen Saideman. “China says no to MAX, FAA says don’t worry, EU closes airspace. So much for US leadership.” In Brazil, the controversy surrounding the 737 Max even before Sunday’s crash was not so much a rejection of U.S. leadership as an attempt to function in its absence. When the Max models were first introduced, for instance, Brazil ignored an FAA decision not to require additional pilot training for the aircraft’s software, instead determining that such training was in fact needed. On March 11, India’s civil aviation regulator first announced that any pilot flying the 737 Max must have a minimum of 1,000 hours of experience and reserved the right to impose other restrictions based on information received from the FAA and Boeing. But as other countries grounded the planes entirely, India’s aviation regulator — which eventually grounded the aircraft Tuesday night — faced growing criticism for its own delayed reaction. Critics there said the fact that the FAA was even slower to react undermined its role as a decider in such crises. “We all live by their rules,” said Neelam Mathews, a veteran aviation journalist based in New Delhi. “It’s very disappointing the way the FAA reacted.” By Wednesday, the last major holdout — besides the United States — was Canada. As other countries grounded the planes, Ottawa stood with Washington. That changed Wednesday morning. With domestic pressure growing, Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau switched course, just hours ahead of Trump, citing “new evidence.” Canadian reporters pressed him on whether the United States had pressured Canada to keep the planes in the air. He said it had not. Hours later, Trump announced the United States was also grounding the planes. “We’re doing it almost as a simultaneous thing. Because we were coordinating with Canada. We were giving them information, they were giving us information, and we very much work in conjunction with Canada,” he said. anthony.faiola@washpost.com	568	"[{""start"": 542, ""end"": 664, ""text"": ""Yet since Sunday’s Ethiopian Airlines crash shortly after takeoff — the second 737 Max to go down in less than five months"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4006, ""end"": 4296, ""text"": ""A top Chinese regulator said his agency made its decision because the FAA and Boeing had not provided China with satisfactory answers about the airplane’s software and safety issues after the first 737 Max crash — of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia that killed all 189 passengers and crew."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5992, ""end"": 6205, ""text"": ""But within hours, European officials made a different determination, prompted in part by new satellite information suggesting similarities between the crash on Sunday and the Lion Air flight that went down October"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	547	2023-04-13T06:47:18.399975Z	2023-04-13T06:47:18.400040Z	723.042
Several days after an Ethio­pian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed outside Ethio­pia’s capital city, the Trump administration’s senior air safety official was still defending the plane. Acting Federal Aviation Administration chief Daniel K. Elwell, a former Air Force command pilot and American Airlines captain, was reassuring the House chairman who oversees aviation safety about the soundness of the jet, even though the same model had crashed in Indonesia four months earlier. “He still had confidence in the plane,” Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, said of the conversation early Wednesday. DeFazio said Elwell agreed to return that afternoon to address growing concerns. “Then they went dark.” Late Wednesday morning, Canada’s transportation minister announced that new satellite tracking data showed enough similarities between the October incident and the March 10 crash to ground the aircraft, following numerous other countries that had already made the decision. That left the United States as a glaring holdout. Finally, at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, word came from President Trump that the United States would also bar the planes from flying. “I didn’t want to take any chances,” Trump said. It was extraordinary for a president to intervene in matters typically left to the FAA or the Department of Transportation. Asked whether President Barack Obama was ever directly involved in a decision to ground planes or issue urgent safety mandates during his tenure, former transportation secretary Anthony Foxx said, “No, never, not one time.” In public and in private, Trump presented himself as a key arbiter in deciding whether the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes would be able to keep flying, according to White House and administration officials interviewed for this report, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal deliberations. Rather than simply being briefed on the FAA’s findings in the days after the crash, Trump played an active role, participating in phone calls with Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and other stakeholders, and offering his thoughts about the aviation industry. Asked by reporters about the decision to ground the plane, Trump left the impression that he had taken the lead, saying it was a “very tough decision.” But in the days that followed, as Trump faced criticism about whether his administration acted too slowly and whether he should have been so involved, the White House sought to direct attention back to the aviation agency. A senior White House official said the FAA had repeatedly told the president by phone that there was no reason to ground the planes and that Boeing had a record for being safe. This official said the FAA showed the president how many Boeing planes were in the sky, told him that the particular model had been flying for years, and urged against a quick grounding. An FAA spokesman declined to discuss what was communicated to the president. But agency officials offered various versions of this statement, to the public as well as others in government: “All available data . . . shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.” The disagreement offers a window into the broader dysfunction that can result when the highly technical realm of crash investigations is made political. After Trump jumped in, some of the signature features of his presidency washed over the process. The typically plodding, data-driven forensic work of figuring out what caused an airplane to fall from the sky has given way to attention-grabbing tweets, administration infighting and questions of government competence, critics said. At the same time, critics said FAA officials were more stubborn than valiant in their initial refusal to act and that they were too deferential to Boeing. “When we say we have no basis to ground the aircraft, we have no basis to ground the aircraft,” said one FAA official to The Washington Post on Tuesday, when the European Union and others were breaking with the United States and grounding the aircraft. The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the situation. “You had data. You had 350 dead bodies in four months,” countered a former FAA official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the agency’s approach. It’s a remarkable situation for the FAA — and a test of the agency’s standing at a time when commercial flight in the United States is historically safe. Joseph LoVecchio, a retired airline captain with 31 years of experience flying major carriers and jets including the Boeing 737, said the FAA’s oversight of Boeing’s training and documentation for a key automation feature was flawed. That feature has been blamed, in part, for the crash of the Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia in October. On Sunday, Ethiopia’s transportation minister said information from the flight data recorder from the Ethiopian Airlines jet shows “clear similarities” to the Lion Air flight. “Of all the years of building aircraft and certifying them, how can something like that slip through the cracks? That was a failure of leadership,” LoVecchio said. But Ray LaHood, a former GOP congressman from Illinois, who also served as a transportation secretary under Obama, emphasized that most FAA staff members are career employees focused on ensuring that the U.S. aviation system is as safe as possible. Once potential problems with the planes are fixed, “I think this will be a small little blip on the total reputation of the agency,” he said. As transportation secretary in 2013, LaHood made the decision to ground Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner after two instances in which the plane’s lithium-ion batteries caught fire. There was much internal debate at the FAA at the time, with the agency’s safety officials questioning LaHood’s decision, which took the planes out of commission for about three months. The decision to ground the Max 8 and 9 planes was made with an emergency order under Elwell’s signature. New physical evidence discovered at the crash site, “together with newly refined satellite data available to FAA this morning, led us — led me — to this decision,” Elwell told reporters shortly after Trump spoke Wednesday. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said decisions on the planes were made at the Transportation Department by “Secretary Elaine Chao, who is a very brilliant woman, working with the FAA.” Elwell, who said he was in “constant consultation” with Chao, presented the new data as a late-breaking, game-changing development that required a major reversal. U.S. officials had been telling American travelers, and those around the world, that it was safe to keep flying on the 737 Max jets, despite flight bans and growing concerns in other countries, from China to the United Kingdom. But officials were now saying that new information required the planes to be grounded immediately. Aviation experts said the satellite data showed Ethio­pian Airlines Flight 302 had ascended and descended multiple times after takeoff, echoing the behavior of the plane in the Oct. 29 Lion Air flight that crashed into the Java Sea after sensor and automation malfunctions, according to the preliminary investigation. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Elwell said the information provided crucial “missing pieces that we did not have prior to today.” But the data buttressing one of those missing pieces had actually been in the FAA’s hands since Monday, according to an FAA official and another source familiar with the details. The explanation for the delays involving the critical information are in dispute, as is the propriety of the hands-on approach Trump initially took before he began distancing himself as the week progressed. An administration official argued that the FAA had originally been dismissive of the satellite data, reflecting the agency’s strong push to defend well-connected Boeing’s safety record. But another person familiar with the circumstances denied that, saying the agency wasn’t dismissive but instead needed to translate the raw data — which is typically read by computer — into something useful. An FAA spokesman clarified the timeline, saying that after receiving the data Monday night, the FAA sought additional expertise Tuesday and “received the refined data analysis” Wednesday morning. Trump had made his own impatience with aviation technology clear in several tweets, when he opined that “airplanes are becoming far too complex” and rely on “unnecessary” technological advancements. “Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT,” he tweeted. In Trump’s unusual step of consulting directly with Muilenburg, a man he referred to in June as a “friend of mine,” the Boeing chief appealed to the president to keep the 737 Max flying. But Trump also told officials that the Boeing 737 “sucked” and wasn’t as good as the Boeing 757 he owns as a personal jet. Some experts and analysts say they are confident that the decision to ground the Boeing 737 Max was made by experts at the FAA based on the new evidence, which included a device found in the wreckage that indicated the jet was configured to dive. That finding marked another similarity with the Indonesia crash. But the way the grounding decision was rolled out was highly unusual, the experts said. “I have never seen the White House come up with an announcement like this,” said Jeff Guzzetti, who until last month was director of the FAA’s Accident Investigation Division. “They may have felt that the world’s attention was focused on this and the White House” deserved its share, Guzzetti said. “The Canadians beat them to it. It did look bad.” Trump was inclined to ground the planes in meetings early in the week but was getting sharp pushback from Muilenburg and FAA officials, who continued to deliberate as late as Wednesday morning, officials said. A person familiar with the process said Trump quizzed Elwell and Chao about why other countries were grounding the planes and the United States was not. “The answer was, ‘There’s no basis,’ ” the person said. Christopher A. Hart, the former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said he did not disagree with the FAA’s hesitance to ground the planes. Hart said the grounding of the 737 Max represented “uncharted territory” for the United States and one of its plane manufacturers. What is the threshold for grounding a plane in a scenario where automation doesn’t work as intended or pilots fail to grasp the complexities of automated systems, he wondered. “The two questions are going to be: What is the trigger for the grounding? And what is going to be the trigger for ending the grounding?” Hart said. Kudlow said “Boeing has come forward to make some adjustments in flight plans and software and sensors and pilot training and all kinds of things.” Still, he added, “They won’t be back on the runways until we are absolutely 100 percent satisfied that they are safe.” Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he had been having phone conversations with airline executives and regulators throughout the process. The White House didn’t get the satellite data until Wednesday, an administration official said. Trump had a final phone consultation with Muilenburg that day. Trump agreed to let the FAA announce the decision but then did it himself before the FAA could. “They were going to announce grounding the plane, but they told Trump they were going to do that and Trump went out and announced it before I heard from the FAA,” DeFazio said. After telling reporters the planes were being grounded “effective immediately,” Trump went off script, indicating it was not solely a safety-based decision. “We didn’t have to make this decision today. We could’ve delayed it,” Trump said. “We maybe didn’t have to make it at all, but I felt — I felt — it was important, both psychologically and a lot of other ways,” Trump said. michael.laris@washpost.com josh.dawsey@washpost.com luz.lazo@washpost.com ashley.halsey@washpost.com	567	"[{""start"": 769, ""end"": 1042, ""text"": ""Late Wednesday morning, Canada’s transportation minister announced that new satellite tracking data showed enough similarities between the October incident and the March 10 crash to ground the aircraft, following numerous other countries that had already made the decision."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4560, ""end"": 4894, ""text"": ""Joseph LoVecchio, a retired airline captain with 31 years of experience flying major carriers and jets including the Boeing 737, said the FAA’s oversight of Boeing’s training and documentation for a key automation feature was flawed.

It may be weeks or months until we know why Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed minutes after takeoff Sunday, killing all 157 passengers and crew on board — if the cause of the crash is determined at all. But the crash is drawing comparisons to another air disaster, the Oct. 29 wreck of Lion Air Flight 610, which went down off the coast of Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. On Wednesday, President Trump grounded the type of aircraft involved in both crashes — Boeing 737 Max — following the European Union and more than a dozen other nations that took action earlier in the week. The Federal Aviation Administration’s order to ground the planes states that the similarities between the two crashes “warrant further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents that needs to be better understood and addressed.” Although the Indonesian crash is still under investigation, a preliminary report released in October by local authorities offers details that are strikingly similar to the Ethiopian Airlines flight. Both incidents involved the Boeing 737 Max 8. And there are other parallels: Both aircraft crashed just minutes after takeoff; both struggled to gain altitude; and both appeared to ascend and descend several times before crashing. Both flights crashed within minutes of takeoff Lion Air Flight 610 took off from Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 6:20 a.m. Oct. 29 in clear conditions. Just 12 minutes into its journey to Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang, it crashed into the sea off the coast of Java. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 left Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at 8:38 a.m. en route to Nairobi. It lost contact with air traffic control roughly six minutes later, crashing near Bishoftu, less than 40 miles away. Thus far, there is no indication that bad weather was involved. [Read the preliminary report on the Lion Air Flight 610 crash in Indonesia] Both flights struggled to gain altitude When Lion Air Flight 610 left Jakarta, it was supposed to reach a cruising altitude of 27,000 feet, according to the preliminary report. But the aircraft struggled to gain altitude, limiting the crew’s room to gain control before the plane plummeted into the ocean at a reported 450 mph. Though there has yet to be an investigation into Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, preliminary data collected by Flightradar24 suggests that the aircraft struggled to climb at a steady speed. In both cases, pilots alerted air traffic control that there was something wrong and asked to return to the airport. Neither made it back. Both flights ascended and descended several times before nose-diving What is most striking about the Lion Air plane’s 12-minute journey is that the plane pitched downward more than two dozen times before its final plunge. Though it is not yet clear what happened aboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight, — and there may be no connection between what happened in Indonesia and Ethiopia — the aircraft also appeared to ascend and descend while accelerating, according to preliminary data from Flightradar24. In the case of the Indonesian crash, the preliminary report offers some clues as to what caused the nose of the plane to repeatedly dip. The study found that the Lion Air aircraft’s flight maintenance log showed several problems with the plane each day between Oct. 26 and Oct. 29, including errors involving air speed and altitude information displays. The preliminary report also found that some of the aircraft’s equipment was checked before its final flight but that the aircraft’s “angle of attack” sensor was not. The angle of attack sensor measures whether the plane is at risk of stalling because its nose is too high for the wings to generate enough lift at a given airspeed. A key finding was that this sensor was sending erroneous readings throughout the short flight that day, The Washington Post reported. As the aircraft made its initial ascent, the sensor insisted that the nose of the plane was too high for the plane’s airspeed, creating the risk of a stall, and an automatic feature kicked in, sending the nose downward as the pilots struggled to force it back up. “Black-box data released by Indonesian investigators showed that the pilots were pulling back on the control column, attempting to raise the plane’s nose, with almost 100 pounds of pressure before they crashed,” The Post reported. Although the preliminary report stressed that the investigation was continuing and did not assign blame for what happened, the crash raised questions about whether airlines and pilots had been trained on all the 737 Max’s software features. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency notice to all airlines that use the aircraft, warning them that faulty sensor inputs “could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,” leading to “possible impact with terrain.” Read more: With Ethiopian crash, a second new Boeing 737 Max 8 jet goes down Ethiopian Airlines flight bound for Nairobi crashes, all 157 on board killed	566	"[{""start"": 3, ""end"": 156, ""text"": ""may be weeks or months until we know why Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed minutes after takeoff Sunday, killing all 157 passengers and crew on board"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 207, ""end"": 387, ""text"": ""But the crash is drawing comparisons to another air disaster, the Oct. 29 wreck of Lion Air Flight 610, which went down off the coast of Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1130, ""end"": 1784, ""text"": ""Both aircraft crashed just minutes after takeoff; both struggled to gain altitude; and both appeared to ascend and descend several times before crashing.

Boeing executives have sought to assuage concerns of pilot groups and customers in the weeks since a new Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia, even as an investigation into the cause of the crash remains inconclusive. In an internal memo sent to employees last week, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg reiterated the safety record of the company’s 737 commercial jetliner, which he described as “a safe airplane designed, built and supported by skilled men and women who approach their work with the utmost integrity.” He pledged to continue to improve safety processes. “Regardless of the outcome, we’re going to learn from this accident and continue to improve our safety record,” Muilenburg wrote. The company is grappling with the fallout of an Oct. 29 disaster in which a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Indonesian budget airline Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. Pilot groups have said they were “kept in the dark” about an update to the plane’s automated safety system. The Boeing 737 has gone through multiple iterations and upgrades since it first flew in 1967. Its newest model is the 737 Max. When Boeing repositioned the engines on the Max and made them more powerful, it introduced a system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that was intended to make the airplane behave identical to its predecessor, the 737 Next Generation. Given that intention, Boeing told the airlines about MCAS, but pilots say it wasn’t included in their training. It remains unclear whether Lion Air’s 737 operated as Boeing expected it would. Boeing notified pilots in a Nov. 6 advisory that a manual override feature of earlier 737 models would not work on the Max 8, but Boeing representatives have not answered questions about when the company first became aware of that change. It’s also unclear why it was not addressed in pilot training. “Listening to pilots is a critical part of our work,” a Boeing spokeswoman said. “Their experienced input is front-and-center in our mind when we develop airplanes.” The 737 in the Lion Air crash had experienced a problem on the flight into Jakarta in which the displays for the pilot and the co-pilot showed different information, according to a preliminary report released this week by Indonesian investigators. That problem on the day before the fatal flight was addressed by engineers overnight, but apparently wasn’t resolved. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a bulletin to airlines that said faulty airspeed indicators could “trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds.” Though the investigation is ongoing, it appears the pilots on the doomed flight were fighting the MCAS, which interpreted faulty input from an airspeed indicator to mean the plane was in a stall from which it might not recover unless immediate action was taken. The MCAS responded by directing the nose down. “Does this mean the MCAS and other flight programs are unable to resolve discrepancies between the left and right seat flight displays, and isn’t that a terrible design flaw?” said Mary Schiavo, an aviation lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department. “The computer can’t reconcile the difference, or permit the [co-pilot] to fly normally from the right seat when there is a problem” with the pilot’s control display. A preliminary report released Wednesday by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) detailed the chaotic final minutes of the flight. According to the report, pilots fought to keep the plane level as it repeatedly steered toward the sea. It is not clear whether the pilots attempted a “runaway stabilizer” procedure that would have overridden the plane’s automated system. Black box data released by investigators showed pilots were pulling back on the control column in an attempt to raise the plane’s nose, applying almost 100 pounds of pressure to it. The report stopped short of assigning blame for the crash. A summary presented to reporters Wednesday by the NTSC noted that the report had recommended Lion Air “improve the safety culture” while also “ensuring that all operation documents are properly filled and documented.” Muilenburg referred to the crash as “a tragic accident.” He said Boeing’s employees have been “pouring significant energy into actively supporting the investigation and our MAX customers.” A Boeing spokeswoman said Thursday that the company regularly communicates with airlines and pilots but has “stepped up that engagement” in recent weeks, including “reinforcement of appropriate existing procedures” relevant to the situation investigators have described in Lion Air Flight 610. “Every day, millions of people rely on our commercial airplanes to crisscross the globe safely and reliably,” Muilenburg told employees. “When that doesn’t happen, for any reason, we take it seriously.” Pilot union representatives say they have met with Boeing technical experts about the 737 safety features. Allied Pilots Association communications committee chairman Dennis Tajer said a group of Boeing representatives, including a high-level engineer and a company test pilot, met with APA pilots at the association’s headquarters in Fort Worth on Tuesday. Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said the company held a similar meeting in Reno, Nev., on Sunday. A Boeing representative declined to comment on the meetings. “As far as I know, it was the first time that a manufacturer had reached out to SWAPA directly,” Weaks said. “We appreciated it, and we were disappointed we didn’t know about MCAS before, but at a certain point you have to move forward.” Also in the memo to employees, Muilenburg asserted that the company had not withheld information from customers. “You may have seen media reports that we intentionally withheld information about airplane functionality from our customers. That’s simply untrue,” Muilenburg wrote. “The relevant function is described in the Flight Crew Operations Manual, and we routinely engage customers about how to operate our airplanes safely.” Customers and their passengers, a Boeing spokeswoman said, “have our assurance that the 737 Max is as safe as any airplane that has ever flown the skies.”	565	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 231, ""text"": ""Boeing executives have sought to assuage concerns of pilot groups and customers in the weeks since a new Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia, even as an investigation into the cause of the crash remains inconclusive"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 722, ""end"": 956, ""text"": ""The company is grappling with the fallout of an Oct. 29 disaster in which a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Indonesian budget airline Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1192, ""end"": 1566, ""text"": ""When Boeing repositioned the engines on the Max and made them more powerful, it introduced a system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that was intended to make the airplane behave identical to its predecessor, the 737 Next Generation.
