Self-driving cars. Self-serve gas pumps. Self-checkout supermarkets. Add self-banking to that list. No people. No tellers. Nobody greeting you with “How is your day going?” Although, that may come from a machine — and sooner than you think. Bank of America has opened three mini-bank branches­ since the new year that have ATMs and video­conferencing but no people. Two opened in Denver and one in Minneapolis. In addition to the ATMs, the new robo-banks — called automated centers — allow customers to make a video­conference call to a Bank of America employee at another location to discuss more complicated money issues. “This is the beginning of the end of the American bank branch,” said Peter Fitzgerald, a former U.S. senator from Illinois, lifelong banker and founder of Chain Bridge Bank in McLean, Va. “Bank branches are dead. They were killed by the iPhone. It’s like the horseshoe when the automobile came along.” According to figures compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and supplied by the American Bankers Association, the number of U.S. bank employees has remained relatively stable. There were 2,110,276 employees in 2012, and 2,043,480 last year. But the number of U.S. bank branches has declined precipitously from a peak of 99,540 in 2009 to 91,861 in the third quarter of 2016, according to the ABA. Bank of America spokeswoman Anne Pace said live banking isn’t disappearing. About 1 million people a day walk into one of Bank of America’s 4,597 locations and interact with bank employees. But the number of locations is down from 5,900 six years ago. The company has 16,000 automated teller machines. The robo-bank customers “can have a one-on-one conversation to get a mortgage, plan for retirement, open a small business or get a car loan,” she said. “This is just a test. We haven’t rolled these out extensively. We are going to see how these go, see what we learn and make a decision from there.” Pace said the new banks are not replacing existing locations. She also said Bank of America is adding 50 to 60 traditional centers. Word of the new robo-banks leaked out at a Credit Suisse conference in Miami on Tuesday during a question-and-answer session with Dean Athanasia of Bank of America’s consumer banking unit. There are no layoffs accompanying Bank of America’s robo-banks, but the new branches are part of a revolution in U.S. banking in the past few years as companies seek to save money by reducing the number of branches — and tellers and managers. Banks also are attempting to stay current with technology, which is moving toward handheld devices. “Cash is dying out,” Fitzgerald said. “Many millennials don’t carry cash. They only use their debit card. In 2011 and 2012, bank branch traffic dropped precipitously. The last I checked, 98.5 percent of our bank’s transactions are done online and electronically.” Robo-banking is also part of Bank of America’s strategy to expand its presence into harder-to-reach areas. At a fraction of the size of its traditional branches, the robo-banks save on real estate as well as personnel. Bank of America’s traditional branches run about 5,000 square feet. The robo-banks are about a quarter of that size. “There is no one-size-bank-fits-all anymore,” Pace said. “We have different centers based on different communities. We are taking some of that savings from mobile banking and reinvesting it into new centers, renovating others and hiring more specialists to provide advice and guidance to clients.” But the days of the local teller hanging around to make change or cash checks have been replaced by technology designed to service more robust profit­making centers such as credit cards, mortgages and even retirement advice. “We are simply following our clients,” Pace said. “Mobile banking users increased to 21.6 million, and 19 percent of deposit transactions are done through mobile. That’s equivalent to 880 financial centers. We need to be there whether it’s through the mobile phone or inside a financial center.” Bank of America is working on voice recognition technology called Erica (as in Bank of Am-ERICA) that will allow people to do virtual banking by voice with a computer, much as people use Amazon Alexa to order books or Apple’s Siri to ask questions on an iPhone. The bank’s Merrill Edge investment service is also allowing customers to use a robo-advised platform to invest without speaking with a human.

There is a policy at Capital One Labs in Clarendon that if a team needs more than two pizzas for dinner, the group is probably too big. Staying small has been a top priority for the two-and-a-half-year-old technology incubator, a spinoff of the McLean based financial giant. Unlike its much larger parent company, Capital One Financial, the Labs operates much like a start-up — albeit a well-funded one — in an Arlington office dotted with beanbag chairs, throw pillows and an arcade machine built by employees. Keeping teams small allows Capital One Labs to be nimble and move quickly. The company’s recent mobile wallet was born out of Capital One Labs, as was its recent partnership with Apple Pay. About 50 employees work on a dozen projects at any given time. Across the region, banks and credit unions are reinventing themselves as quasi-technology companies, coming up with new branch prototypes, payment systems and security protocols. With cybersecurity breaches becoming a major concern that costs the industry hundreds of millions of dollars, local executives say the need to keep up with the latest technology has become not only important, but vital. PNC this year opened new “universal branches” in Rosslyn and Tenleytown, where teller lines have been replaced by tablet-toting employees. Wells Fargo, which is experimenting with applications for Google Glass, has taken similar measures, picking the District for its first high-tech locations. Even smaller community banks are taking note: At Eagle Bank in Bethesda, the technology team has quadrupled since the bank’s opening in 1998. “The whole philosophy around technology has changed dramatically in the last 10 years,” said Susan G. Riel, chief operating officer for Eagle Bank. “At one time, banks controlled what technology people used, whether it was ATMs or credit cards. In today’s world, the customers are the ones telling us what they want.” Increasingly, what customers want is easy access from their phones. At Capital One Labs, tucked away on the eighth floor of an office building above a Trader Joe’s, employees clad in jeans and sneakers have spent the better part of 2014 developing the company’s mobile wallet, which offers real-time purchase information and rewards balances, and integrating the bank’s credit and debit cards with Apple Pay, a payment system that allows customers to pay for purchases using their iPhones and Apple Watches. Capital One created the Labs spinoff in early 2011 and opened its Arlington location a year later. (There are also offices in San Francisco and in New York.) The idea, executives said, is to create an in-house incubator for new technology that can be fed directly to the parent company. “At Capital One, we’re embedding technology, data and software development deeply into our business model and how we work,” Richard D. Fairbank, founder, chairman and chief executive of the company said in a call with investors two weeks ago. “Banking inherently is a digital product, and digital will transform banking over time.” In 2012, Capital One paid $9 billion for online bank ING Direct as part of its efforts to beef up its Internet presence. The company continues to add engineers, product developers, designers and data scientists, and earlier this month, it acquired Adaptive Path, a San Francisco design consulting firm. “The momentum around digital is building across financial services,” Fairbank said. “Ultimately, the winners in banking will have the capability of a world-class software company.” Emphasis on mobile banking Need a credit card? Well, Navy Federal Credit Union has an app for that. Two and a half years ago, the Vienna-based credit union scrapped its third-party mobile apps and decided to start anew. It moved its mobile technology team in-house and began designing what its customers seemed to be looking for: Apps that would allow them to apply for credit and debit cards, redeem cash rewards and see real-time updates using their phones and tablets. It seems to be working: More than 30 percent of the credit union’s members now use its mobile apps on a monthly basis, with the average person logging into their account 19 times each month. “Mobile has become the easiest way to interact with us,” said Randy Hopper, vice president of credit cards for Navy Federal Credit Union. “The results have been pretty astronomical.” At Bank of Georgetown, which began offering mobile banking earlier this year, much of the company’s technology operations are handled by third-party contractors, a necessity for a bank of its size with about $1 billion in assets, executives said. “It’s the only way we can compete with the big guys,” said Domingo Rodriguez, chief financial officer and executive vice president for the District-based bank. “Emphasis number one is on data security. It’s our house and we want to protect it the best we can.” About 5 percent of the company’s gross revenue goes toward technology, he said, adding that cybersecurity has become one of the bank’s most pressing concerns in recent years given the number of high-profile data breaches, most recently at JPMorgan Chase. Last year’s data breach at Target cost American banks and credit unions more than $200 million, according to the Consumer Bankers Association and the Credit Union National Association. “In today’s world, everyone is getting attacked,” said Riel of Eagle Bank, adding that while Eagle has not had a data breach, it has been attacked. Eagle Bank is in the process of allowing business customers to approve wire transfers using mobile devices. The technology is easily accessible, Riel said, but the challenge is making sure that the transactions are secure. “It’s a scary time, but technology continues to advance,” she said. “The security is improving also — it’s just a matter of keeping up with that.” Reimagining bank branches There are two types of customers, said Wayne Fortune, manager of PNC Bank’s Tenleytown branch: Those who balance their checkbooks, and those who don’t. The first group tends to visit the bank regularly to deposit checks or withdraw cash. The latter relies on apps, real-time alerts and mobile statements to keep track of their finances. “They are polar opposites, and we have to be able to accommodate both,” Fortune said. To that end, the branch — which dates back to 1958 when it was part of Riggs Bank — reopened in late September after more than a year of renovations. The space was gutted. Teller lines, glass barriers and offices were replaced with stations outfitted with iPads and computers where customers can check balances and deposit checks. The branch has six employees, all of whom are trained to help customers with everything from deposits to loan applications. They walk around and offer help. A corner office is reserved for meeting with business banking and wealth management clients. “The banking industry sees value in moving toward a more universal style,” Fortune said. “We don’t have tellers and bankers. Everybody is cross-trained to do everything.” A souped-up ATM at the front of the store is also equipped for multitasking. In addition to traditional withdrawals, customers can deposit up to 50 bills of currency and 30 paper checks at a time. That machine alone has helped cut back on costs, Fortune said. Employees used to have to unlock ATMs every evening to empty envelopes, count bills and match checks. Now much of that is done digitally and in real-time. Workers tend to the machine once a week instead of every night. “As customers visit branches less to conduct a transaction and more to get advice, that requires us to rethink the layout, the format and how we manage our branches,” said Thomas S. Kunz, director of digital for PNC. Cutting costs That shift also means banks have been steadily shuttering physical locations in recent years to cut costs. As of June 30, there were 1,717 bank branches in the Washington area, 3.5 percent less than there were four years ago, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Wells Fargo, however, has added 11 branches since 2010 as the San Francisco-based bank has shifted its focus toward smaller, high-tech branches in urban neighborhoods such as NoMa and the U Street Corridor. The company’s newest locations use touch-screens instead of deposit slips. Going digital has helped cut costs and made operations more efficient — there are fewer documents to sort and shred at the end of the day — and has also helped cut down on back-office storage space. “If you look at the banking industry broadly, there’s still a lot of paper that drives that business,” said Jonathan G. Velline, executive vice president for ATM banking and store strategy at Wells Fargo. “For us, we know that is inefficient and we also know that our customers don’t want to fill out all of that paperwork. They expect the immediate gratification they’ve come to expect from Amazon or Google or Samsung.” The company’s new stores devote about 10 percent of their overall footprint to storing documents, compared to 40 percent for a traditional branch, Velline said. For community banks, the shift toward smaller — and fewer — branches has an added benefit: Being able to reach a broader swath of customers without spending large amounts of money on new real estate. At Eagle Bank, for example, an increasing number of the bank’s customers live outside of Washington. The ability to check account balances and bank activity with the tap of a button has been transformative, Riel said. “We always say we listen to our customers, but with technology, we really have to,” she said. “They’re the ones driving change, not us.

As the world’s largest credit union, Navy Federal has nearly 250 branches and, as of last month, 5 million members. Now it’s about to get even bigger. To keep up with growing membership, which has risen 25 percent since 2012, the credit union is opening 60 new branches across the country by 2016. In the Washington area, the Vienna-based credit union plans to add about a dozen locations in the next two years. Growth “is faster than it has been in the past,” said Steve Romano, executive vice president of branch operations for Navy Federal. “Our members like to use our branches, and they’re asking for more.” In addition to an upcoming location in Frederick, Navy Federal also has plans to open branches in Crofton, Waldorf, Bowie and Gaithersburg in 2015. “Branches are focused where we have the most concentration of members and where we’re seeing growth,” Romano said, adding that demand is up in the Washington region, as well as Tidewater, Va.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and San Diego. The credit union’s expansion comes at a time when most financial institutions are shuttering physical locations to save costs. Plus, they say, customers are increasingly likely to deposit a check via smartphone or ATM without stepping foot into a bank. But at Navy Federal, Romano says demand for branches — which sometimes offer notary and power of attorney services at military bases — has been on the rise. This month, the credit union opened its first “technology concept branch” in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard, marking its 32nd area location. Instead of traditional teller lines, the 3,300-square-foot branch offers a more interactive experience, Romano said. There are iPads and smartphones on hand to show members how to use the credit union’s mobile apps to make deposits, transfer money and check balances. A kids’ area includes electronic games about financial literacy. “This is more personal than your typical branch,” Romano said. “There is a very comfortable wooden desk where members can sit down with an iPad or an Android if they want to.” The credit union’s newest members are typically between the ages of 18 and 34, Romano said, adding that they are interested in learning how to use new banking technology. “When you join, we want to show you all of the different capabilities we have,” Romano said. “It’s sort of like when you buy a car and the [salesman] drives it around the neighborhood and shows you all the features.” As of March 2014, Navy Federal had $58.16 billion in asserts, a 7 percent increase from the year before. Membership is open to U.S. military personnel and their families, as well as Defense Department employees.	308	26	316	2023-03-29T07:58:01.739998Z	2023-03-29T07:58:01.740080Z	138.62	"[{""start"": 989, ""end"": 1115, ""text"": ""he credit union’s expansion comes at a time when most financial institutions are shuttering physical locations to save costs."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
Andrews Federal Credit Union has three branches in Maryland and one in the District. But thanks to a network of shared credit union sites, members can go to any of more than 4,600 branches around the world to deposit checks, pay off loans or withdraw money. “You may not find a building with your credit union’s awning on it, but you can still do all sorts of transactions,” said Fred Becker, president and chief executive of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. Area credit unions are increasingly turning to branch sharing following Bank Transfer Day — an initiative that encouraged consumers to move their money from large banks to credit unions last November. “We’ve seen an influx of deposits coming in since last year, and we continue to see that build up across all credit unions,” said Craig Beach, president and chief operating officer of Co-Op Shared Branching, which oversees a shared network for 3,000 credit unions. In the first six months of this year, the Co-Op network added 301 branch locations, a 36 percent increase from last year. Taken together, the shared credit union outlets make up the fourth-largest branching network in the country, behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Chase, Beach said. “We want all credit union members to have a large network where they can do their banking,” said Linda Garboczi, vice president of marketing at Andrews FCU, which began allowing members of other credit unions to begin using its facilities last month. “The face-to-face transaction just makes life more convenient.” There are currently 74 credit unions in Virginia, 17 in Maryland and 22 in the District that participate in shared branching. Many said it was an obvious decision. “From a credit union perspective, we just didn’t have the capital to put all these branches all over town like the banks do,” said Doug Drury, chief financial officer of Market USA Federal Credit Union, which has two branches in Maryland. “Now the majority of our members use shared branching.”	307	26	315	2023-03-29T07:55:41.470572Z	2023-03-29T07:55:41.470665Z	146.133	"[{""start"": 477, ""end"": 677, ""text"": ""Area credit unions are increasingly turning to branch sharing following Bank Transfer Day — an initiative that encouraged consumers to move their money from large banks to credit unions last November."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 477, ""end"": 677, ""text"": ""a credit unions are increasingly turning to branch sharing following Bank Transfer Day — an initiative that encouraged consumers to move their money from large banks to credit unions last November."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
A growing number of small and medium-sized banks are merging as shrinking profit margins, tepid loan demand and low interest rates place pressure on their operations. Conditions are unlikely to improve as the Federal Reserve contemplates another round of stimulus that could push rates even lower. Community banks also are contending with the added cost of complying with new regulations stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Industry watchers say all of these factors will spur buying activity in the coming quarters. On Monday, M&T Bank, with $81 billion in assets, became the latest bank buyer, with a $3.7 billion deal to acquire Hudson City Bancorp, a $43.6 billion community bank in Paramus, N.J. The transaction, the largest bank merger this year, is slated to close in the second quarter of 2013, subject to regulatory approval. Buffalo, N.Y.-based M&T will gain an additional $25 billion in deposits, $28 billion in loans and 135 branches. Once the acquisition is completed, the bank will boast 870 branches stretching from upstate New York to Virginia. M&T has actively pursued deals coming out of the recession. The bank last year picked up Wilmington Trust Corp. for more than $400 million to expand its wealth management services, one of the most lucrative segments of the industry. In 2008, M&T purchased Baltimore-based Provident Bankshares for $401 million. Despite emerging from the financial crisis relatively unscathed, Hudson City has watched profits wane in the face of record- low interest rates. Acting chief executive Denis Salamone earlier this year said the interest rate environment was making it difficult for Hudson to profitably grow its business. By lowering long-term interest rates, while keeping short-term rates low, the Fed effectively squeezed the spread that banks such as Hudson depend on to make money, said banking analyst Terry McEnvoy of Oppenheimer & Co. He said a prolonged period of paltry profits, coupled with rising regulatory expenses, has made mergers more palatable to regional and community banks. “Banking is becoming more and more about economies of scale to overcome the challenges posed to profitability from financial reform,” McEnvoy said. Whereas large national banks have little trouble hiring more accountants and lawyers to manage compliance with new regulations, community banks find it difficult to absorb those costs. Banking analyst Bert Ely said Dodd-Frank legislation places the heaviest burden on banks with less than $500 million in assets, which will likely be the primary source of deal activity. Small banks, he said, will be especially taxed by new requirements to keep 5 percent of the loans they issue through mortgage-back securities on their books. He also thinks smaller banks will be discouraged by higher and stricter capital requirements. “People decry the growth of big banks, but that’s exactly where regulation is pushing things,” Ely said. “It’s going to lead to a much more concentrated and ultimately less competitive banking industry.” There have been 108 bank deals in 2012 announced through August, compared with 72 deals for the same period a year earlier, according to Oppenheimer. Community banks in the Washington area have been active buyers. In June, Fairfax-based First Virginia Community Bank announced a $3.7 million deal to acquire Arlington’s 1st Commonwealth Bank. A month earlier, Reston-based WashingtonFirst Bank agreed to buy Alliance Bank of Chantilly for $24.4 million. Kip Weissman, partner with the law firm Luse Gorman Pomerenk & Schick, said banks with more than $50 billion in assets are generally staying out of the market because of merger-and-acquisitions limits imposed by Dodd-Frank. The law requires the Federal Reserve to block deals where the risk outweighs the benefits of the transaction to avoid creating more institutions that are “too big to fail.” “A lot of banks in the $40 billion area are also going to be reluctant to pull the trigger on a deal that would get them above $50 billion, as they are trying to avoid being classified as systemically risky,” said Weissman, who has engineered a number of bank acquisitions. “A lot of the action will come from the smaller guys.”	306	26	314	2023-03-29T07:53:13.176198Z	2023-03-29T07:53:13.176277Z	544.276	"[{""start"": 1532, ""end"": 1689, ""text"": ""Acting chief executive Denis Salamone earlier this year said the interest rate environment was making it difficult for Hudson to profitably grow its business"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1691, ""end"": 1910, ""text"": ""By lowering long-term interest rates, while keeping short-term rates low, the Fed effectively squeezed the spread that banks such as Hudson depend on to make money, said banking analyst Terry McEnvoy of Oppenheimer & Co"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2397, ""end"": 2581, ""text"": ""Banking analyst Bert Ely said Dodd-Frank legislation places the heaviest burden on banks with less than $500 million in assets, which will likely be the primary source of deal activity"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2583, ""end"": 2833, ""text"": ""mall banks, he said, will be especially taxed by new requirements to keep 5 percent of the loans they issue through mortgage-back securities on their books.

Wall Street banks are in a bit of a holding pattern. The once booming mortgage market has fizzled. Trading bonds and other securities is not as profitable as it used to be. And there are few avenues for business expansion. Yet some of the biggest drags on bank balance sheets, including troubled loans and high litigation expenses, have eased at most firms. Still, based on third-quarter results from more than a dozen banks, it appears that the industry has entered a period of stagnation. “We’re stuck in neutral,” said Nancy Bush, contributing analyst for SNL Financial. “Nobody has massively disappointed. The pieces­ are just not in place yet for a great renaissance in bank earnings.” The good news, said banking analyst Mike Mayo of CSLA, is banks have “improved costs, credit and capital so that the industry is much safer than it was a few years ago.” The downside is that “revenue growth this decade is on pace to be the worst it’s been since the decade of the Great Depression.” For several quarters, bank earnings have been fueled by homeowners refinancing their mortgages. That business leveled off during the spring as interest rates crept up amid speculation that the Federal Reserve would taper its stimulus program. The central bank’s monthly bond purchases have tamped down interest rates to the benefit of banks, which welcomed a flood of homeowners eager to take advantage of lower rates. Industry analysts anticipated the boom to taper off this year as the number of loans eligible for interest rate reductions dropped. Among 15 of the banks that have reported earnings to date, originations were down 16 percent on average, according to Barclays Capital. All of the firms reported lower refinance volume and relatively flat purchase activity. Researchers at Barclays said applications and loans in the pipeline are down around 40 percent from where they were a year ago. Wells Fargo, which handles about a third of the mortgage market, received $87 billion worth of mortgage applications last quarter, compared with $188 billion a year ago. Mortgage banking income also tumbled 43 percent. “We’re in a transitional period in our mortgage business,” Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan told analysts on a call. “We’ve managed through many refi cycles in the past and remain committed to the mortgage business.” Banks have responded to the decline in business with rounds of layoffs in their home loan units. Wells Fargo sent pink slips to 5,300 employees in its home loan division in the third quarter, while JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s second-largest mortgage lender, let go about 3,000 workers in its unit. “We’re experiencing moderate economic growth and one of the downsides of that for a lender is the refinance business goes away pretty fast,” said Michael Fratantoni, vice president of research and economics at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group. Fratantoni expects the mortgage industry will achieve about $1.7 trillion in loan origination volume in 2013, compared to $2 trillion a year ago. He is confident that the purchase of new homes will increase about 10 percent this year. But the pickup in new home lending, he said, will not compensate for the drop in refinancing activity. As the mortgage slowdown takes hold, there are some bright spots in other types of lending. Demand for auto loans and commercial real estate loans bolstered Wells Fargo’s overall loan portfolio, which grew 4 percent to $812.3 billion in the third quarter. Another sign of strength within the industry is the decline in troubled loans. On average, the amount of money that banks set aside to cover losses on loans is down 30 percent from the previous year, an indication that the quality of the assets has improved, according to Barclays. “It’s surprising that credit quality has improved as much as it has and as long as it has, but sooner or later that will come to an end,” said Bush of SNL Financial. “We need to get some lift in this economy where people actually want to borrow money. That’s the thing missing.” At investment banks, a slump in fixed-income trading — transactions involving bonds — took a bite out of revenue at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup. Fixed-income revenue tumbled 16 percent at JPMorgan, 17 percent at Citigroup and 49 percent at Goldman. Uncertainty about monetary policy and the federal budget morass made institutional asset managers skittish about trading, analysts say. “The level of risk-taking has been reduced,” said Mayo of CSLA. “And the question is: Has the degree of risk-taking been reduced so much as to not facilitate the economy the way a banking system should?” After years of trudging through litigation rooted in the financial crisis, a number of banks reported a reduction in the amount of money they hold to cover legal costs. Bank of America, which contended with a mountain of liabilities tied to its 2008 purchase of Countrywide Financial, reported a decline from $1.6 billion to about $1 billion in litigation expenses for the quarter. The bank has spent more than $40 billion on legal costs since 2010. “We’ve tried to be out front and get through some of the larger settlements that we have, and we think that $40 billion-plus number reflects that,” Bruce Thompson, Bank of America’s chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts. JPMorgan, however, continues to grabble with massive legal costs. The bank poured $9.2 billion into its litigation coffers for the quarter, which resulted in a net loss of $980 million — the bank’s first loss in nearly a decade.	305	26	313	2023-03-28T15:51:35.040325Z	2023-03-28T15:51:35.040388Z	635.928	"[{""start"": 5, ""end"": 221, ""text"": ""reet banks are in a bit of a holding pattern.

"Capital Savings Bank opened shop in Washington in 1888, making it the nation's first black-owned bank at a time when the mere notion of offering financial services to the African American community was a novel idea. Now black-run banks are in a fight for survival, even though many advocates argue that many African Americans remain starved for banking services. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. counted 25 black-owned banks remaining in the country last year, down from 48 in 2001. That decrease came even as the overall number of minority-owned banks increased slightly, going from 164 to 174. In addition, the majority of black-owned banks that remain open are on shaky ground and struggling to hold on in the face of the economic devastation that has ravaged many of their customers. Analysts say 60 percent of black-run banks lost money in 2013. ""I would venture to say that [the vast majority of black banks] are in varying degrees of trouble,"" said Darrell Jackson, chief executive and president of Chicago's Seaway Bank, a black-owned bank celebrating its 50th anniversary. Black-run banks have been struggling for years, as mainstream institutions increasingly picked off their best-heeled customers. The increased competition came amid what some call a string of strategic blunders.The banks, historically headquartered in the heart of traditional black communities such as Chicago's South Side, New York's Harlem and Washington, D.C.'s Shaw, failed to modernize their services. Few offered the branch networks, computerized banking and other automated services that have come to dominate the business. And many of the banks failed to follow the African American middle class to the suburbs. Taken together, black banks control just $5 billion in assets, a tiny fraction of the size of the nation's banking behemoths, such as Wells Fargo, which by itself has some $1.7 trillion in assets. Black banks tend to be small even by the standard of minority owned banks, which as a group had some $181 billion in assets at the end of 2013, according a FDIC report. The economic shock continues to ripple through the black community, upending black business and even churches, which historically have been the best customers for black banks. Meanwhile, many black-owned banks are left with a lot of toxic loans in their portfolios. ""This is such an extremely important sector of the banking community,"" said Michael A. Grant, president of the National Bankers Association, the lobbying group for black banks. ""We were hit so hard during this sub-prime crisis, and they are having a hard time working their way back from that."" Others argue that many black-run banks planted the seeds for their own demise by failing to evolve with the times. William Michael Cunningham, an economist and entrepreneur, said many black banks do not do enough to modernize their businesses, and instead rely too heavily on political connections and old business alliances for deposits and customers. ""Being a black banker in a top-30 city in the U.S. is a very good job, mainly because you don't have to do much,"" Cunningham said. ""Too often, if you are a black banker, your incentive is not to make loans."" Paul O'Connor, founder of Angkor Strategic Advisors, a Chicago-based banking consultancy, called black-run banks a victim of the larger progress of African Americans. Like other institutions that thrived in the face of rampant discrimination, black banks now confront more and better financed competition for relatively affluent customers. Meanwhile, few banks see profits in banking the poor. At the same time, he noted, many black communities — particularly impoverished neighborhoods in which black-owned banks tend to be headquartered — remain in dire need of better banking options. ""The positive side of this is that the African American community has developed in a way that they don't need African American banks like they did 50 or 70 years ago,"" he said. ""Also, they have a margin for error that is much smaller than most banks. At the end of the day, you are banking human beings and they are as good a credit risk as the last job they had. A lot of people these institutions banked are hurt economically."" Whatever the root cause of the problems of  the problems of black banks, many analysts agree their demise  is a net loss, since they  disproportionately serve  poor communities where  banks are few, according to the FDIC.""Often, black banks are the only bank, ore one of two, in the entire zip code,"" said Russell Kashian, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater. ""If they weren't there, there would be nothing."" Given that reality, many advocates say their survival should be a priority of both the government and the black community. Black bankers have been lobbying federal officials to relax regulations in a way that would make it less costly to do business. Others say there need to be better incentives and training and mentoring to help sustain the banks. ""If we want these underserved neighborhoods served, either we have to make these communities wealthier, or provide some better incentives for these banks to exist,"" Kashian said. The National Bankers Association's Grant added that more black consumers should make a priority of banking with institutions that served their communities when others would not. ""The African American community itself is going to have to do more to support its businesses, which includes the banks,"" Grant said. ""Why are we boycotting our own businesses? These are the banks that were there for us before integration. We should be there for them now."""	304	26	312	2023-03-28T15:40:55.195274Z	2023-03-28T15:40:55.195358Z	611.481	"[{""start"": 1085, ""end"": 1212, ""text"": ""Black-run banks have been struggling for years, as mainstream institutions increasingly picked off their best-heeled customers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1213, ""end"": 1703, ""text"": ""The increased competition came amid what some call a string of strategic blunders.The banks, historically headquartered in the heart of traditional black communities such as Chicago's South Side, New York's Harlem and Washington, D.C.'s Shaw, failed to modernize their services.

Add banks to the list of retailers adjusting their brick-and-mortar strategies to adapt to the new times. Some predicted bank branches would be among the first to be displaced in a digital age. And while recent research by Accenture found that one-in-four customers would consider patronizing a branchless digital bank, many bank customers still value the store. In fact, 66 percent of customers still prefer to “talk to a person” rather than purchase a banking product online according to Accenture’s survey. Even with online banking becoming more convenient and easier for customers, branches still remain the pre-eminent sales channel and will for some time, according to Accenture, which found that nearly 60 percent of traditional bank products are sold through banks’ branch networks, which helps explain why the 25 largest retail banks spend more than $50 billion annually to maintain more than 43,000 branches across the nation. One noticeable change is that bank branches are getting smaller. A recent analysis of average space leased by banks in the Washington region found banks are leasing an average of 4,000 square feet, down from an average of approximately 6,500 square feet before the recession. Like other retailers, banks are making changes to their stores, replacing traditional teller-based services with more consultative ones. Banks are also starting to open up more micro-branches. Meanwhile, the trend of formerly Internet-only based companies expanding into a brick-and-mortar presence continues. This November, Rent the Runway will open its first standalone store in the Washington area at 3336 M St. NW. Bonobos, another clothing retailer located in Georgetown, doesn’t actually sell anything in their stores. They have a try-before-you-buy model that other retailers such as Warby Parker and Gap’s Piperlime have also adopted. As the changing size and role of bank branches demonstrates, as well as the long lines of shoppers lining up every time Apple releases a new product, it is becoming increasingly more evident that there can be a successful marriage of e-commerce and brick and mortar.

"Americans are less happy with their banks in 2014 than in previous years, marking a dip in what looked like an upward trend in customer satisfaction with the industry. And they're even more fed up with their health insurers, whose scores from customers in the American Customer Satisfaction Index have sunk to a 10-year low. The ACSI, one of the broadest measurements of customer experiences, released its report Tuesday on the finance and insurance sectors, based on input from roughly 6,800 Americans about more than 230 companies. For several of the industries involved, the news isn't good. Customer satisfaction scores for retail banks dropped 2.6 percent, nearly reversing two years of improvement. Overall happiness with health insurers fell for the first time in three years, dropping 4.1 percent to an industry score that's only a notch above America's most-reviled industries: airlines, cable companies and Internet service providers. Meanwhile, dissatisfaction with higher premiums led to lower scores for other insurers, such as life, home and auto insurance providers. Americans are much happier, meanwhile, with their credit unions, which held steady with the second highest industry score of all. And fueled by a booming stock market, satisfaction with online brokerages ticked upward, with scores rising 2.5 percent in 2014. And yet, the research found a growing unease with banks. According to the report, this was partly due to less competitive interest rates and harder-to-find branches and ATMs. Leaders in these industries might also want to work on how quickly financial transactions are completed, how courteous and helpful their staff are with customers, and how easy it is to understand information and make changes to accounts — all factors that got poorer scores this year. The dip in customer satisfaction also coincides with a rise in fees, said ACSI Director David VanAmburg, particularly among smaller banks, where scores fell the most. The ACSI measures customer satisfaction by asking about both the quality of the service a customer receives and the value they believe they're getting. Fees are playing both a direct and indirect role in shaping those impressions, VanAmburg said. On the one hand, customers are unhappy with banks that make them pay fees. On the other, banks that charge fewer fees often do so by cutting into service levels, which also yields unhappy customers. ""As banks try to get fees and aren't successful at doing so, they have to cut costs — reducing the number of branches, downsizing staff — which results in lower satisfaction scores,"" VanAmburg said. Even with a significant drop in their scores, regional and smaller banks still did better than all of their big national peers. Among the four largest banks, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were tied for the highest score, Wells Fargo came in second and Bank of America last. With the exception of JPMorgan Chase, whose score dipped three percent from 2013, the banks' scores held steady from the year before. An e-mail to JPMorgan Chase about the drop was not immediately returned. A Bank of America spokesman said that ACSI's data showed it was making progress in some categories, ""but we know we still have some work left to do."" Health insurers, meanwhile, saw their lowest score since 2005. They have never done well in the index — the complexity, frequent use of claims processes and high costs of health insurance have long made them part of an industry consumers love to hate. Yet among the major health insurers studied, UnitedHealth was on top, seeing a three percent gain from the year before. Aetna received the lowest score, with a six percent drop in its customer satisfaction figure from 2013. (Aetna was not immediately able to respond to the report.) ACSI attributed this to higher costs and limited choice for group plans. While the effect of the Affordable Care Act on customer satisfaction is unclear, VanAmburg said it's possible all the recent attention given to health insurance in the wake of the Affordable Care Act could be playing a role in customers' increasingly negative views. ""It's just a constant noise, a constant buzz, that is seldom positive. It can have a negative impact overall on how customers perceive even their actual experiences."" If there's a key lesson for industry leaders from the report, VanAmburg said, it's that technology can majorly improve customer satisfaction. While there are exceptions (self check-out lines, for instance, can often frustrate consumers), in many ways Web sites, chat help and other tech tools have been able to address customers' needs more smoothly. Banks, he said, have been particularly good at adding these features over the years, allowing much to be done online without having to go to a branch or make a phone call. ""The extent to which companies can help us satisfy ourselves — essentially, let us provide our own customer service — [works] very much to their advantage,"" VanAmburg said. ""Let's face it. As long as technologies work, they can't have a bad day."" Read also: Why Facebook wants to 'friend' your boss Like On Leadership?

If Brian Bailey has his way, the next time you deposit a check or withdraw cash, you’ll be talking to a virtual teller. Thanks to a growing number of interactive teller machines, some area customers can now complete a number of financial transactions via two-way video that allows them to communicate with bank workers in remote locations. “It’s a great use of self-service technology but it’s also personal because you’re face-to-face,” said Brian Bailey, a vice president at NCR, a New York-based technology company that sells interactive tellers to financial institutions. As banks and credit unions continue to shutter branches to cut costs, video tellers have emerged as a less expensive way for them to provide face-to-face services to customers. Many financial institutions, particularly smaller ones, are turning to interactive tellers as a way to beef up their presence in certain areas — rural communities, say, or inside a city supermarket — without investing in a bricks-and-mortar location and on-site staff. Like ATMs, the machines perform basic transactions such as deposits and withdrawals. But they also come equipped with video and audio capabilities, as well as check scanners and signature pads to accommodate more nuanced requests. More than 400 of the company’s interactive tellers have been installed around the world since 2012. Revenue from interactive tellers is expected to more-than-double to $100 million this year. “There are a number of different applications, both in terms of bringing banking services to city locations as well as serving the rural population across the U.S.,” he said. Community banks and credit unions have been among the earliest to sign on, Bailey said. But now, about two years since NCR began offering interactive tellers, larger banking giants such as Bank of America and U.S. Bank have begun rolling out the technology. “Retail banks today are under quite a bit of pressure,” Bailey said. “This allows them to continue to provide services without adding the expenses of a traditional branch.” The number of bank branches in the Washington area has been falling in recent years as banks face higher regulatory costs. There were 1,750 branches in the metro area as of June 2013, 28 fewer than the year before, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. (Nationally, 727 bank branches closed between mid-2012 and mid-2013.) Video tellers typically cost between $50,000 and $60,000, about the same as an ATM, Bailey said. At the State Employees Credit Union branch in College Park, members have been using interactive tellers for the past year. The credit union, which is headquartered in Linthicum, is using the new machines in a handful of branches, including one that opened last week in downtown Baltimore. “Customer reaction has been quite good,” said Peggy Tucker, senior vice president for member relations and branch operations at the credit union. “Members are easily adapting to the new technology.” The credit union’s four teller machines are manned by three employees who work in a central office at SECU’s headquarters. The arrangement is cheaper and more efficient than hiring additional employees at each location, Tucker said. “One of the biggest benefits of having the video teller is that we are able to offer expanded teller hours,” she said, adding that members can access the machines after-hours in the branch lobby. There are other upsides too, says Bailey: Say you want to withdraw more cash than the ATM allows, or want to cash a check down to the penny. (The teller machines come stocked with a range of coins and bills for this purpose, he said.) “Or if you have to do a number of complex transactions together — deposit a check, pay a bill and maybe get some cash back, that’s a set of transactions that’s much easier to do face-to-face,” he said. Still, he added, certain needs, such as opening a bank account or applying for a loan, must still be done in person. The machine “does 95 percent of what a teller can do inside the branch,” Bailey said. “But not everything.”	298	26	306	2023-03-28T15:09:13.466094Z	2023-03-28T15:09:13.466196Z	291.642	"[{""start"": 576, ""end"": 645, ""text"": ""As banks and credit unions continue to shutter branches to cut costs,"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1948, ""end"": 2173, ""text"": ""This allows them to continue to provide services without adding the expenses of a traditional branch.” The number of bank branches in the Washington area has been falling in recent years as banks face higher regulatory costs."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2174, ""end"": 2401, ""text"": ""There were 1,750 branches in the metro area as of June 2013, 28 fewer than the year before, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Bank branches have long been a trusty space-filler for commercial landlords. They'll pay whatever rent you charge, pretty much. Though nobody's particularly excited about a new bank branch in their neighborhood, residents usually won't resist them, either. And weirdly, despite the seeming ubiquity of ATMs and online banking, bank branches haven't gone the way of the travel agency or even the real estate office. They're still all over major cities, taking up prime corners, to the point where New York City's Upper West Side passed a zoning overlay to limit their growth (although of course, there are still plenty of poor neighborhoods that don't even have a single one). In 2007, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that having a convenient bank branch was still the most important factor consumers looked at when deciding where to put their money, and having more branches tended to correlate with higher profits. As federal and state laws regulating the number of branches a bank could have were liberalized, the number of branches grew by 27 percent from 1994 to 2006. At the same time, though, the branches were getting leaner--the average bank outpost had 20 employees in 1988, but only 14 in 2004. Branch networks finally started to shrink in 2010, when banks shed 1,100 locations, according to research firm Bancography. The decline has continued over the past couple of years, led by the troubled Bank of America, which shuttered 193 branches in 2012. Meanwhile, the number of transactions per branch declined too, from 10,200 per month in 2007 to 7,600 per month in 2012. It's not because people aren't depositing cash. Consumers who are less willing to spend money in a shaky economy are more likely to sock it away in a bank account (especially in Washington D.C., which leads the nation's large cities in deposit growth). And it's not entirely because people are banking online. Rather, it's because a number of large banks in the same markets have merged--like Wachovia and Wells Fargo, or BB&T and Colonial--and decided to save on real estate costs by closing down branches. The Wall Street Journal recently parsed the branch closing phenomenon, focusing on the small towns that lose an important institution when a bank closes its doors. And the Atlanta Journal-Constitution points out that even if people do their day-to-day money management online, they still like a branch nearby to open an account and conduct significant transactions, like taking out a loan. So bank branches will likely never disappear completely--they're just a less reliable option for landlords looking to rent a storefront.	297	26	305	2023-03-28T15:04:17.763631Z	2023-03-28T15:04:17.763760Z	319.945	"[{""start"": 415, ""end"": 573, ""text"": ""They're still all over major cities, taking up prime corners, to the point where New York City's Upper West Side passed a zoning overlay to limit their growth"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1221, ""end"": 1344, ""text"": ""Branch networks finally started to shrink in 2010, when banks shed 1,100 locations, according to research firm Bancography."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1345, ""end"": 1476, ""text"": ""The decline has continued over the past couple of years, led by the troubled Bank of America, which shuttered 193 branches in 2012."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1477, ""end"": 1597, ""text"": ""Meanwhile, the number of transactions per branch declined too, from 10,200 per month in 2007 to 7,600 per month in 2012."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1908, ""end"": 2104, ""text"": ""Rather, it's because a number of large banks in the same markets have merged--like Wachovia and Wells Fargo, or BB&T and Colonial--and decided to save on real estate costs by closing down branches"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 415, ""end"": 573, ""text"": ""They're still all over major cities, taking up prime corners, to the point where New York City's Upper West Side passed a zoning overlay to limit their growth"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
"When's the last time you visited your local bank? A Bankrate.com survey released today found that one in five Americans hadn't visited their bank at all in the past year. But perhaps more surprising, fully 50 percent of Americans had been to their local branch at least once in the past 30 days. Back in 2012, the American Banking Association found that 39 percent of Americans chose online banking as their preferred means of managing their accounts, more than twice the share who favored visiting their local branch (18 percent). Statistics like this one, coupled with the rise of online banking and virtual tellers, have led many to start ringing the death knell for the traditional neighborhood bank branch. What's the point of taking your paycheck to a teller when you can simply snap a photo of it on your phone? But today's Bankrate survey suggests these claims of death have been greatly exaggerated. It also sheds some light on who is and isn't going to the bank. Perhaps predictably, Millennials are the age group least likely to have visited a bank branch in the past week, at 19 percent. But Millennials aren't abandoning banks completely, they're simply going less often - 23 percent visited a bank in the last month, and another third went some time in the last year. Banks' efforts to reach younger customers have come in for some ridicule lately. JP Morgan had to abandon an attempted Twitter chat last year after trolls hijacked the hashtag to lob withering criticism at the company. A recent report by the Carlisle and Gallagher consulting group found that a whopping 87 percent of Americans found banks' use of social media ""annoying, boring or unhelpful."" All this suggests that banks might best focus less on the social media shenanigans, and more on providing the core services their customers need.

In the aftermath of one of the worst recessions in history, more Americans have limited or no interaction with banks, instead relying on check cashers and payday lenders to manage their finances, according to a new federal report. Not only are these Americans more vulnerable to high fees and interest rates, but they are also cut off from credit to buy a car or a home or pay for college, the report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. Released Wednesday, the study found that 821,000 households opted out of the banking system from 2009 to 2011 and that the so-called unbanked population grew to 8.2 percent of U.S. households. That means that roughly 17 million adults are without a checking or savings account. Another 51 million adults have a bank account, but use pawnshops, payday lenders or rent-to-own services, the FDIC said. This underbanked population has grown from 18.2 percent to 20.1 percent of households nationwide. The study also found that one in four households, or 28.3 percent, either had one or no bank account. A third of these households said they do not have enough money to open and fund an account. Minorities, the unemployed, young people and lower-income households are least likely to have accounts. Stubbornly high unemployment and underemployment have placed millions of Americans in precarious financial positions, leaving them unable to absorb overdraft charges or minimum-balance fees. In the past year alone, Wells Fargo, Capital One and SunTrust have alerted customers to pending fee hikes on checking accounts or have raised overdraft charges. Banks say service charges are needed to offset the loss of revenue from a cap on debit-card transaction fees imposed by the government. “Banks need to have pricing and practices that consumers can trust and allow them to build wealth and have economic mobility,” said Deborah Goldstein, chief operating officer at the Center for Responsible Lending. “If the account fees will leave them worse off, then its going to be a challenge for people to use banking services.” Banks say it is difficult to make money serving lower-income communities because the cost of managing their accounts outweighs the return. “There has to be a recognition that there are costs to providing accounts and those costs have to be covered,” said Nessa Feddis, vice president and general counsel at the American Bankers Association. She estimated that it costs banks up to $300 a year to maintain a checking account because of expenses such as processing transactions. National Community Reinvestment Coalition chief executive John Taylor argued that banks could make up some of that cost by the sheer volume of new accounts. Feddis disagreed. “You can’t take a losing account and make it up in bulk,” she said. “You’re not going to spend money to lose money.” Without access to traditional banks, Taylor said, Americans are susceptible to abusive practices at non-bank institutions and are likely to remain trapped in a vicious cycle of financial strain. “A part of changing the condition of unbanked people is keeping them away from predatory lenders who keep them mired in debt,” he said. “One of the reasons you had all of these mortgage companies preying on low-income communities is because there were no options.” A report from SNL Financial in April showed that banks have closed dozens of branches in neighborhoods with a median household income of $25,000 or less since 2007, shifting resources to areas where the median income is $100,000 or more. “The [Community Reinvestment Act] has had a significant impact over the last 30 years, but did not contemplate some of the new abuses that we’re seeing and the way banking has changed,” Goldstein said. “But we’ve now seen financial reform that includes additional consumer protection.” Congress passed the act in 1977 to address the shortage of credit available to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Consumer advocates, however, say that regulation has fallen short of ensuring that banks offer reasonably priced services. The newly minted Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has jurisdiction over non-bank institutions and plans to weed out predatory practices. The agency reviews compliance with federal consumer financial laws such as the Fair Credit Act. In the past year, a quarter of households have used at least one type of alternative financial service, such as a tax refund anticipation loan or money order, the FDIC study found. Some households, 7.5 percent, said they simply did not trust or feel comfortable dealing with banks. Another 6.6 percent said they could not open accounts because they lacked required identification or suffered from poor credit. A growing number of consumers without bank accounts are turning to prepaid cards, with nearly 18 percent of households, up from 12 percent in 2009, reporting the use of such products. Feddis of the banking association said prepaid cards are an innovative tool that banks could use to serve lower-income communities without incurring much cost. “There are fewer ways to access the account, so there are fewer opportunities for fraud, which banks pay a lot to protect against,” she said.	295	26	303	2023-03-28T14:56:21.988816Z	2023-03-28T14:56:21.988870Z	389.892	"[{""start"": 945, ""end"": 1045, ""text"": ""he study also found that one in four households, or 28.3 percent, either had one or no bank accou"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1595, ""end"": 1729, ""text"": ""Banks say service charges are needed to offset the loss of revenue from a cap on debit-card transaction fees imposed by the governmen"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1945, ""end"": 2403, ""text"": ""“If the account fees will leave them worse off, then its going to be a challenge for people to use banking services.” Banks say it is difficult to make money serving lower-income communities because the cost of managing their accounts outweighs the return. “There has to be a recognition that there are costs to providing accounts and those costs have to be covered,” said Nessa Feddis, vice president and general counsel at the American Bankers Association."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3292, ""end"": 3528, ""text"": ""A report from SNL Financial in April showed that banks have closed dozens of branches in neighborhoods with a median household income of $25,000 or less since 2007, shifting resources to areas where the median income is $100,000 or more"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3935, ""end"": 4057, ""text"": ""Consumer advocates, however, say that regulation has fallen short of ensuring that banks offer reasonably priced services."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4476, ""end"": 4887, ""text"": ""ome households, 7.5 percent, said they simply did not trust or feel comfortable dealing with banks.

Start-ups, including Simple and Moven, are battling it out with traditional banks for tech-savvy customers. They offer all of the basic services of a bank account — deposits, bill pay, savings — without overdraft and maintenance fees. The catch? You have to have a smartphone to get an account. Smartphones have become the center of financial services as companies latch onto technology that could help them reach the millions of people at the margins of the system at a fraction of the cost of traditional banking. Researchers at CEB Tower Group estimate that banks spend roughly $1.34 for tellers to process a transaction in a branch, while the same transaction on a smartphone costs one-tenth of that amount. “Basic retail banking products — checking, savings and credit — have low value and are extremely expensive to sell,” said Alex Sion, president of Moven, which has thousands of users. “To make money, banks either try to sell retail customers on loans or hit them with punitive fees.” All of the major banks offer mobile apps, but the technology is still tied to an old-guard operation with high overhead costs that make it difficult to provide accounts with little to no fees. Without a physical presence, mobile-only providers say they can keep costs to a minimum. Companies like Moven and Simple partner with FDIC-insured banks that handle the banking functions of their mobile apps, house customers deposits and issue debit cards. (CBW Bank in Kansas works with Moven, while Bancorp Bank backs Simple.) The start-ups make money off of interchange, the fee merchants pay when people purchase goods with plastic, and by splitting the interest the partner banks earn off of deposits. The firms say their mobile platforms offer a easy way for users to instantly track their spending. Moven gives users financial feedback each time they make a purchase. After swiping their debit card at the grocery store, for instance, customers may receive an alert that they have surpassed their allotted money for food that month. Simple, meanwhile, alerts its over 100,000 customers to their “safe to spend” balance — the amount of money left over once upcoming bills and pending transactions are taken into account. Simple customers typically set aside 30 percent of their money toward future purchases, a savings rate that easily eclipses the national average of 5 percent, said Josh Reich, chief executive and co-founder of the start-up. “We’re students of the world of behavioral finance,” he said. “There is a lot of research that shows that if you want people to save, there are a lot of user-experience tricks you can use. We’ve built that in, so by default people fall into the trap of saving money.” Low fees is what attracted Ozzy Urrutia, a 24-year-old visual branding designer in San Francisco, to Simple when it launched two years ago. He had closed his account at JPMorgan Chase because he was fed up with being “nickel and dimed” on transactions. “Banks get you into their so-called free checking accounts, with all of these requirements: you need to have a minimum balance of this or you need to write X amount of checks a month. If you fail to comply, they start charging you like $20 or $30 a month for maintenance fees,” he said. Urrutia called the savings tools at Simple “powerful.” He said, “They are trying to actively help you save, versus banks who say here’s an account, that’s it.” The designer is not a fan of the restrictions on depositing multiple checks at one time. And he realizes that he may eventually have to head back to a bank when he needs a mortgage or a car loan. These mobile apps are “not a one-stop shop yet in a way a traditional bank could be,” said Jennifer Tescher, chief executive of the Center for Financial Services Innovation. That may change. Simple, which was recently purchased by Spanish banking giant BBVA, is weighing an expansion into credit products now that it has the backing of an institution with scale and resources. But it’s unlikely that Moven will branch out into home or auto loans anytime soon, if ever. “As soon as you move down the credit path, all of a sudden the core deposit product becomes a means to an end,” said Moven’s Sion, who once worked at Citigroup. He said at some point the company may offer its customer data to lenders for use in underwriting loans. A big hurdle for these companies in scaling up their business is the general distrust that some consumers have of conducting financial transactions through their smartphones. Security experts say the information transmitted between servers and mobile devices is encrypted, much like in online banking, meaning the breach risks are about the same.	293	26	301	2023-03-28T14:44:08.355092Z	2023-03-28T14:44:08.355159Z	16.791	"[{""start"": 295, ""end"": 514, ""text"": ""martphones have become the center of financial services as companies latch onto technology that could help them reach the millions of people at the margins of the system at a fraction of the cost of traditional banking"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 516, ""end"": 710, ""text"": ""Researchers at CEB Tower Group estimate that banks spend roughly $1.34 for tellers to process a transaction in a branch, while the same transaction on a smartphone costs one-tenth of that amoun"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 516, ""end"": 710, ""text"": ""esearchers at CEB Tower Group estimate that banks spend roughly $1.34 for tellers to process a transaction in a branch, while the same transaction on a smartphone costs one-tenth of that amount"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
The bank of the future, according to Wells Fargo, relies on wireless devices, large touch-screen ATMs and is virtually paperless. At the company’s newest branch, which opened last week in the Northeast Washington neighborhood of NoMa, employees use tablets and smartphones to assist clients, and customers can have receipts e-mailed or text messaged to their phones. The location is the first of its kind. At about 1,000-square-feet, it is one-third the size of a typical branch. “It’s a very efficient use of space for us,” said Jonathan G. Velline, executive vice president for ATM banking and store strategy at Wells Fargo. “In a 3,000 square-foot store, we would have an area for full-service banking, and a separate area for self-service banking. Here we fit it all in once place. We started layering it all on top of each other, so this is our full-service, self-service and [one-on-one] banking space all in one.” Employees — there are currently three — have no assigned desks or workspaces. Instead, they use pop-out work stations to assist customers. Most basic needs — withdrawing money or depositing checks, for example — can be done using the store’s three ATMs, Golden said. When a client needs help opening a bank account or applying for a mortgage, employees lead them to mini work areas equipped with computers and cushioned benches. (When not in use, keyboards are stashed in drawers and monitors swivel toward the wall.) “This [new design] is driven by the marketplace,” said Michael L. Golden, Wells Fargo’s regional president for the Washington area. “We couldn’t have been here without this format — there just aren’t thousands of square foot of space available in many neighborhoods.” Traditional branches typically require up to 40 percent of the space to be designated for back offices, Velline said. Changing habits At night, bright yellow doors close off a portion of the branch to create a 24-hour ATM vestibule. In addition to standard $20 bills, the machines also dispense $1, $5 and $100 bills. The branch’s revamped design reflects broader changes in peoples’ banking habits, executive say. The majority of customers tend to favor wireless and mobile banking — at least most of the time. “But every four or six months, they might want personalized help with some issue,” Golden said. “We are prepared to fulfill every need.” Nazmul Haque, who works in NoMa, stopped by the new location early last week. He said he had closed his Wells Fargo bank account several years earlier, but decided to reactivate it when he saw the new branch in the first floor of the office building where he works. “I went in and it literally took five minutes [to reactivate my account],” Haque said. “It was very environmentally friendly — everything was electronic so I didn’t need to sign any hard copies. I’d never seen such a small location that had everything in it.” Even so, there are certain instances when employees might need to refer customers to one of three larger branches nearby. “If you’re a merchant and you have heavy needs in terms of cash and coins, we’re really not set up for that here,” Velline said. “We’re using this as an opportunity to learn what this format can deliver.” San Francisco-based Wells Fargo began working on the new design about 18 months ago, Velline said. In October, the bank built a prototype in a store basement in New York. “It was mostly dry wall and two-by-fours, but it allowed us to visualize exactly how things would come together,” Velline said. “How does this feel from the [employee]’s perspective, how does it feel from the customer’s perspective? How does it all fit together?” They tested different types of furniture and rearranged work spaces to make sure it was easy for customers to move from one area to the next. Velline said the company was not sure how many more of these new branches Wells Fargo would open, but said that they would be well-suited to urban markets where real estate can be expensive and difficult to come by. With $21.76 billion in local deposits — roughly 14 percent of the market share — Wells Fargo is the second-largest bank in the Washington area, behind Capital One. But Golden says there is still room to expand. “Clearly we have a sizeable market here,” he said. “But we also have an opportunity to grow.”	292	26	300	2023-03-28T14:34:57.446263Z	2023-03-28T14:34:57.446363Z	1.711	"[{""start"": 4, ""end"": 128, ""text"": ""k of the future, according to Wells Fargo, relies on wireless devices, large touch-screen ATMs and is virtually paperless"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"
Correction: This story has been updated to correct the median salary of a bank chief executive. The median chief executive pay is $552,000 not $552 million. Almost a third of the country’s half-million bank tellers rely on some form of public assistance to get by, according to a report due out Wednesday. Researchers say taxpayers are doling out nearly $900 million a year to supplement the wages of bank tellers, which amounts to a public subsidy for multibillion-dollar banks. The workers collect $105 million in food stamps, $250 million through the earned income tax credit and $534 million by way of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, according to the University of California at Berkeley’s Labor Center. The center provided the data to the Committee for Better Banks, a coalition of labor advocacy groups that published the broader study, to be released Wednesday, on the conditions of bank workers in the heart of the financial industry, New York. In the that state alone, 39 percent of tellers and their family members are enrolled in some form of public assistance program, the data show. “This is the wealthiest and most powerful industry in the world, and it’s substantially subsidized by our tax dollars, money that we could be spending on child care or pre-K,” said Deborah Axt, co-executive director at Make the Road New York, one of four coalition members. Profits at the nation’s banks topped $141.3 billion last year, with the median chief executive pay hovering around $552,000, according to SNL Financial. In contrast, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the median annual income of a bank teller at $24,100, or $11.59 an hour. For its report, the committee spoke with 5,000 bank tellers, customer service representatives and technicians about their pay, benefits and treatment in the workplace. Workers bemoaned their poor wages and long hours without overtime pay. Alex Shalom, 20, works part time at a Bank of America branch in Manhattan, where he makes $13.50 an hour, or $14,000 a year. The pay is barely enough to pay rent and cover his tuition at Hunter College, Shalom said. “It’s not a livable wage,” he said. “Bank of America is making all of this money . . . but we’re not getting paid for holidays.” Another common complaint among bank workers was the intense pressure to meet sales quotas. One Wells Fargo employee, Victoria, who would only give researchers her first name, claimed she received more than 50 e-mails a day from managers pushing sales goals. Employees, she said, had to aggressively peddle products “just to be able to keep our jobs.” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Richele Messick said: “Wells Fargo works hard to create a positive work environment for our team members and a culture of doing what is best for our customers.” Although banks have rebounded from the depths of the recession, analysts say they are still contending with economic headwinds that are placing pressure on revenues. As a result, they say, institutions may be less inclined to raise wages and maintain full-time staff. “The interest-rate environment is very unfavorable to banks. There is an increasing amount of regulation that has further squeezed profit margins,” said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “When margins are tight and you’re looking for maximum efficiency, you have to make tough decisions.” The committee’s report arrives as fast-food workers, retail employees and other low-wage workers stage strikes across the country, including one planned for Thursday. They are fighting to have their pay raised to $15 an hour and for an easier path to forming unions. “As this low-wage policy spreads beyond fast food into banking and other sectors, it makes it much tougher for the economy to grow,” said Gregory DeFreitas, an economics professor at Hofstra University. “People are scrapping by on so little, so the demand for products remains low and the broader economy is hurt.” Committee for Better Banks organizers say they are in the early stages of their fight and trying to make the public aware of workplace conditions. The release of the report Wednesday will kick off a week of events, including a rally in front of a Bank of America branch to protest the increasing reliance on ATMs with videoconference tellers. The bank stepped up the use of remote video tellers in the past year, raising concerns that the machines would eliminate branch workers. Officials at Bank of America declined to comment, but in the past the bank has said that the technology is meant to supplement, not replace, its branch employees.	291	26	299	2023-03-28T14:31:14.692795Z	2023-03-28T14:31:14.692891Z	11.965	"[{""start"": 2958, ""end"": 3267, ""text"": ""s a result, they say, institutions may be less inclined to raise wages and maintain full-time staff. “The interest-rate environment is very unfavorable to banks.

"Yesterday, JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon announced that the world's largest bank -- with its share price at record highs, despite paying out around $20 billion in settlements to regulators -- would be cutting loose 2,000 more people at its bank branches, on top of the 5,500 that got pink slips last year. Overall, it expects to have 20 percent fewer people staffing its storefronts than it did in 2011, as consumers get more used to automated banking services and not as many take out mortgages. It's not just JPMorgan. This year, banks closed more branches than ever and kept squeezing the number of people required to staff each one. It's actually a pretty quick reversal, given the long run-up in branch openings that halted only as banks merged and began to consolidate their retail operations. And it's leading to the demise of a profession that used to be an intro to the white-collar life: Labor economists call this problem a lack ""matching efficiency"": When people seem to be having trouble finding the available jobs. Matching efficiency declined dramatically after the Great Recession, which might have to do with stigma against the long-term unemployed, or a massive geographical mismatch between where people are and where people are needed. That's true even with financial jobs, even though they bounced back a bit, as the New York Fed illuminated in a recent study: Still, the Fed economists concluded that the biggest reason people aren't able to find jobs is...the lack of jobs. ""While the efficiency of the U.S. labor market has not yet recovered, the most important factor is still the low vacancy-to-unemployment ratio,"" they wrote. To further illuminate what's going on here, what are the 4 million jobs that Dimon says are going unfilled? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they're mostly in mining and logging, nondurable goods manufacturing, wholesale trade, professional and business services, and accommodation and food services. Three of those fields, as we noted yesterday, don't pay all that well. And as both journalist Adam Davidson and Wharton professor of management Peter Capelli explained a while ago, when people can't make a living on the kind of jobs they'd need training to get, they're less likely to go through the trouble. Take for example 24-year-old Kyle Higgins of Smyrna, Tenn. He started as a temporary worker for a staffing agency that places people at the Nissan plant in town. He says he worked every single day for four and a half months during a particularly busy period, because he needed the $10 an hour paycheck to support his infant daughter. He'd get there at 6:30 a.m., and leave 12 hours later, in whatever job on the line was necessary as temps came and left. After two years of that, without landing a full-time job with benefits at Nissan -- which can pay $25 an hour, for those fortunate enough to have gotten jobs there years ago -- he quit. ""People get in there, see what it's like, and leave,"" Higgins says. Since then, he says, he's gotten an HVAC license and an auto mechanic certification, but even those jobs require a few years experience. ""People who've been doing it for longer than I've been alive get all the jobs,"" he says. ""A guy can do an hour job and make what I make in a day."" So he's learning how to become a cut hair and hopes to start his own barbershop. Otherwise, the options are slim. ""They got the Coca-Cola plant, a couple warehouses, but other than that, if you don't want to flip burgers for the rest of your life, Smyrna really isn't the place,"" Higgins says. ""It's growing every day, but it's growing in fast-food places and movie theaters, like high school jobs, not career jobs."""	290	26	298	2023-03-28T14:26:01.921179Z	2023-03-28T14:26:01.921280Z	2.413	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 502, ""text"": ""ay, JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon announced that the world's largest bank -- with its share price at record highs, despite paying out around $20 billion in settlements to regulators -- would be cutting loose 2,000 more people at its bank branches, on top of the 5,500 that got pink slips last year.

Pink slips are piling up at Capital One Bank. The financial institution is eliminating hundreds of positions in an ongoing cost-cutting and reorganization of its retail banking operations, according to company officials. The latest move involves cutting nearly 500 assistant branch managers throughout the McLean-based bank’s 985 locations in its northeast, mid-Atlantic and southern regions. Of those employees discharged, 166 are in the Washington area. The bank based its decision on the branch size, number of transactions and complexity of operations, spokesman Steve Schoof said. Affected employees have been given the option of applying for other positions within the company or accepting a severance package. Weeks earlier, Capital One informed staff that it was removing an entire layer of management to simplify its organizational structure. The company previously focused on 14 sub-markets within three geographic regions, it now centers around eight expanded regions. Each of those eight regions will be led by a “local distribution executive.” George Swygert, former Wachovia regional president of retail banking for greater Washington, will oversee the Maryland-D.C. region. Virginia, meanwhile, will be in the hands of Kimberly Conte, who previously served as vice president and regional executive at Capital One. Officials at the bank would not make any executives available for comment. Swygert and Conte will report to Ken Kido, who joined the company last fall as senior vice president of local distribution. Kido is responsible for leading the bank’s branch operations and speciality sales. He reports to Jonathan Witter, regional president of the mid-Atlantic as well as president of retail and direct banking. Witter became the head of retail banking last May, when Lynn Carter stepped down as president of the bank. Her duties were dispersed to Witter and Michael Slocum, who now run the bank together. A leaner operating model As a result of the regional restructuring, 29 positions have been phased out, including district managers and market presidents. Four area executives were affected by the changes, including Denise Pope, who was a prominent director at Chevy Chase Bank. “In order to grow its network in a challenging economic environment, the bank requires a leaner and more efficient operating model,” Schoof said in an e-mail. In its most recent earnings release, Capital One reported a 25 percent jump to $2.6 billion in non-interest expenses in the fourth quarter. The bank attributed the surge to rising marketing and operations costs tied to the integration of prior acquisitions. Capital One’s rise to become the nation’s fifth largest bank in less than a decade was fueled by a string of bank purchases — Hibernia, North Folk Bank and Chevy Chase — that have led to continuous reconfiguration. “Capital One, when compared to its peers, has gone through much more transition than anyone else, and I suspect that is leading to a lot of internal changes,” local banking expert Bert Ely said. “To the extent that they’ve merged banks with different management styles, they’ve had that issue to deal with too.” All of those mergers have led to the departure of executives from the acquired banks. A number of former Chevy Chase workers left to join Burke & Herbert, EagleBank and Wells Fargo. Capital One, however, has picked up its share of refugees from other merger and acquisitions, including Swygert. Meanwhile, expenses incurred from the recent $9 billion acquisition of online bank ING Direct likely factored into Capital One’s cost cutting, said analyst Scott Valentin of FBR Capital Markets. “With the approval on ING, the Fed wanted to see more robust internal controls, policies, procedures. That was one of the reasons Capital One cited for the increase in expenses in the fourth quarter,” he said. Valentin anticipates further cost cutting at the margins, if there is further pressure on revenue. He said Capital One’s revenue outlook is improving amid continued, albeit nominal, loan growth. 29 Positions phased out, including district managers and market presidents, as part of the bank’s restructuring.	289	26	297	2023-03-28T14:21:48.927970Z	2023-03-28T14:21:48.928071Z	1.773	"[{""start"": 46, ""end"": 219, ""text"": ""The financial institution is eliminating hundreds of positions in an ongoing cost-cutting and reorganization of its retail banking operations, according to company officials"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3443, ""end"": 3637, ""text"": ""Meanwhile, expenses incurred from the recent $9 billion acquisition of online bank ING Direct likely factored into Capital One’s cost cutting, said analyst Scott Valentin of FBR Capital Markets."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1926, ""end"": 2079, ""text"": ""A leaner operating model As a result of the regional restructuring, 29 positions have been phased out, including district managers and market presidents."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1926, ""end"": 2078, ""text"": ""A leaner operating model As a result of the regional restructuring, 29 positions have been phased out, including district managers and market presidents"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
A new study by Marshall Lux and Robert Greene reports that since the enactment of Dodd-Frank community banks have lost market share at twice the rate that they did prior to Dodd-Frank. The authors note that many of the regulations implemented pursuant to Dodd-Frank are not linked to the size of the institution, thus there are economies of scale in regulatory compliance. Thus, regulatory costs tend to fall proportionally heavier on smaller banks, which, in turn, tends to promote consolidation of the industry (as I noted several years ago when I predicted that Dodd-Frank would promote industry consolidation). The study has lots of interesting data on the industry patterns of lending by various types of banks as well, most notably that large banks tend to make fewer agricultural loans than community banks.	288	26	296	2023-03-28T14:15:10.713168Z	2023-03-28T14:15:10.713278Z	1.365	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 183, ""text"": ""A new study by Marshall Lux and Robert Greene reports that since the enactment of Dodd-Frank community banks have lost market share at twice the rate that they did prior to Dodd-Frank"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 373, ""end"": 614, ""text"": ""hus, regulatory costs tend to fall proportionally heavier on smaller banks, which, in turn, tends to promote consolidation of the industry (as I noted several years ago when I predicted that Dodd-Frank would promote industry consolidation)"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 373, ""end"": 614, ""text"": ""Thus, regulatory costs tend to fall proportionally heavier on smaller banks, which, in turn, tends to promote consolidation of the industry (as I noted several years ago when I predicted that Dodd-Frank would promote industry consolidation)."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
Profits at banks and credit unions climbed during the second quarter as fee income rose and institutions reduce the money they set aside to cover losses on loans, according to separate regulatory reports released Thursday. In the three years since the official end of the recession, savings institutions have cleaned up their balance sheets by shedding troubled loans. That has allowed them to move money out of rainy-day funds to boost earnings. Raising revenue remains a challenge with interest rates low, but some institutions have upped their fee income through increased lending and trading. A $5.1 billion spike in trading income, reversing credit derivative losses a year ago, helped lift overall revenue for the banking industry, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Net operating revenue during the quarter hit $171 billion, up 3 percent, or $4.9 billion, from the same period a year ago. The FDIC said banks netted $42.2 billion in earnings in three months ending June, up $7.8 billion, or 22.6 percent, from a year earlier. The average return on assets, a key measure of profitability, inched up 1.17 percent, the highest quarterly gain for the industry since 2007. “Asset quality continues to recover, loan balances are trending up, fewer institutions are unprofitable...and the number of failures is significantly below levels of a year ago,” FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg said. Lending at the nation’s banks crept up by 1 percent, or $73.8 billion, during the second quarter. While to aggregate amount is significant, the pace of lending at banks falls short of credit unions. Credit unions reported $613.7 billion in total loans in the second quarter, an increase of nearly $14 billion from the previous quarter, according to the National Credit Union Administration. They have posted 5.5 percent loan growth over the last four quarters, the strongest annual growth since early 2009. The uptick in lending comes as financial cooperatives have attracted more members, nearly 2.1 million in the last four quarters. Membership has now reached 95.2 million across the country. “The increases in lending, net worth and membership are especially positive signs,” said Debbie Matz, chairman of the NCUA. “The brisk loan growth shows that federally insured credit unions are meeting the needs of more borrowers and putting their assets to productive use.” Demand for auto loans fueled much of the lending that financial cooperatives recorded in the second quarter, with lending for new vehicles expanded to $66.4 billion and lending for used cars rising to $121.3 billion, according to the NCUA. “If you look back through the financial crisis, credit unions continued to lend while banks pulled back or completely stop. That trend is just continuing on as the economy gets stronger,” said Dan Berger, president of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, a trade group. All told, credit unions pulled in $2.2 billion in net income in the Even as savings institutions continue to rebound, interest rate risk and legal hangover from the financial crisis still threaten to disrupt gains at the largest banks. “Banks continued their strong performance with robust earnings supported by a diverse product base, lower losses and an ongoing improvement in asset quality. At the same time, institutions face challenges as they recover from a one-two punch of rising compliance costs and weaker-than-normal loan demand that makes it difficult to grow topline revenue.”James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Association, a trade group.	287	26	295	2023-03-28T14:11:39.763516Z	2023-03-28T14:11:39.763614Z	69.525	"[{""start"": 2617, ""end"": 2898, ""text"": ""If you look back through the financial crisis, credit unions continued to lend while banks pulled back or completely stop.

"It started out as mild infatuation, but now it seems bankers have developed a full-blown crush on Amazon.com. From Citigroup to SunTrust, banking industry executives are gushing over the Internet retailer's use of analytics to figure out what customers want, a model that bankers see as the salvation for an industry being invaded by more nimble retail, tech and telecom competitors. Just like Amazon, banks collect vast amounts of information about their clients. Your bank knows what you buy, how much you spend and whether you have anything saved. That kind of intel could be used to anticipate whether you need a credit card, car loan or investments. It's one thing to simply offer a car loan, Thong Nguyen, the head of retail banking at Bank of America, said at a press breakfast in Manhattan Thursday. ""It's more interesting to see that you are on month 33 of your car loan payments...and then present you the opportunity to get a cheaper rate,"" Consumers--whether they are buying a Kindle or opening a checking account--want companies to make products relevant to their individual needs, Nguyen said. There is something to be said for getting an email of feminist reading suggestions from Amazon, after you've finished a Bell Hooks book on your Kindle. The banking industry is betting that the same sort of tailor-made approach could work for mortgages and credit cards too. The trick will be to do it without appearing creepy or intrusive. ""We’re chasing after the Amazon experience,"" Nguyen said. ""Amazon keeps moving to improve customer service. And we're going to invest more"" to replicate that kind of service. Nguyen said for banks to be successful at data-driven customer service, they would need to drill down into each client profile. The financial needs of a 28 year-old customer making $100,000 a year is not the same as a 63 year old with the same salary. Sure, they're both prime candidates for investment products, but would require a different mix of stocks and bonds. Or they may need different types of home loans. ""The things that we offer you won't change--credit cards, home loans, investments and what not--the way I engage you, make it relevant for you will,"" Nguyen said. This sort of individualized approach runs counter to the traditional banking model that relies heavily on a high volume of transactions. Who has the time to figure out what each customer needs when dealing with millions of accounts? But the entrance of Google, Wal-Mart and even Amazon into the payments space is putting pressure on banks to find new ways to reach and keep customers. Yet if banks use customer data solely for the purpose of selling more products, they may miss an opportunity to develop meaningful relationships, said Jennifer Tescher, president and chief executive of the Center for Financial Services Innovation. ""Banks could make a huge impact by using data to help consumers optimize their cash flow in real time,"" she said. ""Using data to predict a life event that's going to require a high-margin banking product is not the place to start."" She noted that PNC Bank and KeyBank track their customers' transactions and create a financial calendar that lists when bills are due or money scheduled for deposit, helping people manage their finances. ""Technology should enable us to solve the problem of having to juggle your inflows and outflows, particularly when the timing and the amount of money you have varies dramatically from month to month,"" Tescher said. ""If banks are able to do that, it would be an incredible value to customers."" It could also help to ease some of the consumer anxiety surrounding mobile banking. The platform is catching on, especially among  folks under the age of 35, but a good segment of the population remain distrustful of conducting financial transactions through their smartphones. A recent study by the National Council of La Raza and the Urban League found that nearly a third of the 5,000 people they surveyed were concerned about security controls. Banks and credit unions actually have tougher regulatory standards to guard consumer data than merchants do because of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999. That bit of information, coupled with the promotion of basic money management, could draw even more people to mobile. Nguyen said smartphones are the next frontier. Building out intuitive digital platforms, with the ability to send spending or bill pay alerts, could give customers the same sort of user-friendly experience that has made companies like Amazon popular. About 15 million Bank of America customers use their smartphones to transfer money or deposit checks, a number that Nguyen said has been growing at 20 percent a year. By comparison, the number of customers that bank online--roughly 30 million--has hit a plateau. As a result, Nguyen said Bank of America is investing in its mobile platform, with an aim of someday moving into mobile payments, whereby a merchant can scan a customer's smartphone to collect a payment. ""The next frontier is the payment technology,"" Nguyen said. "" We're going to be working with people who make phones, with people like Google, eBay and Paypal and see where it goes from there. The whole payment system is going to evolve.""

Human resources manager Teisha Williams has uploaded at least 20 job listings to the State Employees Credit Union of Maryland’s Web site in the past two months. The Linthicum-based financial cooperative typically has a handful of openings at any given time, but lately there has been a greater need for financial consultants and tellers. SECU, like many other credit unions in the Washington area, experienced a surge in new accounts amid the anti-bank sentiment that swept the country last fall. That activity, coupled with branch expansion and an uptick in mortgage refinancing, has been leading institutions to beef up on staff. “There has been an increase in the volume of activity and credit unions are positioning themselves for further growth as the economy continues to improve,” said John Bratsakis, head of the Maryland & D.C. Credit Union Association, which has an aggregate list of more than 50 job openings at area institutions on its Web site. It’s unclear how many available positions there are at local credit unions as the Labor Department does not drill down that far in its job openings data. According to the Credit Union National Association, full-time employment at local credit uions dropped to 2,864 in September 2011 from 2,878 a year earlier as investments in information technology eliminated the need for some staffers. Yet industry observers say hiring picked up as credit unions experienced growth in membership throughout 2011. Last year, SECU added 14,335 customers, 28 percent of whom signed up following Bank Transfer Day on Nov. 5, when consumers were encouraged to move their money out of big banks to avoid fees. During the week of the event, sparked by Bank of America’s short-lived plan to levy fees on debit cards, the number of new checking accounts at the credit union rose 62 percent over the same week in 2010 and 2009. “Business is increasing because more people are switching to credit unions, so we have to have the staff to meet their needs,” Williams said. Educational Systems Federal Credit Union chief executive Chris Conway said the furor surrounding banking fees led new customers to his door. The Greenbelt-based credit union, which serves members of the education field, added 1,000 members tlast year. Conway pointed out, however, that membership and headcount have been growing steadily for years. “We’ve hired because we’re expanding a few positions each year, and have done so for the last decade,” he said, noting the credit union currently has six job openings. At NASA Federal Credit Union in Upper Marlboro, new loan originators are in demand as more members seek to refinance their mortgages, said chief executive Doug Alliman. “With rates as low as they are, we’ve seen activity pick up in that area,” he said. NASA FCU, Alliman added, has ramped up its marketing to educate consumers about their eligibility to join, contributing to a 20 percent increase in new members. A number of credit unions started such campaigns last year, which Bratsakis of the credit union association suspects contributed to industry-wide growth.	284	26	292	2023-03-28T14:01:09.254304Z	2023-03-28T14:01:09.254403Z	54.606	"[{""start"": 2006, ""end"": 2145, ""text"": ""Educational Systems Federal Credit Union chief executive Chris Conway said the furor surrounding banking fees led new customers to his door"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2006, ""end"": 2145, ""text"": ""Educational Systems Federal Credit Union chief executive Chris Conway said the furor surrounding banking fees led new customers to his door"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"
When Wells Fargo opened its first high-tech branch three years ago in the District’s NoMa neighborhood, it did away with desks and replaced traditional counters with large touch-screen ATMs. Also gone from its new location: tellers. Instead, the 1,000-square-foot branch has a handful of tablet-toting employees to help customers navigate technology to deposit checks, apply for loans or open savings accounts. It’s a model that’s being replicated throughout the region, leading to a shift in the number — and types — of employees at area banks. The number of banks tellers in the region has dropped by nearly half in the past 10 years, from 10,980 in 2005 to 5,990 in 2015, outpacing a 17 percent drop nationally, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Overall employment in the Washington region rose 7.3 percent in the same period. Median annual pay for tellers, meanwhile, has risen 35 percent, to $32,250 as tellers are increasingly required to be well-versed in technology. A recent report by Citigroup estimates that an additional 30 percent of U.S. banking jobs could be eliminated by 2025 as financial firms shutter branches and invest more heavily in technology. “There has been a tremendous change in the mix of bank employees, with a much greater reliance on tech workers,” said Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant in Alexandria. “Banks are cutting a lot of so-called back-office processing jobs — and that is something that will continue.” Experts say the trend is likely to be magnified in the Washington area, where an influx of young professionals and tech-savvy customers has ushered in a number of high-tech branches that require few employees. Recent bank mergers and branch closings also have contributed to shrinkage in the pool of jobs. “Traffic in branches is down dramatically,” said Ronald D. Paul, chief executive of Bethesda-based Eagle Bancorp, the region’s largest community bank. “You just don’t need that many branches anymore.” As a result, the company has closed less-frequented branches and moving others into smaller spaces. It also is adding more high-tech workers, including computer programmers and commercial deposit officers who can help trouble­shoot technology, to its ranks. The number of bank branches in the Washington region has been steadily dropping in recent years. Last year, the area had 1,697 branches, 84 fewer than it did in 2010, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “It was the ATM that started this spiral 25 or 30 years ago,” said Stephen Fuller, an economist and senior adviser at George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis. “We’ve just about replaced the need to have people in those spaces.” Indeed, nearly four in 10 Americans have not visited a bank or credit union branch in at least six months, according to a survey by Bankrate.com, a New York-based personal-finance information company. When customers do stop by the bank, it is generally for financial consultations or to open accounts, not routine transactions, the survey found. “The bank as it is today is becoming more interactional and less transactional,” said David M. Glaser, a vice president at District-based National Capital Bank. “When people come in, it’s with a more complex question or to open an account. If they just need to deposit a check — well, they can do that at the ATM.” At PNC, which has done away with tellers at a number of area branches, new hires are as likely to come from a tech company as from another bank, said Todd Barnhart, head of branch distribution. “The way we think about recruiting has changed pretty significantly,” he said. “Five or 10 years ago, we might have looked at employees at the bank down the street. “Today we’re looking at people from the Apple store, AT&T store and other tech-centric retailers.” The company’s “innovation branch” in Tenleytown, for example, has six employees, all of whom are trained to help customers with everything from deposits to loan applications. “We’re not building branches with teller lines but with places where customers and employees can have meaningful conversations,” he said. Instead of having separate tellers and mortgage officers, “it’s one job, one person,” Barnhart said, adding that roughly half of the bank’s deposits now come through its mobile app or ATMs. “What people are looking for in a bank is much different than it used to be,” he said. “Employees need to be prepared to answer things like, ‘How do I do this on my mobile phone?’ or ‘How do I do this online?’ ” Among Americans with smartphones, 52 percent used mobile banking in 2014, according to a Federal Reserve survey. The vast majority of users — 94 percent — use mobile apps to check their account balances, while 61 percent use them to transfer money between their accounts and 51 percent to deposit checks. The median frequency of use was five times a month. Meanwhile, national bank employment has been falling an average of 2 percent a year since the recession, according to the Citigroup report. “The future of branches in banking is about focusing on advisory and consultation rather than transactions,” according to the Citigroup report. “Branches and associated staff costs make up about 65 percent of the total retail cost base of a larger bank and a lot of these costs can be removed via automation.” Banks in Scandinavia, Finland and the Netherlands have cut branches by roughly 50 percent from recent peak levels, according to the Citigroup report. If U.S. banks were to take similar measures, they could save as much as $175 billion in costs and add 39 percent to their pretax profit, the report said. “This is all part of a technological evolution that is taking place in banking,” Ely said. “In this low-interest-rate environment, banks are under great pressure to cut costs, and one of the easiest ways to do that, among other things, is through branch closures and consolidations.”	283	26	291	2023-03-28T13:56:38.797403Z	2023-03-28T13:56:38.797506Z	95.385	"[{""start"": 996, ""end"": 1188, ""text"": ""A recent report by Citigroup estimates that an additional 30 percent of U.S. banking jobs could be eliminated by 2025 as financial firms shutter branches and invest more heavily in technology."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1931, ""end"": 1977, ""text"": ""You just don’t need that many branches anymore"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2707, ""end"": 2907, ""text"": ""ndeed, nearly four in 10 Americans have not visited a bank or credit union branch in at least six months, according to a survey by Bankrate.com, a New York-based personal-finance information company."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4002, ""end"": 4138, ""text"": ""We’re not building branches with teller lines but with places where customers and employees can have meaningful conversations,” he said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4330, ""end"": 4415, ""text"": ""What people are looking for in a bank is much different than it used to be,” he said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 4541, ""end"": 4845, ""text"": ""mong Americans with smartphones, 52 percent used mobile banking in 2014, according to a Federal Reserve survey.
