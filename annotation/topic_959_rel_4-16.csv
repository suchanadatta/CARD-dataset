Fiddling while Rome burns: It’s used as an image of leaders ignoring serious problems for their own amusement. In the case of Baltimore Symphony Orchestra musicians, though, fiddling through a crisis represents an attempt to save their orchestra. Faced with a lockout that began June 17, weeks after management announced cancellation of the summer season, BSO musicians are trying to figure out how to pay mortgages, afford health insurance and make it through the summer. Some have already departed to substitute with other orchestras — Ivan Stefanovic, the associate principal second violin, left Monday morning for the Atlanta Symphony. But most are staying here and planning to perform at the annual Independence Day event July 3 — one of the events that the BSO announced it was canceling but which Baltimore County is going ahead with anyway. The orchestra members were going to pitch in free, but a grant from the Music Performance Trust Fund, an independent public service organization, and the Film Funds, will make it possible for them to be paid. The county is arranging the fireworks, food vendors, security and parking — using money that would otherwise have gone to the BSO. “We were in a position to use existing funding through a grant we provide the BSO,” said T.J. Smith, the press secretary for Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski. “Part of the grant is the Independence Day extravaganza. Considering that’s not happening, we were able to use the funding that already existed to put on a portion of it.” The concert will go off “essentially as planned,” Smith said, though “there are a few logistical things that will be different.” It will also be on a slightly smaller scale, with an audience of about 5,000. The Independence Day concert is usually a moneymaker for the orchestra, says Brian Prechtl, a percussionist and member of the orchestra committee. This year, for the first time, it will be free to the public, though it remains a ticketed event. The free tickets were all snapped up last week. The musicians are trying to maintain continuity in other ways. The popular Academy Week, which allows amateur musicians to play side by side with orchestra players, was among the canceled events, but players are trying to continue it in some modified form, emphasizing mainly chamber music, between July 12 and 21. What the musicians aren’t trying to replace are some of the summer’s other big events, including a showing of a Harry Potter film with live orchestral accompaniment, and a concert with the popular Broadway star Leslie Odom Jr. Both of these concerts are the kinds of things that orchestras often put on to expand their audience base and make money. Many of the locked-out musicians are or will be applying for unemployment. “It’s very hard to get a summer festival gig on short notice,” Prechtl said. Most musicians cling to a prized summer festival post, which allows them to work in beautiful surroundings; Prechtl has been playing with the Grand Teton Music Festival in Wyoming for 27 years. Orchestras do, however, sometimes need a substitute at short notice, and many are eager to help out the Baltimore musicians with work. The Seattle Symphony called Prechtl asking about violists who might be available. Prechtl, for his part, has had to turn down paying work, because his position as players’ committee spokesman is keeping him so busy during the lockout. All members of the committee, he says, feel they have a commitment to the players and shouldn’t leave until things are more settled. For some musicians, there’s a more immediate logistical problem: Their larger instruments are inside Meyerhoff Hall, which the orchestra is locked out of, and they have no way to get them out for the concert — nor is there a crew available to move them. Musicians will have to use their personal instruments, which in Prechtl’s case include timpani and a bass drum. “We might have to rent a truck,” he said. anne.midgette@washpost.com	848	"[{""start"": 300, ""end"": 471, ""text"": ""management announced cancellation of the summer season, BSO musicians are trying to figure out how to pay mortgages, afford health insurance and make it through the summer"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	827	2023-05-03T10:19:39.847250Z	2023-05-03T10:19:58.853301Z	249.873
The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra announced Thursday that it is eliminating this year’s summer programming. Seven months after putting forth a contract proposal to musicians that would cut the season from 52 to 40 weeks a year, the orchestra said it was advancing aggressively in that direction, first by canceling its promising New Music Festival, a pet project of Music Director Marin Alsop that this year was to celebrate female composers, as well as much of the popular summer programming, including a concert with Leslie Odom Jr., live accompaniment to “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,” and the annual Fourth of July concert. The decision comes just a little over a month after the summer season was announced and only six days after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) approved a bill providing $3.2 million in state funding for the orchestra, the result of a request by a musician-led consortium for state aid. In its announcement, the orchestra cited $16 million in losses over the past decade. “If the BSO is going to survive,” said orchestra president and chief executive Peter Kjome, “our business model needs to change.” “Legislation passed this session in Annapolis sought to provide some immediate funding to address short-term financial issues,” the statement said. But, it continued, “the legislation did not fully address the long-term, systemic issues or reform the BSO business model.” The orchestra’s musicians have been playing without a contract since Sept. 9, with the proposed cuts to the season the major issue in the stalled negotiations. The players were blindsided by Thursday’s announcement, said Greg Mulligan, a first violinist and co-chairman of the orchestra committee that represents the players in negotiations. “We’re very disappointed,” he said. “After the citizens of Maryland and the legislature and governor advocated for us by eventually passing the bill, we cannot understand why they’re taking this action.” The next bargaining session is scheduled for Tuesday. Mulligan said that at a hastily convened meeting Thursday, the players asked management to put off the announcement until after that session but that management declined. Players see the threat as existential. “When you change an orchestra from 52 weeks to 40, and cut pay by that much, it’s going to change the kind of players who come here,” Brian Prechtl, a percussionist and the other chairman of the orchestra committee, said in a conversation last fall about the ongoing contract negotiations. “Some great players will leave.” Baltimore’s situation epitomizes the basic conflict that has marked orchestral labor struggles across the country: musicians’ claims to a fair and regular salary for a highly skilled job against the decrease in demand for concerts. This season, Chicago Symphony Orchestra musicians staged a strike for almost seven weeks, the longest in the orchestra’s history, over proposed changes to their pension plans, which ultimately went through largely as management had proposed. The Minnesota Orchestra and Detroit Symphony Orchestra have both emerged remarkably rejuvenated after long and bitter labor disputes — in the case of the Minnesota Orchestra, not a strike but a lockout. The BSO, which is based in a city that is not wealthy and has no great depth of industry to provide corporate funding, has long struggled financially. (The Cleveland Orchestra, faced with a similar predicament, has introduced an annual residency in Florida, enabling it to tap into a second donor base.) In 2009 and 2010, the BSO musicians agreed to voluntary salary reductions, which they had earned back by 2016. For the past two years, they have played on one-year extensions of the previous contract; the second of those expired in September. “As long as they pay us, we’re going to play,” Mulligan said. “They’ve said they’re going to pay us through concerts on June 16, and after that they’re not going to pay us. It’s not going to be a strike; it’s going to be lockout.” anne.midgette@washpost.com	847	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 105, ""text"": ""he Baltimore Symphony Orchestra announced Thursday that it is eliminating this year’s summer programming"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 107, ""end"": 346, ""text"": ""Seven months after putting forth a contract proposal to musicians that would cut the season from 52 to 40 weeks a year, the orchestra said it was advancing aggressively in that direction, first by canceling its promising New Music Festival"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 919, ""end"": 1002, ""text"": ""n its announcement, the orchestra cited $16 million in losses over the past decade"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1301, ""end"": 1405, ""text"": ""“the legislation did not fully address the long-term, systemic issues or reform the BSO business model.”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2065, ""end"": 2175, ""text"": ""the players asked management to put off the announcement until after that session but that management declined"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2771, ""end"": 3011, ""text"": ""This season, Chicago Symphony Orchestra musicians staged a strike for almost seven weeks, the longest in the orchestra’s history, over proposed changes to their pension plans, which ultimately went through largely as management had proposed"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 919, ""end"": 1002, ""text"": ""n its announcement, the orchestra cited $16 million in losses over the past decade"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	826	2023-05-03T10:15:43.803135Z	2023-05-03T10:15:43.803239Z	174.413
Marin Alsop led an expansive, complicated rendition of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony under difficult conditions Saturday night in the Music Center at Strathmore. The last time she conducted the work, in 2009, she made the mistake of pairing it with an inferior work by Leonard Bernstein. This time around it stood alone, suffused with regret and nostalgia. Anxiety about the future has hovered over the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra all season. Management has insisted the orchestra become a part-time ensemble by cutting back the season from 52 weeks to 40 weeks. At the end of May, after an extended contract dispute, management abruptly canceled the orchestra’s summer season, suspending musicians’ pay as of June 16. Mahler’s Ninth Symphony is a leave-taking, composed after the death of the composer’s young daughter. Much of the first movement obsesses over the three-note motif “Lebewohl” (Farewell), taken from Beethoven’s piano sonata “Les Adieux.” After an ethereal opening in cello and harp, Alsop wrung as much pathos and urgency as she could from this music — and those emotions seemed to resonate with the orchestra’s situation. The rough-hewed second movement plodded along somewhat rudely, the second violins hacking away unceremoniously at the first statement of the Ländler. The third movement darted and bit even more bitterly, the viciously maintained counterpoint interrupted by a crystalline, mournful trumpet solo around the midpoint. The entire violin section, one of the BSO’s greatest assets, sang their hearts out in the opening of the concluding Adagio, marked “grosser Ton” (with big tone) in the score. The plush string section, including heart-melting solos from concertmaster Jonathan Carney, sustained the time-stopping tempo set by Alsop, complemented by gorgeous horn solos. One early flute entrance aside, quickly righted, it was a moment to glory in the sound of the BSO, just before its likely dismantlement at the hands of its own management. At the start of the concert, the entire orchestra took the stage together, in a gesture of solidarity. The devoted Strathmore audience responded with standing ovations both at the beginning and end of the concert. The affection in the hall was palpable, but it may not be enough to save this esteemed ensemble from diminishment. style@washpost.com	846	"[{""start"": 438, ""end"": 556, ""text"": ""Management has insisted the orchestra become a part-time ensemble by cutting back the season from 52 weeks to 40 weeks"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 558, ""end"": 712, ""text"": ""At the end of May, after an extended contract dispute, management abruptly canceled the orchestra’s summer season, suspending musicians’ pay as of June 16"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1893, ""end"": 1973, ""text"": ""he BSO, just before its likely dismantlement at the hands of its own management"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1893, ""end"": 1973, ""text"": ""he BSO, just before its likely dismantlement at the hands of its own management"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	825	2023-05-03T10:12:47.308604Z	2023-05-03T10:12:47.308719Z	119.24
The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra opened its season at Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, its home house, on Friday night. This sounds like a routine statement, yet it contains a world of news: As recently as last week — after the musicians had been locked out by management all summer, and in the midst of negotiations that didn’t seem to be bringing the two sides any closer together — it seemed highly likely that the performance, if not, indeed, the season, would be postponed. So when conductor Marin Alsop and the musicians took the stage in this warm and homey auditorium, they were greeted with a long ovation. “I’m not sure I can talk,” said a visibly moved Alsop, after leading the national anthem that orchestras around the country play at the start of their seasons. The issue has been whether the orchestra can afford to continue in its current form. The management avers that a 52-week season is no longer viable, and that the orchestra needs to reduce to a 40-week season to survive. Musicians argue that cutting back the season would lower prestige and drive away players. This put management in the odd position of trying to prove to the world just how badly it had managed its money so far, canceling its summer season only weeks after announcing the program, and then locking out its musicians for the 10-week duration. The new agreement is a one-year contract extension that simply kicks the problems down the road. The contract is for 50 weeks (the lockout accounts for the two missed weeks), but provides pay for a 40-week season; the other 10 weeks are being covered by a $1.6 million donation from “special friends of the BSO.” There is no guarantee that those special friends are going to come forward next year. The contract stipulates that management will hire new musicians to fill existing vacancies; the board will create a Vision Committee with musicians to plan for the orchestra’s future; and there will be no strike and no lockout through next September. Negotiations, one presumes, will continue. All of this background puts any concert under a kind of existential filter. What is the purpose of the orchestra? How necessary is it to the city? How glad are people that it’s back? The answer to the last seemed to be “very”: The Baltimore audience, which always seems to me more relaxed and familial than the Kennedy Center’s, filled the hall, while members of the players’ committee greeted them in the lobby. To add another existential touch, fate was the theme of the program, with numbers such as the overture to Verdi’s “Forza del Destino;” Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony (which winds around a “fate” theme from the start); and the Voodoo Violin Concerto written in 2002 by the dynamic Daniel Bernard Roumain, a piece shot through with otherworldly implications, from the spiritlike voices of high flutes to an admixture of vernaculars from other genres, as if the orchestra were speaking in tongues. After the initial outburst of love, the night started on a sober note with a short piece by Christopher Rouse, the Baltimore-based composer and Pulitzer Prize winner who was BSO composer-in-residence in the 1980s and who died this month at the age of 70. Alsop offered a few reminiscences of him and the time she spent with him in his final days as he was dying of cancer (his only two regrets, she said, were his concern that the BSO might not play opening night, and that he might not see the Baltimore Orioles win). “Processional: Death of Poe” was one of the works the orchestra commissioned for its centenary in 2016, a big dark piece growing to a powerful growl and then dying away — passing, as it were, before our ears and eyes. The other contemporary composer on the program was bursting with life: Roumain, also known as DBR, was engaging both as composer and performer. His concerto marshals familiar tropes from jazz, blues and folk music in an exuberant synthesis that is neither forced nor hackneyed, as such quotes too often are. Fiddling on his amplified instrument, or taking his bow in his teeth to pluck the strings like a guitar, and even singing into the mic at one point, he drew the orchestra after him in call-and-response episodes, and the audience into enthusiastic applause, a response to this welcome jolt of musical reality in a normally rarefied world. Alsop’s Verdi was overcharged and not altogether idiomatic, lacking Verdian flow in the interest of trying to land points at big moments. And the evening overall had a slightly raucous quality, the sound of energy funneling itself into a small space. This wasn’t a bad thing, though it gave the Tchaikovsky the sense of a jigsaw puzzle, with the joins apparent between the pieces of the picture. But the piece also crested to a great crashing wave of a finale, and the evening overall gave several perspectives to the issue of why an orchestra is, after all, worth it. anne.midgette@washpost.com	845	"[{""start"": 860, ""end"": 994, ""text"": ""The management avers that a 52-week season is no longer viable, and that the orchestra needs to reduce to a 40-week season to survive."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 188, ""end"": 476, ""text"": "": As recently as last week — after the musicians had been locked out by management all summer, and in the midst of negotiations that didn’t seem to be bringing the two sides any closer together — it seemed highly likely that the performance, if not, indeed, the season, would be postponed"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1085, ""end"": 1334, ""text"": ""This put management in the odd position of trying to prove to the world just how badly it had managed its money so far, canceling its summer season only weeks after announcing the program, and then locking out its musicians for the 10-week duration."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1734, ""end"": 1984, ""text"": ""The contract stipulates that management will hire new musicians to fill existing vacancies; the board will create a Vision Committee with musicians to plan for the orchestra’s future; and there will be no strike and no lockout through next September."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 188, ""end"": 476, ""text"": "": As recently as last week — after the musicians had been locked out by management all summer, and in the midst of negotiations that didn’t seem to be bringing the two sides any closer together — it seemed highly likely that the performance, if not, indeed, the season, would be postpone"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 1734, ""end"": 1983, ""text"": ""The contract stipulates that management will hire new musicians to fill existing vacancies; the board will create a Vision Committee with musicians to plan for the orchestra’s future; and there will be no strike and no lockout through next September"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	824	2023-05-03T10:10:38.422539Z	2023-05-03T10:10:38.422610Z	243.044
It’s official: It’s a lockout. On Sunday night, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra confirmed what it effectively announced on May 30: The musicians of the orchestra are locked out. On May 30, the orchestra announced that it would be canceling its summer season and ceasing to pay its musicians as of June 16. The musicians have been playing without a contract since September; still, the only way that the orchestra can legally stop paying them is to announce a lockout. The orchestra’s news release went out late Sunday night, only hours before the end of the last day the musicians were to draw pay, and only a short time after the players themselves had been informed, according to Peter Kjome, the orchestra’s president and CEO. Players and management are returning to the negotiating table Friday, in the presence of federal mediators, although the negotiations are not yet officially in mediation. Whatever the outcome, Kjome says that the lockout will end on Sept. 9, when the orchestra is scheduled to reconvene for the fall season. Musicians, however, are highly unlikely to resume work unless a contract agreement has been reached. “To be out for 12 weeks and then come back and take the 20 percent cut they wanted to give us in the first place, would you be willing to do that?” said Brian Prechtl, a percussionist and co-chair of the BSO’s orchestra committee. The lockout effectively achieves a goal that management announced it was seeking as early as October, when it proposed cutting the BSO’s season from 52 weeks to 40 weeks. On May 24, House Bill 1404, which included provisions for $3.2 million for the orchestra over two years, and which had passed both houses of Maryland’s state assembly, was not among the bills vetoed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R), and the orchestra breathed a sigh of relief. However, according to Kjome, the money was not immediately forthcoming; he could not get a letter of intent from the legislature to present to the bank for a short-term loan. The orchestra’s $60 million endowment, Kjome says, is already drawn to capacity, at a rate of 5.75 percent as well as a $5 million loan. “Our endowment trust,” he says, “views that further support without having significant changes to improve our business model is not fiduciarially responsible.” Kjome asserts that the orchestra has lost $16 million in the past decade, and blames previous administrations for having drawn down the endowment ­significantly in the past. In 2006, he said, more than $20 million was taken out of the endowment at another critical juncture. “At that time,” he said, “the endowment was restructured to protect assets so that this would not happen again.” He added, “I think about where we would be today if we had those additional funds.” Others say that Baltimore’s management and board have not done all they could to maximize donations and income, including an entire year during which the orchestra operated without a director of development, the organization’s chief fundraiser. The BSO is rare among American orchestras in having a full-fledged second home at Strathmore, in Montgomery County, one of the richest parts of the state. “The orchestra management over a number of years has never fully tapped the significant potential that Strathmore represents,” said Greg Tucker, a strategic communications consultant who is a former PR director for the orchestra and was for four years a board member, until 2018. And players believe the orchestra could still lean more heavily on the endowment. “They could be taking up to 7 percent by law,” Prechtl says. As it is, Prechtl says, the orchestra will be saving $2.5 million on musicians’ wages and health care if it sticks with its plan of continuing the lockout until September. “That’s all ­coming out of musicians’ pockets,” he says. “Our line of the budget has remained flat for the last 10 years.” The musicians made several significant concessions over a decade of contract negotiations; their contracts have only recently returned to 2008 levels. There is much debate about the 52-week season these days. Several orchestras, including ­Detroit, St. Louis and Atlanta, have cut back their seasons — Detroit, in the wake of a painful six-month strike in 2010 to 2011; Atlanta, after a lockout in 2012. (The orchestra was locked out again in 2014). The 52-week season is, in fact, a relatively recent development, dating from the 1970s and 1980s; before that, many orchestral musicians worked second jobs in the off­season. According to Prechtl, Detroit’s success is because it turned to best practices in marketing and development, and showed “a ­vision for what the orchestra can be.” Detroit, which has balanced its budget for the past six years, is doing well “not because of the 40-week season; it’s in spite of it.” “The problem,” Prechtl added, “is the people here making these decisions are not showing us their bright vision for the future. They seem to be reacting to the balance sheet. That’s not the way to run an institution. People don’t give you money because you need it; they give you money because you inspire them.” The musicians will return to the picket lines Tuesday. anne.midgette@washpost.com	849	"[{""start"": 48, ""end"": 178, ""text"": ""the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra confirmed what it effectively announced on May 30: The musicians of the orchestra are locked out."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 307, ""end"": 467, ""text"": ""The musicians have been playing without a contract since September; still, the only way that the orchestra can legally stop paying them is to announce a lockou"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1371, ""end"": 1540, ""text"": ""he lockout effectively achieves a goal that management announced it was seeking as early as October, when it proposed cutting the BSO’s season from 52 weeks to 40 weeks"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1039, ""end"": 1139, ""text"": ""Musicians, however, are highly unlikely to resume work unless a contract agreement has been reached."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1986, ""end"": 2121, ""text"": ""The orchestra’s $60 million endowment, Kjome says, is already drawn to capacity, at a rate of 5.75 percent as well as a $5 million loan"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2283, ""end"": 2456, ""text"": ""Kjome asserts that the orchestra has lost $16 million in the past decade, and blames previous administrations for having drawn down the endowment ­significantly in the past."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2457, ""end"": 2556, ""text"": ""n 2006, he said, more than $20 million was taken out of the endowment at another critical juncture"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2283, ""end"": 2356, ""text"": ""Kjome asserts that the orchestra has lost $16 million in the past decade,"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	823	2023-05-03T10:05:52.614661Z	2023-05-03T10:05:52.614724Z	634.486
