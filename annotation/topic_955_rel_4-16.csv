At one point in time, Union Station was one of the few places in the city where you could pick up a pair of slacks, catch a movie and grab a bite to eat. But the complex lost its appeal as the revitalization of Chinatown and the F Street corridor gave consumers a broader selection of stores and restaurants. Now that D.C. has a number of burgeoning shopping districts and high-profile retail projects under way, where does that leave Union Station? The sprawling complex, housing some 140 shops and restaurants, is in the midst of a $35 million renovation, repositioning its merchant mix with a concentration on food. The move comes as increased intercity bus service and the potential expansion of Metrorail capacity promise an influx of visitors. About 32 million people visit Union Station each year — 15.5 million local residents, 8 million tourists, 5 million commuters and 3.5 million office workers. Which begs the question of who should be the target audience for the retail. Missing the middle ground “Turning to a fast-casual solution makes so much sense because everyone eats at these places whether they are residents, tourists or travelers. It’s the common ground between all of the customer groups they are trying to serve,” said Heather Arnold, director of research and analysis at Bethesda-based StreetSense, a commercial real estate firm. Quick-serve eateries Yo! Sushi and Roti are slated to open by the summer, rounding out the list of seven fast-casual restaurants to set up shop in the past 24 months. Add the food court on the lower level, plus the five white-tablecloth bistros and dining will soon account for nearly 40 percent of the retail at the station. “Not everyone is interested in the food court or have time for fine dining, so we were missing that middle ground,” said Joe Press, senior vice president of Ashkenazy Acquisition, the New York City developer that in 2007 paid $160 million to lease Union Station for 84 years. Ashkenazy reconfigured space in the west hall to fit Roti and moved a popular liquor store to the lower level to accommodate a Pret a Manger restaurant near the Amtrak concourse. Press said the firm has signed a letter of intent with a national restaurateur he would not name to take over the former America Restaurant site. “What we’re trying to do is be more relevant for the neighborhood,” he said. “You can usually tell who is a tourist at Union Station — you don’t see them in the west hall, you see people in suits.” A glimpse of the long lunch lines in the west hall bear out Press’ observation, but offer no clear answer for whether the best use for the grand Beaux-Arts building is a glorified food court. Knitting together communities Union Station for now seems to be foregoing the local boutiques and artisan shops that have made other places shopping destinations. National chains, such as Ann Taylor and Victoria’s Secret, dominate the tenant line up. And with Ashkenazy negotiating three new leases with stores Press said are “similar to Ann Taylor,” that will continue. “Ann Taylor does well ... Jos. A. Banks does well, so we’re just trying to get more of the same price point and tenants along those lines,” Press said. He would not divulge exact figures, but said sales at the shops and restaurants were up 20 percent in the past year. Rents at Union Station, according to Press, are on par with those at Gallery Place and Georgetown — placing them in the range of $40 to $60 a square foot. Kiosks have a ubiquitous presence in the east hall, but many speciality mom-and-pop shops have been cleared out. Homegrown merchants have a better chance of finding affordable space nearby within the H Street corridor. The area’s thriving nightlife captured the attention of the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., the nonprofit created by Congress to manage the station in 1981. The organization plans to create an entrance accessing H Street Northeast and reinforce the overpass to accommodate planned streetcar service to the corridor. Knitting together the disparate communities could improve the flow of consumer traffic from Union Station to H Street, making the area a vibrant retail hub. Arnold of StreetSense, however, said, “Street retail works from a storefront-to-storefront approach. Union Station being Columbus Circle on one side and a parking garage on the other doesn’t have the kind of connection that would bolster retail activity around it.” Reimagining the old theater Retail only became a key feature of Union Station after the 105-year-old structure underwent a $160 million restoration in the late 1980s. Prior to that, the station had a hodgepodge of snack stands, a mortuary and a bowling alley, said general manager Mark Polhemus. “The restoration created a retail footprint that was a sufficient size to provide enough revenue to pay all of the expenses on the property,” he said. “We started out with a larger ratio of apparel, but added more food use when apparel tenants moved out.” A nine-screen movie theater once anchored Union Station, attracting a cross section of teenagers and tourists. Polhemus said the multiplex was forced to shutter in 2009 after losing customers to newer theaters. Ashkenazy has struggled to land a replacement tenant for the 40,000-square-foot space. To make the space more attractive, the developer wants to carve out two spaces for escalators from the main hall to the lower level. Ashkenazy has the backing of the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., but the historic preservation review is ongoing. Press said the company is considering dividing the former multiplex into two spaces or leaving it open for one large tenant. Either option is contingent upon approval of the plan. “Once we know what’s going to be there,” Press said, “then we can start talking to retailers and figure out the best set up.”	827	"[{""start"": 750, ""end"": 907, ""text"": ""About 32 million people visit Union Station each year — 15.5 million local residents, 8 million tourists, 5 million commuters and 3.5 million office workers."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	817	2023-05-02T12:02:27.189981Z	2023-05-02T12:02:27.190037Z	295.327
For the political and business leaders applauding a new vision for Union Station, now comes the hard part. Amtrak enjoyed one compliment after another Wednesday at a news conference announcing a $7 billion proposal to expand and improve rail service at Union Station, in conjunction with a plan to build a 3 million-square-foot development behind the station. D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), who noted that he went to elementary school nearby, said the plan would create a “thriving, teeming, vital” transit hub for the city. Former mayor Anthony A. Williams (D), who lives a few blocks away on H Street NE, said the plan would make the station “a celebration of what is best about our city.” And Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said that the bold plan was the right first step, to demonstrate the station’s potential, and that the next step was determining how to pay for it. “No plan for the decades fills in the funding details,” she said. But now that the vision is public, stakeholders have begun to discuss the difficult task of turning the plan’s glossy images into reality. John D. Porcari, the deputy U.S. transportation secretary and former Maryland transportation secretary, pledged support from the Obama administration. A bigger, more modern Union Station is “an essential element of President Obama’s vision for high-speed rail in America,” Porcari said. “To put it simply there is no do-nothing option,” he said. “It is either forwards or backwards. We’re looking at projections that Amtrak and commuter rail ridership at Union Station could more than double in the next 15 years alone.” Williams, the newly named president of the Federal City Council, could play a key role in shepherding the project. As mayor, Williams had a leading role in some of of the District’s biggest infrastructure projects of the past 15 years, including the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and Nationals Park. The business group he now leads was instrumental in the creation of Metro and the construction of Verizon Center. The post also affords Williams one of the five spots on the governing board of the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., the nonprofit organization that manages the historic rail hub and is searching for a new president to replace David S. Ball, who will leave at the end of the year. Williams said he was confident that the private sector, Amtrak, and federal and local officials would support the vision. “All of us are going to have to come together and work together on financing, come together, work together around the right organizational structure, come together, work together around the right program,” Williams said. Amtrak officials have raised the prospect of partnerships with private-sector interests in real estate or transportation. The transit agency could look to New York’s Penn Station for a model, according to Patrick L. Phillips, chief executive of the Urban Land Institute, a development research group. To develop Penn Station’s rail yards, New York issued financial and zoning incentives, extended a subway line and built the High Line public park. “This is what’s happening around the world when you look at multi-modal transportation centers. They create value, and that value can be shared among the public and the private,” Phillips said. Other experts were skeptical. “Any transportation project that’s going to attract a private investment has to have a fairly predictable revenue stream,” said an expert in private-public partnerships who asked not to be named because he had not studied the Union Station plan. “To come up with $7 billion is pretty challenging, for those kind of dollars, with that kind of asset. There haven’t been that many mega-billion-dollar public-private partnerships, and the bigger the project the more likely you’re going to have cost overruns.” Union Station already has a real estate partner, District developer John E. “Chip” Akridge, whose company paid $10 million in 2006 for the right to build above the tracks behind Union Station. Akridge plans a $1.5 billion development called Burnham Place. With as many as a dozen buildings and a reconnected street grid linking Capitol Hill, H Street and NoMa, Burnham Place would be bigger than City Center DC. Burnham Place, he said, “will transform an ordinary overpass that exists today into a beautiful civic plaza, with a trolley stop and a grand entrance to Amtrak’s magnificent new train hall.” There are economic benefits to that, Akridge added, and those are likely to outweigh even the $7 billion price tag. “The economic benefits to this region are humongous,” Akridge said. “They are at least double the cost of putting this thing in.”	826	"[{""start"": 360, ""end"": 524, ""text"": ""D.C.

It may be years, if not a decade, before construction begins on a proposed multibillion-dollar redevelopment of Union Station. But debate has already been heating up over a parking garage planned as part of the overhaul. The proposed $8 billion expansion would add concourses and tracks, broaden the retail options and improve bus and parking facilities at Washington’s busiest transit hub. A replacement parking garage with nearly 1,600 spaces — about one-third less than what’s currently available — would be attached to the station, according to the plan. Some D.C. elected officials and residents aren’t happy with the parking space and are urging planners and the project’s proponents to go even further in limiting parking. Some are proposing eliminating the parking option altogether. “The amount of parking proposed runs directly counter to our efforts to reduce automobile travel,” said Drew Courtney, a member of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission who represents neighborhoods adjacent to Union Station. By keeping hundreds of parking spots at the terminal, he said, Union Station will send a message to commuters that it’s a destination to be driven to and from. “More cars means more traffic, more congestion and more pollution,” Courtney said. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which owns the station, is leading the federal review of the project expected to be out for comment this spring and finalized by the end of the year. This will bring the expansion concept first announced in 2012 closer to construction, though proponents say the project may not be completely realized until 2040. The project, proposed by the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation and Amtrak, promises a complete overhaul of the nation’s second busiest rail station — after New York’s Penn Station — whose many facilities date back to the station’s 1907 opening. It would triple passenger capacity and transform the overcrowded station into a hub for high-speed rail. Union Station gets about 40 million visitors each year and is served by 85 to 90 intercity Amtrak trains on any given day. It is also the Washington region’s busiest transit hub — connecting Amtrak, Metro, Virginia Railway Express, Maryland MARC commuter trains and intercity and local buses. “Union Station is really at the epicenter of the District’s plan for the 21st century,” former mayor Anthony A. Williams said recently, calling the redevelopment plan an opportunity to reach for “something very special.” That something special doesn’t have to be a magnet for drivers, D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) said in a letter to the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which held its first review of the proposal on Jan. 9. The project as proposed, Allen said, overbuilds parking. “While I appreciate that the preferred alternative does contemplate fewer parking spaces than in the current garage, I believe parking must be even further reduced at this dense, urban transit hub,” he said. Parking would be reduced to 1,575 spots from the existing 2,200 under the FRA’s preferred construction option. This parking inventory would be in line with what is available in stations in Philadelphia and Boston, according to an analysis by the NCPC. New York’s Penn Station, however, and other stations across the United States and the world do not have on-site parking. Having parking, critics say, discourages commuters from using transit. According to the NCPC report, nearly 1,400 of the 2,200 parking spots available at the Union Station garage are used by monthly parkers, meaning the parking isn’t serving train riders or people frequenting the terminal’s retail stores. Beverley Swaim-Staley, president and chief executive of the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation, said the parking number in the proposal is based on estimates from traffic studies and current parking usage. It makes assumptions of reduced parking needs by monthly parkers in the future. But she said the number is not set in stone and the group will continue to work with the city, community and developers to find the right parking approach as the project moves forward. “We want to make sure that we have sufficient parking if we all agree that parking is necessary,” she said. “But we are still trying to figure out what the parking needs will be.” David Valenstein, a senior adviser at the FRA and the project leader, said the agency is working closely with District agencies to develop a good traffic circulation plan that’s responsive to traffic concerns. He said parking is viewed as essential to having “equitable access” at the terminal. The proposed parking structure, he said, will accommodate rental cars as well as short-term and long-term parking at the station complex, Valenstein told the NCPC on Jan. 9. In the future, he said, the parking might accommodate autonomous vehicles “that will need to be readily available at the station.” The draft of an environmental-impact statement set to be released this spring will lay out the parking needs and overall project impacts. After a comment period, the FRA is expected to release a final recommendation. That would be a final step in the federal review process to move the project forward. The realization of the plan, however, may take decades. Once the federal approval process is complete, there will be “an extensive” design phase that is likely to take several years before construction, Swaim-Staley said. Financing is still lacking for the multibillion-dollar project. Proponents say they anticipate construction will be done in phases and require multiple sources of funding, including government funding commitments. Meanwhile, planners are busy finalizing the project concept that includes an east-west train hall, an access zone for pedestrians and skylights between H Street NE and the train hall, pedestrian and bicycle access improvements and improved pickup and drop-off areas for vehicles, new concourses and platforms and extended tracks. And the 1,575-spot parking garage above a newly built bus facility. Amtrak, one of the project’s proponents, said while it supports all improvements to enhance the customer experience, parking is not essential to its operations at Union Station. “We encourage our customers to travel to the station through modes other than private vehicle to park,” spokeswoman Kimberly Woods said. In the coming months and years, more discussions are likely about traffic impacts and the station’s future parking needs, including whether any parking should be above or below ground, the latter a preferred option but one that could be challenging and costly to build. “We should build the community that we want and what we want is one that encourages other modes of transportation, gives people other options and doesn’t encourage more travel by car,” Courtney said. luz.lazo@washpost.com	825	"[{""start"": 1971, ""end"": 2093, ""text"": ""Union Station gets about 40 million visitors each year and is served by 85 to 90 intercity Amtrak trains on any given day."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2094, ""end"": 2263, ""text"": ""t is also the Washington region’s busiest transit hub — connecting Amtrak, Metro, Virginia Railway Express, Maryland MARC commuter trains and intercity and local buses."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2264, ""end"": 2351, ""text"": ""“Union Station is really at the epicenter of the District’s plan for the 21st century,”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	815	2023-05-02T11:53:32.758646Z	2023-05-02T11:53:32.758755Z	666.326
On one side is NoMa, a bustling new employment center with a catchy name, home to National Public Radio, CNN and the Justice Department. On the other side is H Street Northeast, perhaps the buzziest corridor in the city for nightlife and restaurants, and the future site of Whole Foods. After decades of decline, development is booming on all sides of Union Station, and now the station itself could become the anchor for Washington’s next go-to spot. A D.C. developer is making a big bet on the railyard behind it, proposing to build a deck over the tracks to support a commercial and residential hub that would unite the neighborhood behind the station for the first time in 100 years. READ: Reimagining Union Station From its offices across the street, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., along with Amtrak and its partners, is studying every inch of the station to prepare its pitch to the policymakers and investors needed to make the master plan a reality. What’s there now The area around Union Station has been growing more racially diverse and prosperous. While some new apartments, government and commercial buildings ring the station, neighborhoods of historic homes are just a few blocks away. Year built Commercial and offices Residential and hotels A changing neighborhood In 1990, 75 percent of the people who lived within a mile of Union Station were black. Now, whites make up 44 percent of the area’s populaton, and the share of Asians and Hispanics is also growing. Poverty and education In 2012, 61 percent of the area’s inhabitants had a bachelor’s degree, compared with 29 percent for the rest of the United States. Sources: D.C. Office of the Chief Financial Officer, NoMa Business Improvement District, Post analysis of U.S. census data. Published Sept. 12, 2014. Link directly to this graphic More than two years after Amtrak unveiled its plan for the station, central obstacles remain: Congress cannot agree on how to spend annual transportation dollars, and the Obama administration is struggling to get rail legislation passed. And the D.C. real estate market, for all its new apartments and restaurants, is producing little demand for office space, a primary financial driver for Burnham Place, the envisioned 3 million square-foot mixed-use mega-project. Karen Hedlund, a top-ranking official at the Federal Railroad Administration, argues that something larger is afoot that will overwhelm cyclical budget constraints and real estate downturns — that Americans are making a generational return to cities and to rail travel as they spurn highways overwhelmed by congestion. “By 2050 our country is going to have 100 million more people that we are going to have to move around,” she said, “and the economists believe that a majority of this population growth is going to be in cities or metropolitan areas.” Skeptics point to the difficulty of finding the political will to enact a plan that could cost more than $10 billion. But Hedlund said that for people to move freely up and down the Northeast corridor, there is no other way. “The alternative is double-decking Interstate 95,” she said. “There just is no more space.” Working behind the scenes How do you get to $10 billion? The model may be at another Union Station, in Denver, another fast-growing city. Though much smaller in scale and cost, the $488 million redevelopment of the Denver station offered a 22-bay bus concourse and expanded train connections when it was completed in May. The lion’s share of the cost — $87.3 million in grants and $300.6 million in loans — came from the Transportation Department, but Hedlund said proceeds from some 2 million square feet of expected mixed-use development around the station is expected to reimburse the federal government. “Those loans made to Denver are being paid for from proceeds of that development,” she said. The Obama administration would like to open a much larger flow of money for such projects, by way of its proposed Grow America Act, a four-year, $302 billion transportation bill. Instead, Congress and Obama patched together an extension to the Highway Trust Fund using a budgetary gimmick. To put together a more diverse pool of funding sources, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp. (USRC), which manages the station, is working closely with Amtrak, the Transportation Department, developer Akridge and the Federal City Council (an association of local business executives) to evaluate precisely what work is needed and how much it will cost. In the process, USRC has collected 8,000 documents about the station, everything it could find from storage, District agencies, the Library of Congress and historians. All the partners decide what to study and who will pay for it, and they all had a hand in working with the D.C. government to approve funding needed to shore up the H Street bridge that passes behind the station. The partnership will need to hold together over time, as greater sums of money are needed to build each new phase of a generational project. In the meantime, Amtrak and the USRC are trying to build support by offering interim improvements to the station’s more than 100,000 daily visitors, among them a new bus terminal, freshly repaired gold leafing on the ceiling of the main hall and an updated public address system. “People don’t have to wait until well into the future to see the start of improvements,” said Beverley Swaim-Staley, the group’s president and chief executive. Real estate headwinds Akridge, the D.C. real estate firm founded by John “Chip” Akridge, has committed to assembling $1.5 billion in private funds toward developing Burnham Place, the most ambitious project in the company’s 40-year history. Since its founding, the company has had tried to acquire properties in the path of development, Akridge said, and that was the idea when he agreed to buy the development rights over the tracks, at a 2002 auction, for just $10 million. Only three developers bid for the project. Union Station was on the decline, and the surrounding neighborhood wasn’t much better. A streetcar hadn’t even been proposed. “NoMa was a wasteland 12 years ago,” Akridge said. “H Street was even worse.” Since then, progress “could not have been more positive,” he said. With all the new development in the area — Douglas Development has even begun rehabbing the Uline Arena, made famous by a 1964 visit from the Beatles — Akridge now expects Burnham Place to be the hole in the doughnut, one with better train access than any other site. “We had no concept of what we see today, which is that Union Station is probably going to become the regional transportation hub in the Northeast corridor,” he said. But the endeavor entails more uncertainty than most development projects. Akridge will have to front the capital for the deck years ahead of when it will see any return on that investment, and he isn’t sure of the price tag yet. “You have to build the infrastructure upfront,” said Bob Murphy, managing principal at MRP Realty, a competing firm that just completed a 14-story, 400-unit apartment in NoMa. “If they are going to build that entire platform, they are going to have to have the money so that they can afford to carry it.” Despite interest in the area, there are signs that the boom is waning. Rents at apartment buildings in neighborhoods like NoMa have begun to drop. Meanwhile, sequestration and defense spending cuts have taken a toll on the office market, which is Akridge’s bread and butter. Few companies are expanding, and those that are are leasing smaller offices, thanks to a push toward more efficient work spaces. The vacancy rate downtown is 11.2 percent, barely down from 2009, according to the services firm Cassidy Turley. Office rents have been flat for five years. The storm clouds are dark enough that Gerry Widdicombe, director of economic development for the Downtown Business Improvement District, thinks some office owners will have to convert their buildings to housing. “We hear more and more from office guys that we’re going to do residential,” he said. “The office market is going sideways in a big way. No one knows really where it’s going.” Millions of square feet of new offices are scheduled to arrive on the market before Burnham Place. Given the complexities of the master plan, Akridge will not be able to control the timing of his project as well as others. But the first building at Burnham Place isn’t likely to be completed for at least five years, long enough for the market to roar back. And Akridge said there is already growing demand for efficient, light-filled work spaces providing less space per worker, which only newer buildings can provide. “You can’t squeeze somebody into 125 square feet per person in a building built before 2013,” he said. Who will lead the charge? There are other tools available to the Union Station organizers, among them a surcharge on Amtrak tickets and a special tax on commercial properties around Union Station. Getting any of them approved, however, would require some visible political muscle. Who is up to the task? A new mayor could play a key role. D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), the Democratic mayoral nominee, submitted a bill late last year calling for the creation of an Office of Public Private Partnerships, aimed at raising hundreds of millions of capital dollars. A more likely candidate may be a former mayor, Anthony A. Williams. As president of the Federal City Council, Williams holds one of five seats on the USRC board. Before he arrived, the organization played major roles in quietly pushing school reform and redeveloping libraries across the District. Though he declined to be interviewed, Williams is widely expected to make Union Station a top priority. He has hired Emeka Moneme, a former Metro official and director of the D.C. Department of Transportation, to oversee infrastructure projects. Williams made a spirited speech at the unveiling of Amtrak’s master plan. And he was talking about how best to fund public infrastructure years before Bowser’s bill; in a 2012 keynote speech at the city’s annual economic development luncheon, Williams called for a public infrastructure fund akin to the one Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) now deploys. Few Washingtonians enjoy the connections that Williams does to Capitol Hill, the District government and private sector executives. Swaim-Staley says anytime she needs something, Williams is there for her: “He has been a champion of the project. He has been terrific. I can’t say enough.” Hedlund echoed that sentiment: “He’s been very active.”	824	"[{""start"": 287, ""end"": 450, ""text"": ""After decades of decline, development is booming on all sides of Union Station, and now the station itself could become the anchor for Washington’s next go-to spot"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2608, ""end"": 2709, ""text"": ""By 2050 our country is going to have 100 million more people that we are going to have to move aroun"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 558, ""end"": 686, ""text"": ""to support a commercial and residential hub that would unite the neighborhood behind the station for the first time in 100 years"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2480, ""end"": 2605, ""text"": ""that Americans are making a generational return to cities and to rail travel as they spurn highways overwhelmed by congestion"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	814	2023-05-02T11:42:23.951083Z	2023-05-02T11:42:23.951153Z	569.168
The concourse at Washington’s Union Station will undergo a makeover beginning in the fall, a project that will double its capacity, relieve crowding and make for a more accessible and comfortable customer experience, Amtrak says. In addition to providing a modern and brighter space for the 100,000 daily intercity, commuter and local travelers who pass through Union Station, the work also will improve access between Amtrak’s concourse and the mezzanine of the Metro station there. “We will increase capacity, circulation and accessibility,” Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods said. The railroad is in the process of selecting a general contractor for the project, which will be done in phases over three years to reduce the impact on travelers and station retailers. The work is part of a larger plan to remake Washington’s main railroad station to double train and passenger capacity over the next two decades. Amtrak declined to provide a cost estimate for the concourse improvements, citing the integrity of the open bidding process. The larger vision, known as Washington Union Station’s 2nd Century plan, which includes multiple projects over 20 years, is based on a 2012 master plan for Union Station that set the cost of the massive expansion and improvement at $7 billion. The revitalization of Union Station is an important piece in Amtrak’s vision for the Northeast — the nation’s busiest rail corridor — which includes faster trains that could increase ridership between Washington and Boston. It’s even more critical as new private ventures vie to compete for the traveling public, whose numbers continue to grow and which is more frustrated by unreliable and antiquated service. In the Washington region, for example, a group of private investors is exploring bringing the high-speed maglev train to the region, including putting a station about a mile from Union Station at Mount Vernon Square. The concourse expansion will follow an economic boom in the neighborhoods surrounding the historic rail hub, including new commercial and residential development in the NoMa neighborhood to the north, a thriving commercial corridor on H Street NE to the east, and the construction of three new city blocks at Capitol Crossing to the west. It also comes as talks get serious about expanding rail capacity over the Potomac River, including a proposal to add more tracks to the two-track Long Bridge, which would make it possible to increase passenger service in the region. Additional tracks would allow “through service” in which Virginia trains could continue north of Union Station to Maryland and Maryland trains could continue south over the Potomac. Railroad and other officials and advocates say the improvements are necessary to ensure Union Station keeps up with the growth. The station, which opened in 1907, operates at capacity and is inadequate for existing and future demands, officials say. “Ridership continues to soar, resulting in long and crowded areas of departing customers that routinely impede the public concourse, blocking flows and diminishing a fluid travel experience,” Woods said. “With conservative projections doubling ridership at Union Station by 2033, implementing near-term solutions to gain capacity is imperative to maintain safe and efficient station operations.” Upgrades to the Claytor Concourse — a 70,000-square-foot space named after former Amtrak president William Graham Claytor Jr. — include opening up the space to create additional areas for boarding and queuing, which would help reduce chaos as passengers line up at the gate to board. There will be new restrooms, and the area will be brightened with natural light. ClubAcela, an exclusive passenger lounge area, will be rebranded as Metropolitan Lounge and rebuilt to include additional seating options and provide a more modern space for first-class travelers and single-day pass holders. Amtrak’s support spaces at the First Street level also would be renovated. Other infrastructure improvements include upgrades and relocation of mechanical and electrical equipment and a new emergency generator. “These improvements are sorely needed,” said Stephen A. Hansen, chair of the Committee of 100 on the Federal City, a nonprofit that has been lobbying for the preservation of the station. “It’s a modern building. It’s got modern uses and needs,” Hansen said. “A building that doesn’t adapt disappears. This is what’s exciting about Union Station. It is adapting, it will adapt, and we just hope and expect that its historic integrity is protected throughout the process.” Metro’s portion of the project will include a major facelift to its station that is accessed through the ground level of Union Station. In addition to improvements to the mezzanine, the plan calls for the installation of a new stairway to connect the mezzanine to the concourse, a new entrance from First Street NE and the expansion of the fare gate area. Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said the changes are the result of years of planning to improve access and relieve congestion at Union Station, the busiest entry point into the Metro system with more than 28,000 daily entries, many of which are transfers from commuter rail, intercity rail and bus systems. “Once complete, Metro riders will have quicker, easier access to enter/exit the station and better connect to the Union Station concourse,” Ly said in an email. “Not only will this save time, but the increased capacity will allow for future ridership growth.” The concourse built in the 1980s is immediately adjacent to the historic station. If the procurement process goes as planned, a contractor would be picked in the summer, and construction could begin in the fall, according to Amtrak. luz.lazo@washpost.com	838	"[{""start"": 91, ""end"": 228, ""text"": ""a project that will double its capacity, relieve crowding and make for a more accessible and comfortable customer experience, Amtrak say"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 230, ""end"": 483, ""text"": ""In addition to providing a modern and brighter space for the 100,000 daily intercity, commuter and local travelers who pass through Union Station, the work also will improve access between Amtrak’s concourse and the mezzanine of the Metro station there."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 484, ""end"": 543, ""text"": ""“We will increase capacity, circulation and accessibility,”"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 769, ""end"": 912, ""text"": ""The work is part of a larger plan to remake Washington’s main railroad station to double train and passenger capacity over the next two decades"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2828, ""end"": 2914, ""text"": ""operates at capacity and is inadequate for existing and future demands, officials say."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2916, ""end"": 3118, ""text"": ""Ridership continues to soar, resulting in long and crowded areas of departing customers that routinely impede the public concourse, blocking flows and diminishing a fluid travel experience,” Woods said."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 5403, ""end"": 5499, ""text"": ""“Not only will this save time, but the increased capacity will allow for future ridership growth"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2828, ""end"": 2914, ""text"": ""perates at capacity and is inadequate for existing and future demands, officials say."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	813	2023-05-02T11:32:51.812495Z	2023-05-02T11:32:51.812563Z	85.796
Rider Ranga Nathan wants to know why Metro doesn’t do something about crowding at Union Station. He takes a MARC train from his home in Maryland to Union Station before getting on the Red Line and then an Orange Line train to work in Rosslyn. When he passes through Union Station again on his way home, the line for the escalator to get from the platform up to the concourse level to get his connection is “so large sometimes I have missed the connecting MARC train,” he told us in an email. “What I don’t understand is how come the Metro management has not addressed this problem. Union Station is such an important place and one would think they would expand the entry and exits from Metro to Union Station,” he said. Well, some relief is coming, though not as much as Metro and Amtrak consultants had said is possible. A few days after Nathan wrote, Metro and Amtrak announced that Amtrak is seeking bids from contractors for a major renovation of the busy 112-year-old station. According to The Washington Post, Amtrak’s portion of the three-year project involves opening up the 70,000-square-foot Claytor Concourse to expand the area where the rail line’s passengers line up to board. New restrooms will be added, the area will be brightened with natural light, and the ClubAcela passenger lounge area will be expanded and rebranded as Metropolitan Lounge. Metro’s portion of the project includes installing a new stairway connecting the mezzanine, where fare gates are located, to the concourse. A 2011 study on improving access and capacity at the station said the stairs would ease the backup of people like Nathan getting off trains and trying to go upstairs to the concourse. The plan also calls for creating a bigger entrance to the station from First Avenue Northeast and more space inside. At the moment, a narrow entrance in a stone wall leads to a cramped area, where a people trying to get in and out of the station get tangled with people waiting to take backed-up escalators. The plan also calls for adding more fare gates. Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said Metro could still decide to do more. But not included in the request for bids was the addition of two elevators between the mezzanine and the concourse. In addition to the stairs, the 2011 study said adding the elevators would reduce congestion even more and “provide multiple path choices for pedestrians traveling across three levels.” Even in 2011, the study said Union Station had gotten too crowded and would get even worse. The transformation of surrounding neighborhoods like the thriving H Street Northeast corridor had increased daily train boardings from 5,000 when the station opened to 35,000. At that time, more than 5,000 pedestrians were using the north mezzanine by the First Avenue Northeast entrance in the mornings and another 6,000 used it in the afternoon rush hour. However, more development in the area, the addition of the H Street streetcar, and other changes were expected to increase pedestrian traffic by 60 percent by 2031. The addition of more full-length, 10-car trains would also mean more people getting off on crowded platforms with each train, making the backup on the escalators even worse.

Amtrak plans to begin building a new $50 million Union Station concourse this summer that it said would double the space for passengers and improve circulation throughout the station by 2019. Union Station passengers have long complained that the waiting area for trains there, the second busiest in the country for the rail service, is dark, cramped and difficult to maneuver. Despite the proximity to train tracks, some the station’s 37 million annual passengers have difficulty knowing which direction to head to catch their train or make connections to commuter lines, Metro, buses, taxis or the new D.C. Streetcar. In a design Amtrak released Tuesday, the station’s north wall on the concourse level will be pushed back to add another 20,000 square feet of space and bring new restrooms, boarding gates, seating, an Amtrak police station and ClubAcela lounge. Passengers would be able to look out on the train tracks through a glass wall. Built in 1907, Union Station was redeveloped in the late 1980s and is now subject of a long-term master plan that would dramatically increase rail capacity and create a new development above the tracks, called Burnham Place. [Reimagining Union Station] The concourse improvements represent a more immediate way to improve passengers’ experience that will work in concert with the bigger plans. Amtrak’s Stephen Gardner, executive vice president, said in a release that the new space will “vastly improve passenger comfort and accessibility with a modern and reconfigured concourse area benefiting Amtrak, VRE and MARC passengers.” “This work and other planned improvements will transform Union Station’s capacity and performance, befitting the vital regional gateway and civic hub the Station has become since its redevelopment in 1988,” Gardner said. Work will begin this summer, as crews begin to move mechanical systems that are located in the concourse area. Train service is not expected to be affected, said Amtrak’s David Zaidain, who oversees the project. Construction on the full plan will begin in the spring of next year with completion in 2019 or 2020, meaning before passengers get to enjoy the new concourse they will have to endure two-to-three years worth of hard hats and dust. Zaidain estimated the price tag at $40 million to $50 million, most of the money coming from Amtrak’s budget. A main reason for the cramped conditions in the first place is the concourse’s position beneath a parking garage and taxi access road, giving the station’s architects and engineers, from KGP Design Studio, Grimshaw Architect and ARUP, limited space in which to work. “This space is extremely constrictive on all levels for what we’re trying to do,” Zaidain said. But he assured passengers it would be worth the wait. “We just want to provide a more pleasant experience for everyone,” he said.

When Nick Smith was a student at Gonzaga College High School in the District, the school allowed students to leave campus at lunch time to go elsewhere to eat. But even though the school’s campus, on Eye Street Northwest, was only a few blocks from Union Station, he rarely remembers going there. “There just wasn’t much there,” he said. “There was no activity around the station really.” That was 30 years ago, but for many Washingtonians, that perception remains. Although interest in rail travel has soared during the past decade as hordes of young professionals returned to inner city neighborhoods, Union Station remains much as it did following renovations in the mid-1980s. With its ownership and management sliced among more than a dozen federal and local government agencies, the Daniel Burnham-designed landmark remains an important transportation hub for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but one where the growing crowds cram its dated corridors, concourses, stairwells and elevators. Though it is the second-most trafficked train station in the country, it still struggles to attract shoppers beyond those passing through on their way to another destination, whether via Amtrak, commuter rail, Metro, regional bus or taxi. A new generation of plans — some under way, some still on the drawing board — would upgrade nearly every part of the station and maximize the building’s historic bones for both commuters and out-of-towners. The plans are accompanied by hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate investment pouring into surrounding neighborhoods, with office towers rapidly climbing in the “NoMa” neighborhood north of Massachusetts Avenue, and H Street Northeast becoming a trendy late-night spot for the 20-something crowd. The District government plans to open a streetcar line that would run along H Street and connect to the station’s northern end. Betting on the future Today, Smith is chief investment officer for First Potomac Realty Trust, owner of more than $2 billion of commercial real estate. He and his company are betting big on the neighborhood he once wandered as a teenager. Until a few years ago, Bethesda-based First Potomac focused on industrial and office properties in the area’s outer suburbs and exurbs, as far south as Virginia Beach. With the revitalization of urban areas, however, it quickly changed its focus, making 23 investments totaling $746.6 million in inner Washington area neighborhoods between 2009 and this past August, when First Potomac and a partner purchased the Greyhound bus station for $46.8 million. It now owns about $250 million worth of real estate within a few blocks of Union Station, including 440 and 500 First St. NW, and 840 First St. NE. “The draw that we had initially to the neighborhood was the U.S. Capitol. Of course it’s a big employment driver over there,” Smith said. But as Smith and his colleagues looked more closely, they realized that companies looking for space in the area were focused on being close to transit. “What we found when we were sniffing around, when we were doing more investigation on that neighborhood, is that Union Station is really the hub for all the activities there,” Smith said. “The tenants love it for all the amenities that it has.” Doug Firstenberg, whose development company, StonebridgeCarras, is one of the biggest developers in NoMa, said that investors new to the area considered Union Station a fundamental strength that would add value regardless of other market conditions. He attracted the headquarters of the Justice Department and a Harris Teeter grocery store to his project, Constitution Square. “I think for people who were cautious about our vision, I think what they were always thinking was worst case, we’ve always got Union Station,” he said. Traffic at the station is booming. Amtrak reported 4.9 million boardings there in its 2011 fiscal year, up 6.1 percent from the previous year. The Metro station is the most popular in the system, with an average of 33,697 passenger boardings as of last June. Approximately 70,000 people now pass through every day. Metro, intercity bus companies and the city, with its streetcar plans, are all working to improve frustrating passenger connections. Hanging over all the short-term changes is a master plan being drawn up by Amtrak for its holdings in the station and the tracks behind it, of which it does not plan to release details for at least a month. In the meantime the rail operator has begun making smaller improvements. It already installed 60 electronic signs showing train arrival and departure information and, in partnership with Union Station Redevelopment, plans a new $1.4 million public address system, a new $400,000 ticket counter and a new $120,000 customer service office. Multiple stakeholders Nearly any change at Union Station requires multiple signatures and approvals from either city or federal officials, and reaching consensus can be tricky. Take Columbus Circle, the traffic plaza outside the station’s front door that is being rebuilt to improve security, better serve car traffic and improve accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Columbus Circle area has at least six stakeholders: Land immediately outside the circle is controlled by Architect of the Capitol, but the row of flag poles along its outer edge are controlled by the National Park Service. Massachusetts Avenue is under the purview of the city’s department of transportation, but the three traffic lanes directly in front of the station are controlled by the Transportation Department and leased to the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., which then subleased the rights to New York-based Ashkenazy Acquisition. Amtrak is contributing to the cost of the new security measures. David S. Ball, president of Union Station Redevelopment, says the partners work in concert with one another. He points out that the organization, created by Congress in 1981 to preserve and revitalize the station, has board members from Amtrak, the city, the federal government and a private group, the Federal City Council. “As we go forward the next 100 years, we’ve got to make sure that this building that sits on the footstep of the U.S. Capitol, serves as the entry point for the U.S. Capitol,” he said. Ball has been at the helm since 1994, but it has not been all smooth sailing. Ashkenazy bought the rights to the station’s retail near the peak of the real estate market, in 2007, only to watch as the D.C. Council passed legislation authorizing the city’s chief financial officer to tax privately leased space within federal facilities, adding a more than $1 million tax bill to its lease payments. In 2010, Ball asked the council to forgo $33.5 million in payments through 2035, but the required legislation failed to win passage. Ball’s group subsequently filed suit against the city — which funded more than a quarter of the 1980s renovations and holds one of five seats on its board. In the meantime, the redevelopment corporation is not paying taxes and owed $6.6 million in taxes, interest and penalties for 2008-2010 period. Ball and Ashkenazy declined to discuss their tax debt or the lawsuit. But questions about the stewardship of the station are likely to return with a coming audit by the Transportation Department’s Inspector General, required by federal legislation sponsored by the District’s delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D). “Union Station needs more than an annual financial statement to assure Congress and the public that one of the nation’s most historic and productive facilities is up for the enormous challenges it now faces,” Norton said in a February statement. Ball said he has not yet been contacted by the inspector general, but knows it’s coming. “Ms. Norton is my congresswoman. I am a resident of Washington, D.C. She has some very strong ideas about what the Union Station progress should be,” he said. “We’re very confident and comfortable with where we are.”	835	"[{""start"": 466, ""end"": 602, ""text"": ""Although interest in rail travel has soared during the past decade as hordes of young professionals returned to inner city neighborhoods"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 995, ""end"": 1232, ""text"": ""Though it is the second-most trafficked train station in the country, it still struggles to attract shoppers beyond those passing through on their way to another destination, whether via Amtrak, commuter rail, Metro, regional bus or taxi"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3112, ""end"": 3193, ""text"": ""s that Union Station is really the hub for all the activities there,” Smith said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3368, ""end"": 3501, ""text"": ""investors new to the area considered Union Station a fundamental strength that would add value regardless of other market conditions."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3782, ""end"": 3815, ""text"": ""Traffic at the station is booming"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3817, ""end"": 3924, ""text"": ""Amtrak reported 4.9 million boardings there in its 2011 fiscal year, up 6.1 percent from the previous year."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}]"	26	809	2023-05-02T10:52:07.906679Z	2023-05-02T10:52:07.906806Z	524.842
"Updated 4:12 p.m. Ronald Reagan's name is already on the name of a local airport, so why not also name the train station for a former president? That's what Missouri Sens. Claire McCaskill (D) and Roy Blunt (R) hope to do as they introduced a measure Thursday that would rename Washington's Union Station for former president Harry S. Truman. The bill's introduction is timed to Truman's 130th birthday, which is today. The proposal to rename the District's main train hub for an out-of-town resident might bring pause to some locals. On Thursday afternoon, D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), who has taken pains to fight Congress for greater budget and governing autonomy, issued a statement saying the District ought to have some say. ""Any name change should be made in collaboration and consultation with the residents and government of the District of Columbia,"" he said. But Union Station is owned by the federal government, so Congress has the right to name the station whatever it wants. McCaskill and Blunt both serve on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over such proposals. So why name Union Station for Truman? The senators noted that the station once housed U.S. Car No. 1, or the presidential rail car, which Truman used for his  ""whistle-stop campaign"" tour, which started and ended at Union Station. Once Truman left town in 1953, he departed Washington from Union Station by train, and 5,000 people showed up to say goodbye, according to the senators. The proposal is an especially important one for McCaskill, whose office is decorated with a Truman bust, photos of the late president and even a ""The Buck Stops Here"" name plate on her desk. She said Thursday that she wanted to give Truman the honor because while several sites in Washington are named for former presidents, nothing is named for Truman. ""I hear Republicans all the time comparing themselves to Harry Truman. So I figured, with so many people wanting to grab Harry Truman’s mantle, this could turn into a great bipartisan effort,"" she said. Despite McCaskill's suggestion, the main building housing the State Department in Washington is named for Truman. McCaskill credited the former president for a ""plain-spoken and straight-forward"" approach. ""He wasn’t concerned about his approval ratings. He recognized Israel, he integrated the armed services. When he integrated the armed services it was a terribly unpopular thing to do but it was the right thing to do and he didn’t care what the approval ratings said,"" she said. Acknowledging that some critics might be concerned about naming the train station for the first U.S. president to order the use of an atomic bomb, McCaskill said, ""He saved thousands of lives by making that decision, it was a very difficult decision it was obviously horrific that that happened, but I think most historians would weigh in and say that the decision was made to save lives, not take lives."" The sprawling train station houses roughly 140 shops and restaurants and is in the midst of a $35 million renovation that will reposition its merchant mix with a concentration on food options -- a big need in an area of town near famous landmarks but devoid of affordable eating options for tourists. The station has also become a major bus hub and is home to one  of the Metro system's most well-used subway stops. In 2012, Amtrak proposed a $7 billion expansion of the station that it said could triple passenger capacity and transform the overcrowded station into a high-speed rail hub. More recent renovations include repairs of damage caused by the 2011 earthquake and the addition of new stores such as H&M. But the station and its manager, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., have not always enjoyed sound financial footing. The nonprofit USRC sued the city in 2011 over a tax dispute, and, last month, an audit by the Department of Transportation's inspector general found that a USRC maintenance fund was in danger of facing a $5 million shortfall by this fall. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D.C.), who requested the audit, said it showed that USRC ""has many major problems for which solutions have not been developed."" Beverley Swaim-Staley, president and chief executive of USRC, said the capital maintenance fund was just one source of revenue for the organization and that the shortfall resulted from a long-term lease USRC had signed years before. “It’s easy now to say, 'wow, it’s a very successful retail space, and it’s a hot neighborhood,' but that’s not what it was when the lease was signed,"" she said when the report came out. Swaim-Staley declined to comment on the name proposal on Thursday. ""Since the building is owned by USDOT, it is really a discussion for them,"" she said in an e-mail. Jonathan O’Connell contributed to this report."	834	"[{""start"": 3264, ""end"": 3377, ""text"": ""The station has also become a major bus hub and is home to one  of the Metro system's most well-used subway stops"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3388, ""end"": 3551, ""text"": ""Amtrak proposed a $7 billion expansion of the station that it said could triple passenger capacity and transform the overcrowded station into a high-speed rail hub"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3553, ""end"": 3675, ""text"": ""More recent renovations include repairs of damage caused by the 2011 earthquake and the addition of new stores such as H&M"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3677, ""end"": 3797, ""text"": ""ut the station and its manager, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., have not always enjoyed sound financial footing."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3677, ""end"": 3796, ""text"": ""But the station and its manager, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., have not always enjoyed sound financial footing"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}, {""start"": 3876, ""end"": 4036, ""text"": ""an audit by the Department of Transportation's inspector general found that a USRC maintenance fund was in danger of facing a $5 million shortfall by this fall."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 3876, ""end"": 4036, ""text"": ""an audit by the Department of Transportation's inspector general found that a USRC maintenance fund was in danger of facing a $5 million shortfall by this fall."", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	808	2023-05-02T10:43:21.390840Z	2023-05-02T10:43:21.390963Z	144.26
That depressing side entrance to Union Station’s Metro platform may soon get a face-lift. The Metro board’s committee on capital projects and real estate is expected to approve a plan to rebuild the entrance to Union Station on First Street NE, part of an effort to alleviate crowding that has clogged up the mezzanine level of the Metro station in recent years. The $5 million project would add additional fare gates and a new staircase to the entrance to the Metro station, which experiences the most daily foot traffic of any station in the system. The project would also bring expansive windows, a sleek glass-and-steel canopy and a new pedestrian ramp to the First Street entrance — a dramatic change from the current entrance, a dimly lit cutout in the fortress-like of stone wall that doesn’t do much to brighten the barren, windswept thoroughfare. In a presentation to the Metro board released in advance of a Thursday meeting, Metro officials said the District and Maryland have agreed to reimburse the cost of the project, which would be tacked onto an another project that’s already in the works at Union Station — a redesign of the Amtrak concourse. The concourse project is scheduled to be put out to bid later this year, and would be completed by 2020. The plan to expand the entrance into the Metro station has been in the works for a decade; back in 2011, a report on capacity and access issues at Union Station warned that Metro’s facilities were already reaching untenable levels of crowding and congestion. “Without major capacity enhancements, Metrorail‘s north mezzanine at Union Station would be unable to accommodate the anticipated growth, leading to congested travel conditions for customers and impacting all transportation services at Union Station,” the report said. More recently, the problem has gotten worse, with long lines forming as passengers wait to pass through the fare gates on their way in and out of the station. And it doesn’t help that Union Station is frequented by tourists who linger on the mezzanine level as they consult maps and fiddle with the fare vending machine. If the Metro board’s real estate committee approves the measure, it will go to the full board. After that, Metro staff will be able to finalize a deal with Washington, Maryland, Amtrak, and the Union Station Redevelopment Corp. to execute the project.	833	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 54, ""text"": ""hat depressing side entrance to Union Station’s Metro"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 245, ""end"": 361, ""text"": ""part of an effort to alleviate crowding that has clogged up the mezzanine level of the Metro station in recent year"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1358, ""end"": 1525, ""text"": ""back in 2011, a report on capacity and access issues at Union Station warned that Metro’s facilities were already reaching untenable levels of crowding and congestion."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1527, ""end"": 1793, ""text"": ""Without major capacity enhancements, Metrorail‘s north mezzanine at Union Station would be unable to accommodate the anticipated growth, leading to congested travel conditions for customers and impacting all transportation services at Union Station,” the report said"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 1795, ""end"": 2115, ""text"": ""More recently, the problem has gotten worse, with long lines forming as passengers wait to pass through the fare gates on their way in and out of the station.

Ronald Reagan’s name is already on a Washington area airport, so why not also name the train station for a former president? That’s what Missouri Sens. Claire McCaskill (D) and Roy Blunt (R) proposed Thursday in a bill that would rename Washington’s Union Station for former president Harry S. Truman, who would have marked his 130th birthday on Thursday. Naming the District’s train hub for an out-of-towner might give pause among locals, but Union Station, like many other large buildings in the city, is owned by the federal government, so Congress has naming rights. McCaskill and Blunt serve on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which has jurisdiction over such proposals. D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D), who has fought Congress for greater budget and governing autonomy, issued a statement saying the District ought to have some say. “Any name change should be made in collaboration and consultation with the residents and government of the District of Columbia,” he said. But Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) issued a statement applauding the idea to add Truman’s name to the station so long as “Union Station” remained a part of it. “From integrating the armed forces and the Marshall Plan to the Fair Deal and the creation of the United Nations, Harry Truman was one of our nation’s greatest presidents and deserves recognition in the nation’s capital,” she said in the statement. McCaskill said she wanted to give Truman the honor because no site in Washington carried the Truman name. “I hear Republicans all the time comparing themselves to Harry Truman. So I figured, with so many people wanting to grab Harry Truman’s mantle, this could turn into a great bipartisan effort,” she said. She may have forgotten that the main building housing the State Department in Washington is named for Truman. The proposal is an especially important one for McCaskill, whose office is decorated with a Truman bust, photos of the late president and even a name plate of Truman’s oft-quoted slogan, “The Buck Stops Here.” She cited several reasons for giving Truman the honor: Union Station once housed U.S. Car No. 1, or the presidential rail car, which Truman used for campaigning and other out-of-town trips. Acknowledging that some critics might be concerned about naming the train station for the first U.S. president to order the use of an atomic bomb, McCaskill said, “He saved thousands of lives by making that decision, it was a very difficult decision, it was obviously horrific that that happened, but I think most historians would weigh in and say that the decision was made to save lives, not take lives.” The sprawling train station houses about 140 shops and restaurants and is undergoing a $35 million renovation that will allow for several more restaurants. In 2012, Amtrak proposed a $7 billion expansion of the station that it said could triple passenger capacity and transform the overcrowded site into a high-speed rail hub. But the station and its manager, Union Station Redevelopment Corp., have not always enjoyed sound financial footing. The nonprofit manager sued the city in 2011 over a tax dispute, and an audit by the Department of Transportation’s inspector general released last month found that a USRC maintenance fund was in danger of facing a $5 million shortfall by this fall. Norton, who requested the audit, said it showed that USRC “has many major problems for which solutions have not been developed.” Beverley Swaim-Staley, president and chief executive of USRC, said the capital maintenance fund was just one source of revenue for the organization and that the shortfall resulted from a long-term lease USRC had signed years before. Swaim-Staley declined to comment on the name proposal on Thursday. “Since the building is owned by USDOT, it is really a discussion for them,” she said in an e-mail. jonathan.occonnell@washpost.com	832	"[{""start"": 2974, ""end"": 3089, ""text"": ""ut the station and its manager, Union Station Redevelopment Corp., have not always enjoyed sound financial footing"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2974, ""end"": 3089, ""text"": ""But the station and its manager, Union Station Redevelopment Corp., have not always enjoyed sound financial footing"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	806	2023-05-02T10:31:32.880062Z	2023-05-02T10:32:59.584072Z	468.762
The architectural firm behind the remake of New York’s Grand Central Terminal will lead the effort to plan a $10 billion proposed expansion of Union Station, a project that could triple passenger capacity at the station. Beyer Blinder Belle, with offices in New York and Washington, oversaw design, master planning and the revitalization of Grand Central, turning the 1913 Beaux Arts-style train station into a more modern, accessible and efficient rail hub. The firm has done similar work rehabilitating historic buildings in Washington including for Smithsonian museums. Real estate magnate Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump also hired Beyer Blinder Belle for their transformation of the Old Post Office Pavilion into a luxury hotel. At Union Station, the company will team with Grimshaw Architects to plan a massive expansion of rail and passenger capacity at Union Station that will allow the project to qualify for federal funds in future years. Grimshaw is a specialist in train station design, having worked on the Fulton Center in New York, Amsterdam’s Bijlmer Station and London’s Waterloo rail station. The companies were chosen by the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., which manages Union Station, along with Amtrak and Akridge, a real estate firm planning 3 million square feet of development above the tracks behind the station. Beverley Swaim-Staley, president and chief executive of the development corporation, said in an interview that over the next two to three years the companies would plan and design an expansion that to this point has mostly been envisioned in artists’ renderings. Though the project’s backers are considering a range of public and private options for raising the money needed for the project, major investments from the federal government will be required. Swaim-Staley said that making those requests will require a master plan demonstrating the “economic, transportation and neighborhood value” the expansion would bring to travelers and to Washington. “We need to have the project defined,” Swaim-Staley said. “We need to have a project that everyone can look at and be excited about. Something so that people can understand what the goals are in terms of tripling capacity for passengers coming in and out of the station. This project is going to transform not only Washington, D.C., but the region.” Because Union Station is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and overseen by a bevy of federal and local government bodies, any changes to it require many layers of approvals. A current study, by Philadelphia-based Building Conservation Associates, is reviewing how best to preserve Union Station’s historic characteristics and determining the various ownership stakes in the property. That review is expected to be complete this summer, Swaim-Staley said. Swaim-Staley said she believed the station would benefit from having a team of architects steeped in preservation and re-use of buildings internationally and locally. The development corporation, Amtrak and Akridge are splitting the cost of the work. “They’ve worked on other stations around the country and around the world and also they have an extensive presence in Washington, D.C.,” she said. Amtrak issued a statement from Bob LaCroix, deputy chief of infrastructure and investment in the Northeast, saying that “with growing demand for passenger rail service, it is imperative that we continue to advance our vision for the future of Washington Union Station.” “Once complete, Washington Union Station will be a world-class transportation hub that will provide the region with improved mobility and connectivity for generations to come,” LaCroix said.

Amtrak is proposing a $7 billion transformation of Union Station, intended to triple passenger capacity and transform the overcrowded station into a high-speed rail hub for the Northeast. The plan released last week calls for doubling the number of trains the station can accommodate and improving the passenger experience at what is the second-busiest Amtrak station in the country, with 100,000 passenger trips per day. The building’s corridors, concourses and platforms — many dating to the station’s 1907 opening — are regularly jammed during rush hour and major tourist events. The station’s overcrowded tracks hinder Amtrak and regional train operators from adding new trains despite growing demand. The proposal comes as District-based developer Akridge plans a $1.5 billion complex of offices, residential towers and a hotel near the transportation center. The development, to be built on a deck built over the tracks behind Union Station, would link Capitol Hill to the NoMa neighborhood. Amtrak’s proposal still lacks financing, which even in stages probably could require huge government funding commitments. — Jonathan O’Connell and Ashley Halsey III Starplex Cinemas plans multiplex in Loudoun Starplex Cinemas said last week it plans an 11-screen movie theater in Ashburn as part of a new development called Loudoun Station being built along the Dulles Greenway at Shellhorn Road. Developer Comstock Partners broke ground on the project this spring and ultimately plans more than 3 million square feet, including offices, restaurants, shopping and 1,500 new apartments or condominiums. The multiplex is slated to open in 2014. — Jonathan O’Connell	830	"[{""start"": 0, ""end"": 186, ""text"": ""rak is proposing a $7 billion transformation of Union Station, intended to triple passenger capacity and transform the overcrowded station into a high-speed rail hub for the Northeast"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 188, ""end"": 322, ""text"": ""The plan released last week calls for doubling the number of trains the station can accommodate and improving the passenger experience"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 422, ""end"": 581, ""text"": ""The building’s corridors, concourses and platforms — many dating to the station’s 1907 opening — are regularly jammed during rush hour and major tourist event"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 422, ""end"": 581, ""text"": ""The building’s corridors, concourses and platforms — many dating to the station’s 1907 opening — are regularly jammed during rush hour and major tourist events"", ""labels"": [""causal-query""]}]"	26	804	2023-05-02T10:21:47.991367Z	2023-05-02T10:21:47.991465Z	695.503
For more than a year, travelers heading to or from Union Station have been greeted by the sight of construction equipment as workers have reshaped the plaza and roads in front of the iconic train terminal. The old Columbus Plaza was drab and confusing. Instead of being able to slip out seamlessly after dropping off or picking up passengers, drivers had to loop back through the middle of the plaza to exit. But now, after nearly 18 months of work, the new Columbus Plaza is almost complete, and drivers can exit at one end of the plaza or the other. “The goal of the project was to turn Columbus Plaza into a real circle,” said Ali Shakeri, who oversaw the project for the D.C. Department of Transportation. Cars, buses and taxis began passing through the new exit late last year, and the mess that comes with construction is largely gone. The $8 million project also reworked the rest of the plaza, installing larger sidewalks and new traffic signals. Boxy concrete security barriers were replaced with smaller, less imposing bollards. In coming months, the plaza’s green space will be expanded. “The plaza really needed some attention,” said Thomas Luebke, secretary of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a federal agency that advises on the designs of museums, memorials and other significant public projects. “That very strange configuration of roads . . . didn’t work very well for the station or the public space.” Drivers using the circle recently have praised the new setup, although many noted that congestion remained a problem in front of the station. “It made it more convenient,” Michelle Mitchell, 54, of Southeast Washington said as she sat in her idling car in the plaza on a recent afternoon. She said she has been driving through the plaza for more than 25 years. “It’s great, that new opening, because you have so many choices.” The reconstructed plaza is the latest chapter in Union Station’s evolution. The train terminal, built in 1907, underwent a major restoration in the 1980s. Even bigger changes may be ahead. Last year, planners proposed a $7 billion transformation of the station, aiming to increase capacity and turn it into a high-speed rail hub. Even as cars and planes have changed how many people come to Washington, Union Station has remained a gateway to the nation’s capital, and it’s just blocks from the Supreme Court and the Capitol. Today, it is a terminal for Amtrak, MARC and Virginia Railway Express trains, Greyhound and other intercity bus lines, and Metro. The plaza’s rehabilitation was complicated because of how many agencies have a say in the space. DDOT managed the project, but the National Park Service, Union Station Redevelopment Corp., the Architect of the Capitol and Amtrak were among those with input, Shakeri said Columbus Plaza has a statue of the explorer that was erected in 1912. The plaza’s overhaul will wrap up when the landscaping is completed this month or next. Areas that had been covered by asphalt and used by cars curving toward the exit will be green space. “It’s much more pedestrian friendly,” said Beverley K. Swaim-Staley, president of the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., the nonprofit organization that manages the station. A large part of that, she said, is that it’s more obvious how to cross the plaza. The fact that the plaza is less confusing is a big part of what makes this change important, Luebke said. “Whether you are conscious of it or not, the fact that it’s a more logical, well-maintained public improvement, it registers,” he said. “You feel like you’re entering into a more special place than, say, a cruddy kind of taxi area.” Pedestrians who pass through the plaza each day say they are noticing a difference now that work is winding down. “Everything looks quite a lot nicer,” said Jason Snead, 25, who walks through the plaza each day on his way to and from his job at the Heritage Foundation. “It looks cleaner.” But for some pedestrians navigating the traffic, problems remain in making it through congestion in front of Union Station. “I feel like I’m always dodging cabs,” Racquel Segall, 22, of Baltimore said.	829	"[{""start"": 2038, ""end"": 2178, ""text"": ""Last year, planners proposed a $7 billion transformation of the station, aiming to increase capacity and turn it into a high-speed rail hub."", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 2252, ""end"": 2312, ""text"": ""Union Station has remained a gateway to the nation’s capital"", ""labels"": [""cause""]}, {""start"": 553, ""end"": 709, ""text"": ""The goal of the project was to turn Columbus Plaza into a real circle,” said Ali Shakeri, who oversaw the project for the D.C.
